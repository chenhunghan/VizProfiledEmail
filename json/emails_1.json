This calculation  is to give NNG a better daily number to bill the customer.  Once the   31 Day Charts are in, then they will be delineated with the fixed  delineator.  The meter cards will use the calculation only.   At this time there will NOT be a daily PGAS calculation for 7 day and 16 day  charts.  These charts will be (1) tracked for timely receipt; and (2) integrated for  daily volumes when received.     Any charts received after the required deadline, will be processed as a PPA.

We have arranged for a guard beginning Monday morning. Access to Gas Control will be through the South  hallway and door only. Exit, except for emergencies, will be limited to the South door as well. The guard  will be checking everyones card prior to entry.    We have reviewed the card access lists for all secure doors and removed everyone except Gas Logistics and  IT support staff. We have disabled access into Gas Control on all doors except the South door.   We have cancelled all scheduled meetings and presentations scheduled for the Gas Control Presentation  Center (EB42C1).   2) Isolate the Gas Control Network environment - disconnect our network from the Corporate backbone     We DO NOT intend to Isolate Gas Control until events dictate that we should. We are taking steps to be prepared   to isolate, while minimizing the impact to the Gas Control SCADA system, the TMS system, and PGAS.    On Monday we will also configure the Hangar to support temporary operation of the Gas Control and other Gas Logistics business functions. Two conference rooms and the break room will be configured with phones, network connections,  and workstations. They will be configured to support up to 60 staff. The minimum staffing requirements for the Hangar to support the Gas Control and Gas Logistics functions,as currently defined, is 35 staff. The Hangar will be left configured for approximately two weeks, depending on events. ",

For instance, when we allocate the market area, and Peoples wants to nominate secondary gas within their path, they feel they should have the priority to do so and not be in he mix for a cut.  Teb was highly concerned about this in light of the implications it could have on ultimately changing to a mileage rate base.  Teb argued the point that we rarely cut into firm gas, thus is their threat to file with the Ferc for within the path segmentation really necessary.  He asked that we have an opportunity to review this with them at greater length before they file.  In the meantime, I will look into the number of times we have allocated firm in the market area.  I'm not sure how far back I can get accurate information though.  I'm afraid it will be more memory facts than hard facts.  Sheila",

The point would be to distinquish that its not like someone sat down to bill SoCalGas, read the Global Settlement and agreed with SoCalGas' interpretation of how to bill this.  The point would be to show that we made a mistake in putting the computer programming in-place to handle this.    2. I don't think the GISB 6-mo limitation went into effect until 4/97 -- so arguably it doesn't address this issue.  Nevertheless, I agree with the mistake language.  The GISB transcript excerpts that I clipped for Dari & Chris Sebesta for the IES dispute would be germaine (i.e. GISB didn't intend to bar mistakes ).  3. There is a FERC case that you might want to also cite for the concept of the equity of correcting past mistakes.  Transco discovered an error in their fuel calculation that was many years old.  FERC let them re-bill customers for something like $13 million dollars of undercharges.  I think this is a 2000 case.",

Subject: Outside Professional Services   Shelley, we have been working with a number of Business and IT managers with the termination of IT Consultants.  In some cases, major IT projects have been cancelled and consultants have been eliminated.  There is one project at ETS, the rewrite of the contracts system, that was being staffed by some outside IT consultants ( Valtech).  Has that project been put on hold or discontinued?  If it has and the consultants are no longer here, GSS needs to be in the loop to send termination letters to the supplier.  There is specific termination language in the Master Services Agreements that we manage.     Please let me know the status to the project or direct me to the person who can help me.    Thanks  Tammy Hopkins Enron Global Strategic Sourcing Senior Contracts Manager Work 713-345-6556 Fax 281-664-4825 tamara.hopkins@enron.com http://gss.enron.com/",

The actual EPSQ volume is 5921.5.  TW rounded the volume sown and NNG rounded the volume up. Contract 106525 was manually scheduled down by 1 mmbtu for the Final 8:00 AM Cycle  TMS actions (1)   When you inspect the contract 106252 (NNG), you notice that the EPSQ is 5922 on both receipt and delivery because their is no fuel. (2)   When you inspect the contract 27606 (TW), the EPSQ is 6000 for receipt and 5922 for delivery.  That is calculating each side seperately. (3)   When the volume was entered for 27606, I assumed they entered the receipt side volume of 6000 (EPSQ caclualted from above).  The fuel is then calculated from that  and the delivery side is populated.  The fuel rate is .0131 which calculates the fuel volume of 78.6 (rounded up to 79) which in turn calculates the delivery volume to be  5921.  Jill",

Hamd Alhkayat--Hamd has replaced Andrew Miles in the rotation and will be  helping me with your presentations as well as being the lead with Jeff's  speeches.  Shelley Corman--Shelley has been developing messages for the current and  anticipated gas situation and pipeline safety for the gas pipeline group.   (The safety issue could come up in your Q&A.)  Stinson Gibner--Stinson is with the research group that has generated some of  the more complex slides in your draft dealing with volatility and historic  futures pricing.  Gil Muhl--Gil markets gas products to customers and is speaking at an AGA  conference on the gas supply and price situation the day before your talk.   His group is focusing on new products to help end-users with winter  volatility.  I have asked Gil to send you his presentation as well for the  meeting.  Back to your presentation (the draft slides of which I am delivering to you  today), Dan Yergin thought it would be appropriate for you to give an  overview of the situation as the \"teacher\" or \"professor.\"  Some questions  that you could address would include:  Where has the industry come from, and what lessons have we learned?  How is the business different today?  What public policy conclusions are implicit in this history?  I think our comparative advantage over the specialists who will be presenting  before and after your keynote is that you have \"been there\" in the evolution  of the natural gas market, and Enron is at the forefront of helping customers  deal with price and supply uncertainty.  There is also a good opportunity to  stress the need for new industry \"best practices\" (more hedging) and the  right public policies to deal with this issue (from \"do no harm\" to expanding  incentives in the market).  - Rob  ",

Because we would not have had the final rule prior to Nov. 14, OSHA gives us  until Jan. 16, 2001 to amend a prior written program and bring it in line  with the requirements of 1910.900 (c).

A Must have for ANY Energy professional!     _____    Dear Shelley Corman   Energy Argus' Power Plant Outages service now comes complete with real-time updates, sent to you immediately via instant messenger. Now, not only do you get to search and query the Argus site of plants information, including:   Nuclear units;  Fossil-fired units;  New generation;  Existing capacity;   You now also get instant updates sent by messenger to you - on the platform of your choice - so can act on the news virtually as it happens.   Who need this information - and why?   Analysts and traders need this information: Many of the new proposed plants that were expected to come on line are being cancelled or delayed - meaning that supply will tighten and operating costs will narrow. Each plant outage now has a more severe effect - spiking prices and decreasing supply.  Energy Argus' Power Outages updates give you instant notice of these outages so you can prepare immediately and determine ramifacations on power and fuel prices.     Power industry vendors: Outages mean opportunities - immediate notification means you get your foot in the door first.    WANT MORE INFORMATION?

The best way to reach me is really at work (this address), but I do check the home account a few times a week.  Anyway, how are you?  It must be wierd seeing your own company in the news everyday.  Kim said that you were in a good spot to rebound if you needed to when the dust settles.  That is a relief to us.  As far as the adoption stuff......we still have a long way to go.  Our home study is being written up this week; we've finished the interviews and have all of our documents into the social worker.  We are hopefully going to get notification from the INS to get our fingerprints done within the next week or so.  We're hoping the INS stuff goes quickly, because that is really the only major thing we have left to get done.  We don't know where in Kazakhstan we're gonna go yet, but, we are about a month from getting our name on the referral list; we'll probably find out possible locations then.  I don't know how much Kim relayed to you, but we're hoping for a healthy infant, and the rest doesn't matter as far as preferences.  We are pretty excited already.  How is Alina? (spelling?)  Kim's description of her sounds wonderful.  You guys must be having a terrific time getting to know each other again after a few months separation.  Lets definitely stay in touch.  Maybe the next time you come through DC we can have you over or meet somewhere.  Anyway, say hi to everyone for us.  Love,  Kurt  kschier@market-bridge.com w - 301-961-8936 h - 202-234-8045 Lisa and Kurt Schier 2029 Park Road, NW Washington, DC 20010",

		"_body" : "This memo is on behalf of myself and Lynn Blair.     The following is an update on the status of our effort to resolve/clear past due receivable items currently sitting in the a/r aging report.   A/R-Imbalances, Transportation, Late Pay charges  The attached report reflects all of the remaining A/R items over 30 days related to imbalance, transportation and late pay charges including any unapplied cash.  Gas Logistics has worked very diligently to ensure the A/R is up to date.  Where there were problems, they recruited the help of Marketing and were very successful in bringing closure to some A/R issues.  The items to be included in the write off package (totaling ($3,486.75)) are designated as such and summed separately on the attached report.  Gas Logistics has provided explanations/resolution plans in the right hand column of the report.  To summarize the report, there is exposure of $1,534,792.  Of that, $1,563,897 is made up of four customer issues (Hutchinson Utilities, IES Industries, MidAmerican Energy and Utilicorp-CCI bankruptcy).  There are currently reserves set up for MidAmerican, $221,429 and Utilicorp, $98.496.    Beginning immediately Gas Logistics will include an aging report for all outstanding a/r as part of the customer accounts status package.  This package has been and will continue to be distributed to all  account managers monthly.  Gas Logistics has the initial responsibility to collect payments from shippers and will involve the account manager when an issue or collection problem occurs.  However the account manager will also have the responsibility to keep themselves informed as to the status of their shippers accounts.  The reports provided to them in the customer accounts status package will help them do so.  Work orders  Outstanding work order receivables are being researched and reconciled by Tim Bayles in John Cobb's organization and they plan to resolve these balances independent of the transportation-related effort.  Currently it is our understanding there is approximately $1.2m of outstanding work order receivables with $.6 reserved in December, 2001.  Mike McGowan has offered Laura Lantefield's assistance with getting these resolved.     OBA's  OBA's were not originally included as part of our a/r focus however Gas Logistics is already putting the same effort into resolving/clearing any OBA issues.  Currently OBA's over $200,000 are included in the customer accounts status package.  Gas Logistics is preparing a report similar to the a/r report for OBA's under $200,000.  This report will indicate which OBA's are reconciled and which ones need a resolution plan.    Please let Lynn or I know if you have any further questions.    Dana  Dana L.

Now its stock is down, wall street is bearish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?  by Mimi Swartz </mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.php>  THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like the international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil companies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with modernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, brown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. They are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual uniform of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Republic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the building intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of elevators, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets people entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E tipped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axis; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffeinated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratulating Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between elevator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: \"From the World's Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!\"  For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself from a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 percent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 billion to $100 billion. \"The very mention of the company in energy circles throughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,\" notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides market intelligence to the energy business.  This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determined to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant by then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a company that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, Enron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorporation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If you were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first crack. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. The company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech world, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succeeded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, \"was a great marriage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking mentality of the financial markets.\"  The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the end of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the American economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but the best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those who could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a company couldn't possibly go wrong.  Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of $80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's energy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant project in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who once touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the change in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncertain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture that the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.  ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD \"a totally different way of thinking about business-we got it.\" At Enron, in fact, you either \"got it\" or you were gone-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that the color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahogany floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a black vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white marble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skilling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after just six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (General Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in America (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unchained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, \"someone could actually get killed.\" Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Christmas morning. \"I had no idea what I'd let go of,\" Skilling says of all the personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron.   From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands of working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorced, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwasher. He almost missed his brother's wedding. \"Learning a foreign language-I never learned a foreign language!\" he exclaims. He never once took his youngest son to school. \"I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifteen-minute scheduling.\" Travel: \"You can't go to Africa for a week and get anything out of it!\" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. \"I'm not sure that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job,\" he says, finally. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains its pragmatic edge. \"It would have been easy to stay,\" he says. \"But that would not have been good for me.\"   He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, handsome in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assiduously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at reporters who have labeled his resignation \"bizarre\" and associates who are bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the limits of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put upon. \"I'm surprised,\" he says, \"that people have so much trouble understanding this.\"  PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early nineties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfolding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine to five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the pristine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lurked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in those days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with that scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with such humiliation?  But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighties when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural gas turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies frequently enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a volatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by federal deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanly gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG was then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transco chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doctoral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the Vietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwardly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, HNG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the state of Texas.  HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover attempts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies in the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled \"the purchase\" was being called \"the merger\" back in Houston, and before long, following some particularly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gravity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was running a new company called Enron. \"Over time it became clear that Lay had a better vision of the future,\" says one person associated with Enron at that time. \"He never fought change. He embraced change.\"  Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got started.   LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling had spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he had been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, Illinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) \"I liked being successful when I was working, and I was smart,\" he told BusinessWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than what he would come to call \"intellectual capital.\" He loved being smart, and he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Methodist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and took on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of his class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.   It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worrying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he alone saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world where credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and the price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an investment bank would.  Skilling worked up some numbers and found them \"absolutely compelling.\" Then the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron executives. He had a one-page presentation. \"Almost to a person,\" Skilling says, \"they thought it was stupid.\" Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dejected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and then said, \"Let's go.\"  The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of dozens of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of those divides that seem to define his life: \"I believed this whole world would be different, a huge breakthrough\" is the way Skilling puts it today, and even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, \"We were in.\" And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enron as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just for him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit. After that, says Skilling, \"we never looked back.\"  Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it had a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that would make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to dominate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the best access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could better predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to make trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the price of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but with startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could have ever imagined.  THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had made: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading business. The idea was to build a \"knowledge-based business,\" which demanded a skill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Most were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most of them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed bolder people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. \"Enron was going to create a niche for itself or die,\" one former executive explains. \"The people who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had narrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market.\"  Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the smartest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And because his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the biggest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First Boston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be \"aggressive.\" You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you were thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization.   You could see what he was looking for on \"Super Saturdays\" at the Houston headquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in between-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving ability, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called \"a sense of urgency.\" People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were the types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Maybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lofts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flung suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)  For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-and-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for structuring energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the globe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A company concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning the house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enron never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they could use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were overweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Program. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until ten at night. \"They were so cutting edge,\" rhapsodizes someone involved with the company health care program at the time. \"They really thought about the psychology and what it took to keep these people going.\"  Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that those titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries and decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonuses-with no cap. \"If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could make a lot of money,\" says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years until resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband division. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs joined him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or off-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a spectacular Mexican villa. \"Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'd say,\" one loyalist says.   And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas merchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the buzzword was \"aggressive,\" that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay believed the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business. Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better service at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they began barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power company presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly service areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who were somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying efforts).  But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay made him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations largest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The division had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $2 billion to $7 billion. \"Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track,\" the New York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skilling had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to transforming another.  \"FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,\" sang the New York Times in 1999. \"In the staid world of regulated utilities and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis,\" crowed Fortune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetable, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to discover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, steel, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedge against the usual winter downturn?  But most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech communications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline became another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades online in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bid price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enron, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empty lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from trading the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for what the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. \"Its strategy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commodities can help it do well even in an uncertain market,\" BusinessWeek insisted.  There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: the company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of customer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle customers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had to come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business clients as customers and began calling them \"counterparties.\"  Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were maximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk venture quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oil-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to underwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its markets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happened at all.   While many businesses used what was known in the industry as \"mark-to-market accounting,\" for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The company priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't get deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like annuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. However many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there might be something fishy about what they called \"subjective accounting,\" investors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the market fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a project that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't going to be high enough. \"Enron is known for leaving people at the altar,\" says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the company could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a contribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's competing literacy charity: \"Even the person who was supposed to give money away for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron,\" he says.  As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the Enron family put it, \"It became a company full of mercenaries.\" The change started at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like the commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported overhearing orders like \"I need a smart person-go buy me one\" or \"Buy me an intelligent slave, quick.\" Enron had never been the kind of place where people sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-parody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was too disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.  And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by Skilling in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking system in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and those with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname quickly became \"rank and yank.\") It was a point of pride that Skilling's division replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling associate put it, \"Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery store.\" Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enron's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' attitude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading culture, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enron higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World, he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially more lucrative project was pending elsewhere.  Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: \"They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost sight of the future,\" says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close deals within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-ups who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so often as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase \"No old tapes\" became an Enron clich?. \"People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight,\" says one former Enron executive.  In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restrictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company. E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, one for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, but they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture this way: \"They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while you bleed to death.\"  BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy company into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: Just as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of its remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dealt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who dealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enron's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building projects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enormous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. \"It wasn't the time for long-term approaches,\" an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood. \"It was the technology era.\"  To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebecca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many years the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her nickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had the requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of Enron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed $20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent of Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-one Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including two appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corporate America.  But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, India, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron way: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 percent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three changes in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and other Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals, and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.  Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisions were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firing lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relentless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keeping a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly difficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company as smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disaster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mark her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water utility that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water privatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greatest water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like another sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million.   But Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not like gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, and confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much diminished, was folded into Enron. \"I think it's best for Rebecca to start afresh,\" Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal. Or as one critic put it, \"They were more interested in destroying the old culture than running a business.\"   As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay announced the inevitable: \"The best time for the succession to occur is when the company is doing well,\" he told the press. \"Enron is doing extremely well now.\" In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.  ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debacle. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying the company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (Lay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to George W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying food or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in California, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had tried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy deregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its weaknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in January.  Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of constant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situation was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim that the state had never built enough power plants to service its population and never properly managed those it had. \"For three months Gray Davis did a very good job of blaming us,\" says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corporate communications. \"We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the White House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his biggest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take care of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis.\" (California utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's all too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a joke comparing California with the Titanic. (\"At least the Titanic went down with its lights on.\")  But the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billion in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too did the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first time in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to market. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds, Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.  Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, the stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. During the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who challenged Enron's financial reporting an \"asshole.\" When the company reported hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profits had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old assets. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling promised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. \"There wasn't any positive news,\" Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says now. \"Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade.\"  The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had asked in March whether Enron was overpriced. (\"Start with a pretty straightforward question: How exactly does Enron make its money?\") The routine cashing in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portrayed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken Lay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Journal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife within the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possible failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in the stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutionally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. \"When Wall Street is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,\" says Carol Coale. \"When a company falls out of favor, all these issues carry more weight.\"  This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started experiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their secretaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of their ways. \"It just created an attitude,\" one executive still at Enron says. \"If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? There was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'\"   Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardship duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. \"But,\" as one Houston oilman explains, \"if you have to negotiate a hardship duty with someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporation that's better suited for good times than bad.\"  As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the stock price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employees killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for him, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but \"innovate much closer to our core.\" As for the culture: \"Things like the Performance Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to categorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a morale problem.\"  That Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure with Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always believed in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them when the company was in trouble, it was different. \"Even Jeff's biggest detractors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door,\" one loyalist admits.  But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. \"Look,\" he says with finality, \"ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my interests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely.\"  Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling himself back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new technologies. \"The first wave never gets it right,\" he says. \"The stand-alone dot-coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a second wave that will change the world.\" Houston, he promises, will become the world's center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In fact, he is already shopping for office space.  \"This is the second wave, and Enron's got it,\" he says, almost breathless. \"There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that get it.\"",

Historically, I understand that the Gas Controllers on duty have not moved to the stairwells during a drill. We need to change that practice. We are required by the Fire Marshall to have everyone move to the stairwells during future fire drills. The short time normally required to be away from the console until the all-clear is sounded should not impact the integrity of the pipeline systems.   We are also reviewing our short notice emergency response procedures. We have excellent procedures for events such as hurricanes, but we are preparing for events, such as a threat that would require everyone to leave the building immediately. Our interim offsite location in these situations is the Enron hanger at Intercontinental Airport. In the near future, we will be conducting a drill of these procedures, so don't be surprised if someone from our management team comes into Gas Control and asks you to proceed to the hanger on short notice.

		"_body" : "  News; Domestic  Interview with General Tommy Franks  Aaron Brown, John King, Bill Hemmer, Bob Franken, Sheila MacVicar, Jason Bellini    01/11/2002  CNN: Special Report With Aaron Brown   (c) Copyright eMediaMillWorks, Inc. (f/k/a Federal Document Clearing House, Inc.). All Rights Reserved.     We said last night that the collapse of Enron had been largely underreported. That has now changed, as you will hear tonight, and it is that story, Enron that begins our whip around the world. We start at the White House and our Senior White House Correspondent John King. John, a headline from you, please.   JOHN KING, SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Aaron, because of Enron's political connections, the nation's top prosecutor, the Attorney General John Ashcroft and his chief of staff, today had to recuse themselves from the growing criminal investigation into the company's bankruptcy. Why? Because John Ashcroft took a lot of money from Enron and its chief executives.   The administration also, for the first time today, acknowledged the Enron CEO called two cabinet members before the company filed for bankruptcy and asked for help. The administration insists it didn't help him and that it did nothing wrong. Aaron.   BROWN: John, a lot on Enron tonight. We'll be back with you shortly.   (COMMERCIAL BREAK)   BROWN: Enron exploded today. It's been a while since the energy company, the trading company, a Fortune 500 giant went bankrupt, costing investors including the company's employees billions of dollars.   The story has simmered around for a while, overwhelmed by the war, waiting its time in the way a good story does, and the time has finally come. Last night, we reported the Justice Department was opening a criminal investigation, and today the case took a political turn as well, a turn that could well be the first real threat to the Bush Administration.   Developments to report, lots of them. We go back to the White House and Senior White House Correspondent John King. John, good evening.   KING: Good evening to you, Aaron. A complicated story anyway because of the facts, even more so because of the politics. If you brought together senior officials in the Bush Administration and said, everyone with ties to Enron raise your hands, a lot of hands would go up.   The President knows the CEO quite well. He's an old family friend. So does the Vice President and his Chief of Staff. The President's top political adviser is close to Enron, so is his top economic adviser. Several members of the cabinet too. The White House insists though, there has been no questionable behavior. There are though, a lot of questions.   (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)   KING (voice over): Attorney General John Ashcroft is recusing himself from the criminal investigation of Enron, as is his Chief of Staff. The reason, $60,000 in political contributions from Enron and its top executives in Campaign 2000, when Ashcroft was running for reelection to the Senate.   Another reflection of the political stakes in the Oval Office, the President himself announcing two new cabinet level reviews to determine if the government needs stronger disclosure laws to protect shareholders and investors in 401 (k) and other retirement plans.   GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I have great concern for the stories, for those I read about in the stories who put their life savings aside and for whatever reason, based upon some rule or regulation, got trapped in this awful bankruptcy and have lost life savings.   KING: Energy giant, Enron, first gave a public hint of its financial troubles last October, and then filed for bankruptcy in early December, a major economic story in any event and a major political story too because Enron and its CEO, Ken Lay, have deep connections to the Bush family and in both political parties in Congress.   BUSH: I have never discussed with Mr. Lay the financial problems of the company.   KING: But Lay did alert top Bush deputies that Enron was in trouble, and asked for help well before the December bankruptcy filing. He called Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, and Commerce Secretary Don Evans, in late October and O'Neill a second time in early November.   Sources say Lay wanted help shoring up the company's bond rating. Aides say Secretaries O'Neill and Evans decided there was nothing the government could or should do. The White House says they did not pass the news on to the President or any other senior administration officials.   ARI FLEISCHER, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The President is pleased with the actions that his cabinet secretaries took. He thinks they acted wisely and properly.   Lay is an old Bush family friend, and he and his company a major donor to both political parties. In the 2000 campaign cycle alone, Enron and its executives contributed more than $2.2 million to federal candidates and political committees; $74,000 went to the Bush Campaign; $1.5 million to other Republican campaigns and committees; and $640,000 to the Democrats.   Four Congressional committees are also investigating Enron, and Democrats want more information on the company's contacts with the Bush White House.   (END VIDEOTAPE)   KING (on camera): In hindsight, and there is always hindsight it seems in such cases, top Bush Administration officials say yes, they wish word of those contacts between Ken Lay, the Enron CEO, and Bush cabinet secretaries came out sooner, but they say in the end, any investigation will show this, that a top Bush fundraiser asked for help and was told no, and that this President now is showing no hesitancy at all in investigating a man who's not only a top political supporter, but a long-time family friend. Aaron.   BROWN: You could almost hear Democrats smacking their lips a little bit on this one. Was the White House, in the briefings today and around the building, defensive about this or did they seem, people seem comfortable that they're OK?   KING: Quite defensive about it, Aaron. Some phone calls after the White House briefing by officials saying, why so many questions about this? This is an administration of unquestioned integrity. Why do you want to know all these things?   But they also understand now, many Democrats in the Congress saw the investigations of the Clinton Administration, subpoenas for documents in cases that the Clintons thought were way out of bounds, no questions should be asked. The Democrats will ask questions about this. So will reporters.   The Bush Administration I think got the message today that they have to be quicker and more forthcoming in releasing any, any details at all of consultations or conversations with this company. Again, they say in the end, they will be proven that the President did nothing wrong, and that in fact, his two cabinet secretaries, one Don Evans a very close friend of Ken Lay, said no when this man asked for help.   BROWN: And just one other quick thing, the decision to have a White House -- are these White House investigations into Enron, or White House discussions about disclosure laws dealing with investments and investors generally?   KING: There are a number of investigations, so it gets confusing. The Justice Department, even though the Attorney General and the U.S. Attorney and most of his staff in Houston, have recused themselves because of political relationships or other relationships. The Justice Department is having a criminal investigation.   The Labor Department oversees pensions. It has a separate investigation into the pension programs. Now there will be two cabinet level taskforces headed by the Treasury Department, that involve other departments including the Securities and Exchange Commission, to see if the government did something wrong here, if you will, if there should be stronger rules that require an Enron, when its finances are going south, to tell its shareholders and especially to tell its employees who have so much stock in those 401 (k) plans. All the Enron executives who knew about this sold their stock. The employees lost their life savings. The President wants to know if the government needs to make sure that doesn't happen again.   BROWN: John, the old wire service reported that you are -- you probably want to chase the fire that's going on somewhere in D.C.   KING: We get those out here.   BROWN: Yes, thank you for your work tonight. Senior White House Correspondent John King. We said that the Enron collapse is both a political story and a business story. It's a complicated story to be sure. Tonight, we're joined by someone who can help us understand both the business and the politics of this. Jim Glassman writes a weekly Washington Post investment column. He's also a Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. He joins us tonight from New York. Jim, good evening.   JAMES GLASSMAN, HOST, TECHCENTRALSTATION.COM: Good evening, Aaron.   BROWN: How could so many -- I mean if you looked at all of the mutual funds and all the investment houses that recommended Enron, the stock price shot way up. It looked like a terrific company. How could so many smart people have been so dumb?   GLASSMAN: They didn't just recommend it, they owned it. I mean companies like Janus, Fidelity. There are a lot of analysts that have conflicts of interest, but many of them, who did not, really praised this company to the sky. Fortune named it six years in a row, the most innovative company in America.   Basically, what was going on was that Enron was deceiving investors, deceiving analysts, overstating the profits it was making, hiding some of the loans that it had taken out, and as soon as this was found out, the company basically got capital punishment, which in my opinion it deserved. And I think it's a good lesson to other companies not to deceive investors.   Now, the question of whether it did something illegal or not, is another matter. Just the fact that it was very clearly trying to say that it was in much better shape than it was. Unfortunately, a lot of little people got hurt.   BROWN: I want to talk about that, but are you telling me that a company can mislead investors, mislead the public about how much money it's actually making or how much debt it actually has, and that is not in and of itself a crime?   GLASSMAN: Well, what Enron was doing specifically about the debt was, it was reporting that it had $14 billion in debt. It really had about three times that much, and the other debt was pushed off onto other related entities, and it was very, very difficult for any analyst or the public to find out about it.   Now, it's very difficult to pass enough accounting rules to take care of every shenanigan that a company's going to come up with. What you need is a market and investors who will crack down really, really hard on companies that are being deceptive, if not dishonest, and that's what's happened in this case. But yes, it's not hard to hide things. It's not hard at all to hide things.   BROWN: That's comforting to know for those of us who have money in the market.   GLASSMAN: But you know, Aaron, really the way to prevent yourself from getting burned is by being diversified. Things are going to happen like Enron, and there have been other cases. There are not that many of them, but there are other cases. And if you have a huge chunk of your retirement savings in one company, this kind of thing can happen, a company that looks good in all of its aspects and bang, it turns out that it's not on the level.   BROWN: But that's exactly what happened to the employees, that their 401 (k) money --   GLASSMAN: Yes. Yes.   BROWN: -- was going into the company and worse, they were not allowed to sell it.   GLASSMAN: Yes, and I think that's a much more serious problem, and that's what some of the policymakers in Washington are looking into, and I think there's a lesson for your viewers. You know, most companies make it easy for you, as an employee, to buy corporate stock and the problem that you get into is that if you lose your job, not only have you lost your everyday livelihood, but you also may have lost a big chunk of your retirement savings if your company goes out of business, as Enron did.

USA: Enron's Lay called Greenspan in October.    01/11/2002  Reuters English News Service   (C) Reuters Limited 2002.     WASHINGTON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Enron Corp.'s Chairman Kenneth Lay telephoned Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Oct. 26, a Fed spokesman confirmed on Friday.   The spokesman would not say what was discussed during the conversation but he did say that Greenspan did not follow up the call with any action.  \"He did nothing in response to the call. It would have been inappropriate,\" the spokesman said.   The White House has said Lay called U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans in the autumn. The White House said the two officials opted to do nothing about their calls.   The Justice Department on Wednesday announced it had opened a criminal investigation into the energy trading company, whose December bankruptcy threw thousands out of work, devastated investors and wiped out the pension plans of many employees when its stock price plunged.    .....................................................................................................................................     Trading of Enron shares halted; judge delays announcement on auction process  By ALAN CLENDENNING  AP Business Writer    01/11/2002  Associated Press Newswires   Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.     NEW YORK (AP) - Beleaguered Enron Corp. planned to select one of two suitors to buy its wholesale energy trading operation in an auction expected to end late Friday morning, a source familiar with the situation said.   The auction was being held in private and the selection of a buyer was expected to be announced at a bankruptcy court hearing that was originally scheduled for 10 a.m., but was delayed until noon.  Trading in Enron shares was delayed Friday morning on the New York Stock Exchange as negotiations for a sale continued pending an anticipated announcement.   Enron said late Thursday that negotiations for a sale were continuing through the night.   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said early Friday that the talks were continuing and the field had been narrowed to two, but declined to name the suitors. Investment banks that reportedly have an interest in buying into Enron include Citigroup Inc. and UBS Warburg.   In a related matter, Judge Arthur Gonzalez said he expected to rule Friday on a request to transfer the bankruptcy case to Houston.   Gonzalez will have the final word Friday on any sale that takes place as a result of the auction. More than a dozen Enron creditors have filed objections to the sale, essentially because they want a better explanation of how the proceeds will be divvied up.   Dissatisfied creditors will have 10 days to appeal Gonzalez's ruling.   Before its collapse late last year, Enron was the world's largest energy merchant, accounting for roughly 25 percent of all trades in a market it helped pioneer. Enron differed from competitors in its penchant for complex bets on everything under the sun - advertising space, broadband, paper, the weather and more than 1,000 other products.    .....................................................................................................................................     Widening probe of Texas-based Enron could dog Bush as Whitewater plagued Clinton  By TOM RAUM  Associated Press Writer    01/11/2002  Associated Press Newswires   Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.     WASHINGTON (AP) - The expanding investigation into the collapse of Enron Corp. and the company's close ties to the Bush administration could quickly turn into a consuming political liability for President George W. Bush in spite of his currently high approval ratings. And Democrats are pressing hard for just that.   At this point, no one is alleging wrongdoing by Bush or top members of his administration in the bankruptcy of the Houston-based energy trading company, a failure that cost thousands of jobs and ravaged the retirement savings of many employees.  But such investigations tend to take on a life of their own. And Democrats, sensing a congressional election-year opportunity, are working hard to turn up the heat.   Some Democrats are likening the probe to the Whitewater and campaign fund-raising investigations that plagued former President Bill Clinton.   \"The reason this is so potentially devastating to Bush is that it brings to life in very real terms the notion that when push comes to shove, he's for the big business special interests and not for the little guy,\" said former Clinton press secretary Joe Lockhart.   The controversy deepened on Thursday with the disclosure by the White House that Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay, a longtime friend of the president, called two of Bush's Cabinet officers - Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans - before the company filed for bankruptcy late last year.   The disclosure came a day after the Justice Department announced it was opening a criminal investigation of the energy company's collapse, including whether it defrauded investors by deliberately concealing information about its finances.   Attorney General John Ashcroft, who received campaign contributions from Enron executives during his failed 2000 senatorial bid, stepped aside from the investigation.   The collapse, the largest corporate bankruptcy ever, is also being probed by the Labor Department and by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is looking into the company's destruction of possibly key financial documents; and by five congressional committees.   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, leading one of those inquiries, is promising \"a search for the truth, not a witch hunt.\"   But some Republicans - including White House spokesman Ari Fleischer - used just that term, \"witch hunt,\" on Thursday in describing the widening investigation.   \"There's not even smoke here, let alone a fire,\" said Charles Black, a veteran Republican consultant.   \"They can keep it going in terms of probing Enron, looking into what happened to those people who lost their pensions, what happened to the accounting. All those are legitimate issues,\" said Black. \"But there's no evidence that any elected officials did anything for Enron.\"   Bush, a former Texas oilman himself, on Thursday told reporters, \"I have never discussed with Mr. Lay the financial problems of the company.\" And Fleischer said that no one in the administration offered to intervene on Enron's behalf.   \"This is hardly going to be a scandal that brings down President Bush, but it will be a nagging problem for the Bush administration for some time to come,\" said Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist.   But Sabato said it has all the ingredients to become all-consuming \"because the Bush administration is so laden with corporate types and people with ties to the energy industry. It's understandable to the American people. It's the big boys versus the little guys who got hurt.\"   \"These things can be an enormous distraction. But by the end of the Clinton administration, we learned that the best thing to do is assign a team to disclose everything, and to keep everyone else out of it,\" said Paul Begala, a former Clinton political adviser.   Lanny Davis, who was special counsel to Clinton from 1996 to 1998, urged Democrats to not take the same low road he claims Republicans took in pursuing the Whitewater and related inquiries.   He said so far he sees nothing in the Enron case to link Bush administration officials to the collapse other than innuendo. \"Let's go after the serious stuff,\" including why Enron employees were prevented from unloading their Enron stock in their company-managed retirement plans as the share prices plunged from over dlrs 80 to under dlrs 1, Davis said.   ---   EDITOR'S NOTE - Tom Raum has covered national and international affairs for The Associated Press since 1973.    .....................................................................................................................................

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES     NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- A federal bankruptcy judge here delayed a much-awaited hearing on Enron Corp.'s (ENE) motion to sell some of its energy-trading assets until noon Friday - signaling that the company may still be working to cement a last-minute deal with bidders.  The hearing, before Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez in the bankruptcy court of the Southern District of New York, was originally scheduled for 10 a.m. EST.   The judge said he plans later in the day to decide upon a motion by some of Enron's creditors to transfer the bankruptcy case to Houston, where the company is headquartered.   -By Kathy Chu; Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5394    .....................................................................................................................................     USA: Enron slated to decide today on trading unit bidder.    01/11/2002  Reuters English News Service   (C) Reuters Limited 2002.     NEW YORK, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. said it aims to make a decision by 11:00 a.m. EST (1600 GMT) on which company was the successful bidder for its trading operations.   Martin Bienenstock, an Enron attorney, said Enron is still choosing between two bidders to take control of Enron's trading operations. He didn't name the companies. A decision is expected to be presented for approval to U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Arthur Gonzalez at a morning hearing in New York, he said.  Citigroup and UBS Warburg have been in the running to buy up to 51 percent of Enron's energy trading unit, which was put up for auction this week after the Houston-based energy trader declared bankruptcy Dec. 2. London based oil company BP said it was also interested in some parts of the unit.   \"I suspect we will have a decision by 11:00 a.m., but the auction is continuing,\" said Bienenstock in an interview. Negotiators worked late into the night on Thursday to haggle the best possible offer for the trading operations, Enron said.    .....................................................................................................................................     USA: Enron shares halted for news pending.    01/11/2002  Reuters English News Service   (C) Reuters Limited 2002.     NEW YORK, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Trading in shares of troubled energy giant Enron Corp. was halted early on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange and over-the-counter.   Enron stock was halted for news pending at 67 cents per share on the NYSE as well as over the counter.  Enron, once the dominant energy trader in North America, declared bankruptcy after admissions of murky dealings in early December, which all but closed down trading operations.   In recent developments, Arthur Andersen, Enron's accounting firm, has said it destroyed papers relating to Enron's finances.   Enron's chairman, Ken Lay, also was said to have approached two top Bush administration officials before filing for bankruptcy.    .....................................................................................................................................     Enron Fall Renews Interest In Electricity Clearinghouse  By Kristen McNamara    01/11/2002  Dow Jones Energy Service   (Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)     Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES     NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Energy companies' increased concern about exposure to their trading partners following the meltdown of former energy giant Enron Corp. (ENE) has renewed interest in the development of clearinghouses for the North American electricity markets.  It's long been thought that the continent's power markets could benefit from a formal clearing function, in which a central institution extends financial guarantees on trades. Impediments that frustrated past efforts remain, but Enron's rapid collapse and the tighter credit standards faced by the rest of the industry have given clearinghouse backers new ammunition.   \"The idea was already in people's heads that it was something good to have,\" said Jim Walker, senior analyst at Forrester Research Inc., a technology research firm in Cambridge, Mass. \"The Enron situation made people think we need to get it faster.\"   Enron, formerly the largest wholesale trader of electricity and natural gas, filed for bankruptcy protection Dec. 2. The former titan's fall stunned the industry and led to increased scrutiny of power companies' credit by ratings agencies and trading partners.   The U.S. power markets - which Forrester Research estimates traded $446 billion worth of wholesale electricity in 2001 - lack a central exchange. Most power is traded over the counter, with companies contacting each other directly and left on the hook if their counterparty defaults.   A clearinghouse would protect against counterparty default and reduce the amount of collateral companies must post to back their trades, analysts said. Under such a system, the clearinghouse sets margin requirements and acts as counterparty to every trade. It collects fees and in return steps in to cover defaults.   A number of energy companies, including Sempra Energy (SRE), Williams Cos. (WMB), Mirant Corp. (MIR) and Consolidated Edison Inc. (ED) said they welcome the idea.   \"We certainly support that idea and think it would be beneficial and would go a long way toward helping to manage the credit risk of the counterparties,\" Sempra spokesman Doug Kline said.   Clearing For Takeoff     Anticipating increased demand for insulation against trading risk, several organizations plan to roll out clearing services for electricity markets this year.   The New York Mercantile Exchange, the world's largest energy marketplace, hopes to offer clearing services to power traders sometime in 2002, spokeswoman Nachamah Jacobovits said. Nymex began extending clearing services to the over-the-counter markets for natural gas products in November.   \"We have accelerated because of the Enron problems,\" Jacobovits said.   IntercontinentalExchange, a fast-growing Internet-based marketplace backed by a number of leading energy companies and banks, is also exploring the possibility of expanding its clearing function to include electricity, Senior Vice President David Goone said.   \"There's tremendous demand to start coming up with a clearing solution for the electricity marketplace,\" Goone said. \"Clearing would allow more participants to trade.\"   Because the exchange is still hammering out the details, Goone wouldn't say which electricity products might be covered or when clearing services would be in place.   ICE, which last year bought London's International Petroleum Exchange, the world's second-largest energy futures exchange, has an agreement with the London Clearing House to provide clearing services for natural gas and crude oil trades done on ICE beginning in the first quarter of 2002.   A third company called EnergyClear, based in Houston, plans to launch a clearinghouse for electricity and natural gas in the next three to six months, according to Jimmy Wright, senior vice president of business development.   Energy companies will own and govern the clearinghouse itself. The Bank of New York (BK) and brokers Prebon Yamane and Amerex own a unit that will operate the clearinghouse.   EnergyClear has the technology and regulatory approval to clear trades, but must get its membership and governing rules in place before it can begin operating, Wright said. The effort was stalled as energy companies shifted their attention to sorting out their exposure to Enron, Wright said.   \"We lost probably weeks or a month, if not more, of productive time,\" he said.   The Hard Part     Despite the support, analysts said it's difficult to estimate how much business a clearinghouse could actually do. Developing a clearing function for electricity will be more complicated than for other commodities because of the volatility of power prices and the Balkanized nature of the electricity markets - with rules, products and liquidity varying from region to region, energy experts said.   Nymex tried and failed to create a market for electricity futures - standard products traded on a regulated exchange with clearing and settlement services. Electricity futures failed to catch on with energy companies as a risk-management tool, in part because there isn't a national benchmark to use as reference point.   \"As liquidity develops in highly traded benchmark products, they will want to have a clearinghouse for those products,\" Walker said.   Thus far, companies have been reluctant to pay for clearing services in the electricity markets, said Ken Nichols, president of NexClear Inc. NexClear spent two years trying to develop an electricity-market clearinghouse, but gave up last summer when it couldn't secure enough money to start up.   \"The willingness to pay has not been there,\" Nichols said. \"How many more examples does the industry need to realize the cost of mitigating credit risk?\"   A standard set of rules governing the trading operations of each region might be necessary before a clearinghouse could begin operating, said Joseph Oates, vice president for energy management, at Consolidated Edison Co.   Federal energy regulators are pushing utilities and grid operators to develop uniform regional markets with standard rules. It's not clear how quickly these could be up and running. But the independent power-grid managers around the country generally offer clearing and settlement services in the markets they operate, and those could be expanded as the so-called independent system operators and regional transmission organizations grow.   \"It is these ISOs, these RTOs that are right in the middle of these markets and probably need to take on the function of not just being the traffic cop in these markets but also the referee and auctioneer that makes these markets work,\" Larry Makovich, senior director for electric power research at the Cambridge Energy Research Associates said.   -By Kristen McNamara, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2061; kristen.mcnamara@dowjones.com   (Jon Kamp in Chicago contributed to this article.)    .....................................................................................................................................     WHITE HOUSE WATCH: Enron Story Heats Up At White House    01/11/2002  Dow Jones International News   (Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)     (This article was originally published Thursday)   By Alex Keto   A Dow Jones Newswires Analysis     WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The long-simmering story over the collapse of Enron (ENE) and its political contributions to President George W. Bush heated up considerably Thursday with the revelation that Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay pleaded for help from the administration while his company was going down in flames.  Administration officials turned Lay down, but the news brings the issues of political contributions and political favors into uncomfortably close proximity.   For his part, Bush said he was out of the loop.   \"I have never discussed with Mr. Lay the financial problems of the company. The last time that I saw Mr. Lay was at my mother's fund-raising event for literacy in Houston. That would have been last spring,\" Bush said.   Bush went on to say he wants to see a full investigation into Enron's bankruptcy, the largest in U.S. history.   \"What anybody's going to find out is that this administration will fully investigate issues such as the Enron bankruptcy, to make sure we can learn from the past and make sure workers are protected,\" Bush said.   Nevertheless, the White House appeared to be buffeted by fast-moving events with White House spokesman Ari Fleischer denying at midday there was any conflict of interest in having Attorney General John Ashcroft, who received political contributions from Enron as a Senate candidate, oversee a criminal probe of the company's bankruptcy. Less then two hours later, Ashcroft and a top aide recused themselves from the investigation.   Shortly after the Ashcroft announcement, Arthur Andersen LLP, the company that served as Enron's auditors, announced that a \"significant\" number of the company's documents and records had been destroyed. Both federal and congressional investigators have been seeking the documents.   Fleischer said that during the autumn Lay called Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill to warn him that Enron was on the verge of collapse, and Lay said the bankruptcy of his company could be as destabilizing as the implosion of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund in the late 1990s.   However, upon investigation, the Treasury Department rejected Lay's arguments.   Later, Lay called Commerce Secretary Don Evans to say \"he (Lay) was having problems with his bond rating and he was worried about its impact on the energy sector.\"   Evans then called O'Neill but \"they both agreed no action should be taken to intervene with their bond holders,\" Fleischer said.   Even before the latest revelations, the White House had confirmed Vice President Dick Cheney or his aides met with Enron officials six times last year to discuss energy issues while the White House was drawing up its energy plan .   However, Fleischer said the fact that Lay and others were talking to top officials isn't in and of itself a crime.   \"I want to remind you that communication is not a wrongdoing. What took place here was, they received phone calls and took no action. The charge has been, did the government take any action? And the answer from these two officials is no,\" Fleischer said.   \"I think it should surprise no one that people in the administration receive phone calls from people who are either in business or at unions. It happens everyday,\" Fleischer said.   However, some of Fleischer's assertions were, to be blunt, surprising.   To begin with, Fleischer said Thursday morning was the first time that O'Neill and Evans mentioned to Bush they had been in contact with Lay in the weeks just ahead of the company's bankruptcy.   In addition, Fleischer said no one in the administration briefed Bush about Enron's woes and he was hard pressed to say how the president learned the company had gone belly up late last year.   \"He learned last fall. And I couldn't tell you if he learned as a result of the media accounts when everybody wrote that Enron had gone bankrupt or through any other mechanism. He learned last fall,\" Bush said.   However, this explanation appeared to be rather thin considering that Bush was fully informed and deeply involved in the financial bailout of the nation's airlines at the same time in part because thousands of jobs were at risk. Enron employed 20,000 workers.   Asked if, in hindsight, the president wished he had been better informed of the developments at Enron and among his top officials, Fleischer said, \"No.\"   Adding to the White House's discomfort is the fact that Democrats on Capitol Hill are gearing up for hearings on Enron. Fleischer warned them against going too far.   \"It's appropriate to take a look into what led to the bankruptcy of Enron and whether or not anything was done wrong in the process of Enron going bankrupt. But if that's a politically charged, a politically motivated effort, then I think the American people are going to say that this is just another fishing expedition, another endless investigation, the type that they soured on over the last many years,\" Fleischer said.     Bush Warns Iran Not To Shelter Fleeing Al-Qaida     Following reports that Iran may be sheltering small numbers of fleeing al-Qaida or Taliban fighters and trying to control Afghanistan's western provinces, Bush bluntly warned Tehran it will be held accountable for any moves to terrorism or terrorists.   \"Any nation that thwarts our ability to rout terror out where it exists will be held to account one way or the other,\" Bush said.   \"We had some positive signals early - early in this war from - from the Iranians. We would hope that they would continue to be a positive force in helping us bring people to justice. We would hope, for example, they wouldn't allow al-Qaida murderers to hide in their country. We would hope that if that be the case, if someone tries to flee into Iran, that they would hand them over to us,\" Bush added,   Bush also told Tehran to keep its hands off of Afghanistan's fragile government and hinted the U.S. response could be sharp.   \"If they, in any way, shape or form, try to destabilize the government, the coalition will be - will deal with them in, you know, in diplomatic ways, initially,\" Bush said.   For what its worth, Iran denied it was either undercutting the Kabul government or hiding terrorists.   \"It has been our policy not to allow terrorist groups such as al-Qaida in Iran,\" Vice President Mohammad Ali Abtahi told The Associated Press.   The U.S. has long considered Iran a major backer of international terrorism.   Certainly, Abtahi's comments didn't sway Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.   \"We know that (Afghanistan-Iran) has a porous border and we know people have moved back and forth throughout history. And we also know they've been moving back and forth in recent history,\" Rumsfeld said.   -By Alex Keto, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-9256; Alex.Keto@Dowjones.com    .....................................................................................................................................     POINT OF VIEW: A New Champion For Disclosure: Bush    01/11/2002  Dow Jones News Service   (Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)     (This article was originally published Thursday.)     By Neal Lipschutz   A Dow Jones Newswires Column     NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Corporate disclosure found a high-profile champion Thursday: the president of the United States.  It's not often that the chief executive of the world's most powerful nation concerns himself with issues such as what public companies should have to tell investors. That's what cabinet officers and federal agency heads are for.   But President George W. Bush was provoked Thursday to announce the creation of a high-level working group to study disclosure rules to see if they need to be improved.   The reason for this comes down to one word: Enron.   In light of the Chapter 11 filing by former high-flying Enron Corp., Bush said Thursday that he was forming a working group consisting of representatives of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to review disclosure rules, Dow Jones Newswires reported.   Many of Enron's woes stemmed from lightly reported off-balance-sheet transactions. Now, it's unlikely that the SEC needs the help of all these other  agencies   to get the job done. It embarked, pre-Enron, on a broad effort to  improve and make \"current\" corporate disclosure of material  developments. This might be a case of too many cooks.     But it still has to be counted as a silver lining of the Enron mess that a better disclosure regime will now get the crisis-induced impetus often needed to create real change.   Assuming this working group brings back a plan that really will make companies disclose more of their pertinent financials in a timely and understandable way, Bush will have no choice but to back it.   After all, he formed the working group. And it's in his political interest, given his and the administration's relationship with Enron's leaders, to back some regulatory lessons from the company's downfall and impose a more transparent regimen of accounting.   For its part, the SEC, under Chairman Harvey L. Pitt, should tell its colleagues at the other agencies joining the working group that it already has a plan. The SEC then needs to flesh it out in an appropriate way and win the backing of the other agencies.   Enron's failure is an opportunity to overcome the business-as-usual objections that are bound to rise from a proposal that would significantly alter and improve the way companies report important developments to investors.   Notwithstanding the bureaucratic drag of a working group, the support of a popular president for such a usually obscure effort has got to be a big plus in getting something done.

Enron Confirms CEO Lay Made Calls To Top Govt Officials  By Christina Cheddar    01/11/2002  Dow Jones News Service   (Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)     Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES   (This report was originally published Thursday.)     NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) Thursday confirmed its chairman and chief executive, Kenneth Lay, contacted top Bush administration officials to warn that bankruptcy was a possibility for the Houston energy trader.  Earlier Thursday, White House officials said Lay contacted Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans prior to the company's bankruptcy filing in early December.   \"Lay made phone calls to tell senior government officials about the situation at Enron,\" an Enron spokesman said. \"He told them that we were working to avoid bankruptcy, but it couldn't be ruled out. He didn't ask for anything. He was giving information.\"   According to the spokesman, Lay thought the officials needed to know of the looming threat of bankruptcy because Enron was one of the nation's leading companies and was heavily involved in national energy markets.   Lay wanted them to know so they could \"do anything they needed to,\" the spokesman said, adding that he didn't know when the calls were made.   Enron and Lay have been leading contributors to the President George W. Bush, as well as to a long list of Democratic and Republican candidates.   When asked if Lay had a personal connection to either Evans or O'Neill, the spokesman said he \"had no idea.\"   Prior to his appointment as Commerce Secretary, Evans served as chief executive of Tom Brown Inc. (TMBR), a Denver natural gas company. A longtime friend of Bush, Evans also served as general chairman of his presidential campaign.   Meanwhile, O'Neill headed Alcoa Inc. (AA), a Pittsburgh aluminum company, prior to his appointment.   Bush Thursday called for two working groups from his cabinet and other agencies to review matters related to events at Enron. The investigations would be in addition to the criminal investigation launched by the Department of Justice.   One group, from the Labor, Commerce and Treasury Departments, will look into Enron's pension rules and regulations. Another group, drawing from the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Commodities Futures and Trading Commission, will investigate corporate disclosure rules and regulations.   -By Christina Cheddar, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5166; christina.cheddar@dowjones.com    .....................................................................................................................................     US O'Neill Focuses On Regulatory Reform In Enron Review    01/11/2002  Dow Jones Capital Markets Report   (Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)     (This article was originally published Thursday)     NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said Thursday that he would focus on regulatory reform as part of President George W. Bush's newly announced probe of Enron Co. (ENE).  O'Neill told Fox News Channel that he would be part of two task forces stemming from the issue.   In the first, he would join Commerce Secretary Don Evans and Labor Secretary Elaine Chao to look at the impact of recent corporate bankruptcies on pension benefits.   In the second, he would join Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, Commodities Futures and Trading Commission Chairman James E. Newsome and Securities and Exchange Chairman Harvey Pitt in looking into disclosure rules. O'Neill said they will determine whether changes are needed \"to assure that investors and markets have all the information they are entitled to have to make our free-market economy work properly.\"   In ordering the probe, Bush particularly pointed at the loss of pension benefits by employees at Enron, which filed for bankruptcy last month. As Enron's stock collapsed, employees were barred from selling the company's shares while the energy trading company was changing pension administrators and the accounts were frozen.   Asked for specific solutions, O'Neill suggested that the government needed to see if 401(k) and other pension accounts need to be locked up when new administrators come in.   \"We need to look at that and see if that is a sensible thing to do,\" he said.   But beyond that, the Treasury secretary refused to be pinned down on possible remedies. \"I think we need to do a study and we need to do analysis,\" he said.   \"We need to do analysis before we do prescription. It's a pretty good idea to figure out what disease exists before we start cutting off arms and legs,\" he added.   O'Neill also stressed that this effort is motivated by Bush's concern for Enron's employees. The Treasury secretary said the president is \"just hurting a lot for people who apparently accumulated all of their savings in a 401(k) plan and then lost it all in a couple of months.\" -By Paul Rekoff, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4370;  paul.rekoff@dowjones.com    .....................................................................................................................................

SCHILIT: Well, again, I`m an accountant by training, not an attorney. But the role of the auditor is to raise assurance amongst investors in the competence of the company. And auditors more than any other profession, understands the importance of documentary evidence, and the work papers are an essential part of that.   MARCHINI: So, what you`re saying here is that it`s suspicious, they should have known better than to do this?   SCHILIT: Oh, I think this is a very serious situation, which certainly is going to be investigated very closely.   MARCHINI: Is there any precedent for the destruction of documents in a case like this, where an audit is being questioned?   SCHILIT: I have never heard of any situation where work papers have been destroyed. Very often when there had been frauds. And there have been very major frauds in the last few years. (INAUDIBLE), for example, in order to piece together what happened, there were years of documents. And in the case of Enron, it`s going to simply make the investigation much more difficult.   MARCHINI: Make the investigation much more difficult for both the criminal, the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission, I presume?   SCHILIT: That`s right.   MARCHINI: What are the potential penalties for Arthur Anderson, if it turns out they have broken the law?   SCHILIT: Again, that`s more of a legal question. In the case of past investigations by the SEC, and Arthur Anderson in particular has had several of those recently. One with Waste Management (URL: http://www.wastemanagement.com/) . The other with Sunbeam (URL: http://www.sunbeam.com/) . There are monetary penalties and it could be very substantial.   The Securities and Exchange Commission may not permit this auditing firm to take on any new clients. So it could be very substantial. Monetary and certainly individuals involved who may have been obstructing justice, there certainly can be criminal penalties.   MARCHINI: What are the ramifications for Arthur Anderson`s business? You mentioned the prospect that they might be barred from not taking on any new auditing clients for awhile, if it turns out there`s a criminal violation. But, they also run a rather large management consulting business. And I wonder what this does to their ability to win business now in the free markets?   SCHILIT: I`m sure it`s very difficult out there. Again, you probably want to speak to people at the company, to find out what their business wins (INAUDIBLE) have been. But I`d be very surprised if this were not a very difficult period for them to keep, and win new accounts.   MARCHINI: Understood.

O'Neill: Enron Situation `Just Another Piece Of Business'    01/11/2002  Dow Jones International News   (Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)     NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said Friday that the Enron (ENE) situation was \"just another piece of business\" to him when the company's chief executive talked to him about its difficulties.   In an interview on ABC's \"Good Morning America,\" O'Neill said it was \"quite appropriate\" for Enron chief executive Kennethy Lay to talk to him Oct. 28 and \"give me a heads-up\" about its difficulties.  O'Neill said Lay had alerted him to Enron's difficulties to make sure that capital markets weren't disrupted.   The Treasury secretary said \"he never asked me to help him at all.\" O'Neill said Lay hadn't told him that Enron had overstated its profits and he hadn't heard anything from Lay that he hadn't already read in newspapers or seen on television.   O'Neill said he hadn't then told President George W. Bush about the conversation because Bush was busy with the war on terrorism.   The Treasury secretary said \"I'm a cabinet secretary. I know what my responsibilities are\" and he doesn't have to run across the street to the president all the time.   O'Neill said Enron may be important but this \"was just another piece of business.\" O'Neill said he was also busy with the financial war on terrorism.   The Treasury secretary said it looks as if Enron was operating within the existing rules for 401K plans and if that was the case then the government will have to see if changes should be made in the rules. He said Bush doesn't want employees' 401K plans harmed by such situations.    .....................................................................................................................................     O'Neill says Enron pension policies appear to have stayed within rules    01/11/2002  AFX News   (c) 2002 by AFP-Extel News Ltd     WASHINGTON (AFX) - Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said it appears Enron Corp was within the rules in managing its corporate pension affairs.   \"At first blush it looks like Enron operated within the rules and regulations that existed, and still exist today with regard to how they managed their 401(k) plan,\" O'Neill said in an interview on ABC's Good Morning America.  O'Neill was addressing allegations that top corporate executives were able to cash out of stock while most employees' corporate pensions held as fixed, untradeable investments in Enron stock.   He noted he has been tasked by President George Bush to look at possible reforms of the corporate pension system, which currently allows companies to limit sales of company stock held within the funds, to prevent further cases like Enron, where many employees lost most of their personal savings.   Yesterday, O'Neill said employees should ultimately be able to make decisions on their corporate pension investments, and should have a choice of assets to invest in.   cxa/jad    .....................................................................................................................................     Business  Enron's Auditor Says It Destroyed Documents Related to Case  Jack Cafferty, Brooks Jackson    01/11/2002  American Morning with Paula Zahn   (c) Copyright eMediaMillWorks, Inc. (f/k/a Federal Document Clearing House, Inc.). All Rights Reserved.     Enron's auditor says it destroyed documents related to the case. The attorney general, John Ashcroft, says he can't take part in the investigation.   JACK CAFFERTY, CNN ANCHOR: Let's go back to the story of Enron for a moment. The \"Wall Street Journal\" this morning, they have said it best -- quote -- \"The storm cloud hanging over Enron and its long-time auditor, Arthur Andersen, just got darker\" -- unquote.  The company's auditor says it destroyed documents related to the case. The attorney general, John Ashcroft, says he can't take part in the investigation. He has a conflict of interest. Enron executives talked to two members of the president's cabinet just before the company collapsed.   CNN's senior correspondent Brooks Jackson joins us now from Washington with a detailed look at the timeline of the fall of an energy giant -- Brooks, good to have you with us.   BROOKS JACKSON, CNN SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Jack. Yes, those developments, just a flurry of them here in the last 24 hours. You mentioned the Arthur Andersen destruction of documents. Potentially the most serious new development, the Securities and Exchange Commission took the unusual step of saying they consider this extremely serious. And, boy, are they right, because if any of those documents were destroyed after investigations began, it could be criminal obstruction of justice.   As for Attorney General John Ashcroft's stepping aside, Democrats are saying he did the right thing in doing that. He got something like $57,000 in campaign contributions from Enron for his senate campaign, before he was attorney general. Also, many attorneys in the U.S. Attorney's Office in Houston are stepping aside. A lot of them have family ties to Enron executives and Enron employees. That's, of course, where Enron is headquartered. Some of the family members even lost money in 401Ks down there. So it's -- the Justice Department is still sorting out exactly who is going to be conducting this criminal investigation.   Those contacts with the White House -- or rather with the Bush administration are interesting. Secretary O'Neill got two calls from Ken Lay, the Enron chairman. O'Neill says those were just informational calls. He wasn't asked for any help. But Commerce Secretary Don Evans is saying that he was told by Lay that Lay would welcome any help in preserving Enron's bond rating with Moody's. Now -- and Lay's attorney is saying that he didn't ask for help. In any case, no help was forthcoming, and the White House says they weren't informed of this and that Lay and -- or excuse me -- that O'Neill and Don Evans did the right thing.   Latest development today: 51 subpoenas are going out from the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the U.S. Senate. Lay will get a subpoena. Other Enron and Arthur Andersen officials will get a subpoena, all of the board members for the last several years of Enron, including -- and this is very unusual -- wife of U.S. Senator Phil Gramm -- Wendy Gramm, who was on the board and on the audit committee of Enron -- Jack.   CAFFERTY: Unbelievable. And of course, lost in all of this discussion -- not yours and mine -- but in the discussion about Enron in general is the fact that so many small investors and employees of the company lost their life savings.   Brooks, we've got to move along. I thank you for that report very much -- Brooks Jackson joining us from Washington.

All Rights Reserved.     Failing energy giant Enron's chairman is a long-time major contributor to President Bush's career and to the Republican party. Adding to all of that, the company's accounting firm has revealed its employees destroyed documents sought in the investigation.   CAROL COSTELLO, CNN ANCHOR: And now to the monster fallout from the collapse of energy giant, Enron. The White House admits Enron officials sought the administration's help last fall, shortly before the company collapsed. Enron's chairman is a long-time major contributor to President Bush's career and to the Republican party. And Attorney General John Ashcroft has disqualified himself from the criminal investigation of Enron because of campaign donations he received from the company.  Adding to all of that, the company's accounting firm has revealed its employees destroyed documents sought in the investigation. For details on that, here's CNN Financial News Correspondent Allan Chernoff.   (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)   ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNN FINANCIAL NEWS (voice-over): Four investigators from the House and Energy Commerce Committee arrived at Andersen offices in Houston yesterday to interview Enron auditors and collect documents. But they were told there's a problem. Thursday afternoon, Andersen admitted material was missing.   In recent months, individuals in the firm involved with the Enron engagement disposed of a significant but undetermined number of electronic and paper documents and correspondence relating to the Enron engagement. Potentially thousands of documents that were part of Enron audits, according to the House Committee. Most of them, electronic, that were deleted in September, October and November, the three months prior to Enron's bankruptcy filing.   FRANKLIN VELIE, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: This is a surprising, though, and very disappointing development. You would not ordinarily expect a major loss of documents by an accounting or auditing firm with respect to the affairs of its -- of its client.   CHERNOFF: Securities and Exchange Commission Enforcement Chief Stephen Cutler said, \"Destruction of documents is an extremely serious matter,\" which he pledged, \"will be included within the scope of our investigation.\" As the company's auditor, Andersen had given a thumbs-up to Enron's financial statements. The SEC and Justice Department are investigating whether those very statements were used to hide Enron's financial condition from investors.   JOSEPH BERARDINO, CEO, ARTHUR ANDERSEN: If my firm has made errors in judgment, we will acknowledge them. We will make the changes needed to restore confidence.   CHERNOFF: Andersen has hired former Senator John Danforth to review the company's records management policy and ensure that remedial and disciplinary actions are taken.   (on camera): Next Wednesday, House investigators plan to meet with the Andersen partner in charge of the Enron audit. Said one committee staffer, \"We plan to hold his feet to the fire.\"   Allan Chernoff, CNN Financial News, New York.

Enron's Ken Lay says he only gave Washington a `headsup'  By PETE YOST  Associated Press Writer    01/11/2002  Associated Press Newswires   Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.     WASHINGTON (AP) - Transformed in just one day from the nation's biggest bankruptcy to a major political controversy, some of the players in the Enron affair are already giving conflicting versions of who said what to whom.   Did Enron's Ken Lay ask for help or didn't he when he called Commerce Secretary Don Evans, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan in a four-day span in late October?  If Lay didn't ask for anything, why did he call?   \"To give them a heads-up about the situation at Enron,\" company spokesman Mark Palmer said.   \"At no time did he ask for any assistance from the government nor did he intend to leave any impression that he was asking for assistance,\" said Palmer.   Evans's memory of his Oct. 29 phone call is that Lay said \"I would appreciate any support you could give.\"   \"I did nothing\" and the decision to do nothing \"was a no-brainer,\" Evans said in a brief interview Thursday with The Associated Press.   O'Neill insists Lay didn't ask for anything, but the context of their conversation is intriguing because the two men discussed another financial disaster in which Greenspan's intervention was very much in evidence, the near-failure in 1998 of a Connecticut-based hedge fund, Long Term Capital Management.   Greenspan's spokesman, Dave Skidmore, declined to say whether Lay asked for anything.   Evans said the context for the call from Lay was the ongoing review of Enron's financial status by Moody's, the bond-rating firm.   A severe lowering of Houston-based Enron's bond rating would mean that $3.9 billion in company debt would come due. Enron would have to pay what it owed in cash if it could not pay in stock, which was plummeting in value.   Palmer, the Enron spokesman, says he doesn't know whether the Moody's review was the subject of the Lay-Evans conversation but that the company was concerned because the bond-rating firm was taking a long time \"and we were wanting a decision.\"   In the end, Moody's dropped Enron's rating, creating still more trouble for the world's largest energy trader as it headed toward collapse. The company went to bankruptcy court on Dec. 2.   Lay spoke to Evans the day after a Sunday, Oct. 28, phone call with O'Neill and a phone call the previous Friday with Greenspan.   \"The chairman did nothing in response to the call. It would have been inappropriate,\" said Skidmore, the Greenspan spokesman.   Skidmore refused to discuss the contents of the Greenspan call, but in one of Lay's two conversations with O'Neill, the discussion turned to the case of the Connecticut hedge fund that had been in danger of failure until Greenspan and other Federal Reserve officials pressured several large financial institutions to bail it out.   Fed officials feared severe harm to the country's financial system if Long Term Capital Management had been allowed to crumble. It nearly tanked during the Asian financial crisis in the fall of 1998.   O'Neill \"expressed his concern about the experience that Long Term Capital went through when Long Term Capital went bankrupt,\" said White House spokesman Ari Fleischer.   In an interview with CNBC, O'Neill said that after one of their conversations, \"I subsequently asked the undersecretary of the Treasury to speak with the Enron people, which he did, so we could satisfy ourselves that the Enron affairs were not going to have a negative impact on the U.S. capital markets.\"   So why did Lay make the flurry of calls if he didn't want anything?   He \"just felt an obligation to give them information important to the markets and perhaps to the government,\" said Palmer.   While the information may have been important, the only action resulting from it appears to have been a decision by the two Cabinet secretaries not to tell President Bush. With Lay at the helm, Enron and its executives had been George W. Bush's most generous campaign donors over the course of two Texas governor's races and the presidential campaign.   When did Bush find out of the conversations between Lay, Evans and O'Neill?   \"This morning,\" Fleischer said Thursday.   ---   AP business writer Brad Foss in New York contributed to this story.    .....................................................................................................................................     Revelations about Enron, dealings with Bush officials, raise prickly questions  By MARCY GORDON  AP Business Writer    01/11/2002  Associated Press Newswires   Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.     WASHINGTON (AP) - A cascade of revelations about the bankrupt Enron Corp. and its dealings with Bush administration officials is raising questions about potential conflicts of interest as the Justice Department investigates the politically connected company.   The White House revealed Thursday that Enron officials sought the administration's help last fall shortly before the energy-trading company melted down along with the life savings of many of its employees. Several administration officials - and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan - received telephone calls from the Enron chairman, Kenneth Lay.  Enron's auditing firm, whose work is under investigation by federal regulators, disclosed that its employees had destroyed a \"significant\" number of documents - which a congressional source said was thousands of pages - related to Houston-based Enron.   In another startling development in a day brimming with them, Attorney General John Ashcroft disqualified himself from Justice's criminal inquiry into Enron's conduct. The energy-trading company donated thousands of dollars to Ashcroft's Senate campaign in 2000. In Houston, Enron's hometown, U.S. Attorney Michael Shelby announced that his entire office disqualified itself from the investigation because he and other local prosecutors \"have family relationships with individuals who are arguably affected by the Enron bankruptcy.\"   Bush, who counts Enron among his biggest political contributors, pledged to pursue aggressively the investigation into whether the company defrauded investors, including 401(k) plan holders, by concealing vital information about its finances.   \"Ken Lay is a supporter,\" the president said. \"But what anybody's going to find is that this administration will fully investigate issues, such as the Enron bankruptcy, to make sure we can learn from the past and make sure that workers are protected.\"   Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said Friday: \"On first blush it looks like Enron operated within the rules and regulations ... with regard to how they managed their 401(k) plan, and if they did, then we need to look and see if there are appropriate changes we could make.\" He was interviewed on ABC's \"Good Morning America.\"   Bush said he saw Lay twice last year, but they did not discuss Enron's financial problems. Lay sought help last fall from Commerce Secretary Don Evans, Bush's chief political fund-raiser and confidant, and contacted O'Neill about the firm's financial problems, O'Neill and Evans said Thursday. Enron also revealed that Lay called Greenspan, the independent Fed chairman, about the company's problems.   Lay denied that he sought help from the officials. Enron said Lay's calls to O'Neill, Evans and Greenspan were simply to give them a \"heads-up\" about Enron's problems.   \"He felt an obligation to let them know what was going on,\" Enron said in a statement. \"At no time did he ask for any assistance from the government, nor did he intend to leave the impression that he was asking for assistance.\"   Dave Skidmore, a spokesman for the Federal Reserve, said Lay contacted Greenspan on Oct. 26, and \"the chairman did nothing in response to the call. It would have been inappropriate.\" Skidmore would not characterize the conversation. Lay also first reached out to Evans on Oct. 26. The two eventually spoke three days later. The first of Lay's two conversations with O'Neill was Sunday, Oct. 28.   Enron's bankruptcy, already the subject of criminal, civil and congressional investigations, threatens to pull the White House into a political quagmire even as Bush's approval ratings reach near-record levels because of the war against terror.   \"It is now clear the White House had knowledge that Enron was likely to collapse but did nothing to try to protect innocent employees and shareholders who ultimately lost their life savings,\" said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif.   Firing back, Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer urged Democrats to avoid \"partisan witch hunts, endless investigations or fishing expeditions.\" Democrats hope to make a political issue out of the administration's many ties to Enron.   The bankruptcy has forced White House officials to face questions once posed to the scandal-tainted Clinton White House.   Would Bush support naming a special prosecutor to investigate? Fleischer said no. He also said he did not know any White House aides who had hired lawyers.   And there was a development reminiscent of Clinton's Whitewater: missing documents.   The big accounting firm that audited Enron's books, Arthur Andersen LLP, notified investigators that it had destroyed a \"significant\" number of documents related to the company. Andersen said it didn't know whether its directive to preserve documents demanded by government investigators was violated.   At the Securities and Exchange Commission, already investigating Andersen's auditing work for Enron, Enforcement Director Stephen Cutler said destruction of documents was \"an extremely serious matter\" but would not deter the SEC from pursuing its probe.   As for the company's contacts last fall, administration officials said Lay told Evans on Oct. 29 that he would welcome any support to help the company deal with a bond-rating firm that was considering downgrading Enron. Enron's credit rating was critical because, if lowered, $3.9 billion in debt would come due. Of that amount, $2.4 billion previously had been hidden in partnerships that were created to keep debt off Enron's books.   In a brief interview, Evans said Lay told him: \"I would appreciate any support you could give.\" Evans said Lay was not more specific. In response to the plea, Evans said, \"I did nothing.\"   Evans said he didn't tell the president about the call because \"I didn't think he needed to know.\"   In one of two conversations with O'Neill, Lay discussed a past example in which the Federal Reserve pressured several large financial institutions to bail out a Connecticut hedge fund, Fleischer said.   The calls to Evans and O'Neill came after investors and the public learned of the extent of Enron's problems, when the company posted major losses Oct. 16.   Enron filed for bankruptcy Dec. 2, after months of conjecture about its finances.   Other Enron-Bush administration ties:   -Bush raised nearly $114,000 in political action committee money and individual donations from Enron during the presidential campaign. Enron also gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to Bush's two gubernatorial campaigns in Texas. Independent analyses show that Enron employees donated almost $800,000 from 1999 to 2001 to Bush, members of Congress and both parties. Most went to GOP causes.   -Lay met with Vice President Dick Cheney or his aides six times last year before release of the administration's energy plan. A Cheney spokeswoman said he last talked with Lay in June, and never about Enron's financial status.   -Senior Bush adviser Karl Rove owned Enron stock at the beginning of Bush's term but sold it because of federal ethics rules. Economics adviser Larry Lindsey earned $50,000 from Enron for serving on a company board last year.   -Marc Racicot, whom Bush has appointed chairman of the Republican National Committee, was a lobbyist for Enron last year. Racicot said he will do no more lobbying work after he takes the GOP's top job.

Recycling plant defends Enron deal following criticism by Senate leader  By STEPHEN SINGER  Associated Press Writer    01/11/2002  Associated Press Newswires   Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.     HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The head of a quasi-public, statewide trash authority is defending the agency's $220 million deal with the now-bankrupt Enron Corp., following stepped-up criticism by a state Senate leader.   The Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority held a news conference Thursday to rebut comments by Senate Majority Leader George Jepsen, D-Stamford, a candidate for the Democratic nomination for governor.  CRRA President Robert E. Wright said the agency did nothing wrong in the energy distribution deal with the Houston-based energy giant that declared bankruptcy last month.   \"There's no information that will show it was anything but a very, very good deal for CRRA,\" Wright said. \"I thought we had discussed this with him, but if Senator Jepsen wants it explained again, it will be explained again.\"   Jepsen, who first questioned the CRRA-Enron relationship last month, called a news conference at his Capitol office Thursday to repeat his criticism.   \"It's incomprehensible to me they put all their eggs in one basket,\" Jepsen said.   Jepsen has questioned why the state made a $220 million upfront, lump-sum payment in the deal with Enron. The company formed in 1985 and grew into the nation's seventh-biggest company in revenue by buying electricity from generators and selling it to consumers.   Enron's collapse will force CRRA to raise by as much as 60 percent the cost charged to towns to dispose of trash, Jepsen said.   Wright disputed Jepsen's cost estimate. \"I can't see that under any circumstances,\" he said.   Jepsen has called the CRRA-Enron deal the largest loss of public money in Connecticut history. State Attorney General Richard Blumenthal is investigating.   The U.S. Justice Department said Wednesday it had begun a criminal investigation of Enron Corp.   In Connecticut, United Illuminating Co. announced last week it replaced Enron as the utility's energy supplier, signing a $600 million power supply agreement with Dominion Resources.   CRRA, which accepts recyclable trash from 70 towns, struck a good deal with Enron for the use of a 90-acre site in Hartford, Wright said. The site includes a trash-to-energy plant.   The deal with Enron was part of a complex transaction that also involved Connecticut Light & Power Co., which owned the 90-acre site in Hartford's South Meadows area.   Under the state's electricity deregulation law, CL&P was mandated to divest all its power-generating assets, including the South Meadows property.   To divest, CL&P had to buy its way out of a contract to buy steam power from CRRA. That contract had 11 years left. The buy-out price was $280 million.   Using state bond funds given to power companies to help them buy out of contracts and divest holdings under deregulation, CL&P sent $220 million to Enron and $60 million to CRRA.   The money given to Enron was payment for the company taking over the obligations of the steam purchasing contract with CRRA that CL&P relinquished.   CRRA used part of its $60 million to buy the 90-acre site, clean pollution from the site and insure the property.   Wright, responding to Jepsen's criticism that CRRA made a mistake by failing to require Enron to post collateral or other security, said such a practice does not exist in the industry.   He refused to rule out the possibility that CRRA will seek a bailout from the state.   \"We'd be crazy to say no to anything,\" he said.   Dean Pagani, a spokesman for Gov. John Rowland, said the governor is not worried that CRRA's financial loss will jeopardize the state's finances.   \"He's confident that CRRA has a plan to work its way out of this situation,\" he said.   The recycling agency is politically well connected. Its chairman, Peter Ellef, is co-chief of staff for the Republican governor. Rep. Brian J. Flaherty, R-Watertown, is a spokesman for the agency and Sen. Thomas Gaffey, D-Meriden, heads the agency's recycling, environmental and education division.   Wright said the episode is the result of deregulation and a new competitive energy market.   \"You can't force a utility to take back an energy contract,\" he said.    .....................................................................................................................................

Wright said the agency did nothing wrong in the energy distribution deal with the Houston-based energy giant that declared bankruptcy last month.   \"There's no information that will show it was anything but a very, very good deal for CRRA,\" Wright said. \"I thought we had discussed this with him, but if Senator Jepsen wants it explained again, it will be explained again.\"   Jepsen, who first questioned the CRRA-Enron relationship last month, called a news conference at his Capitol office Thursday to repeat his criticism.   \"It's incomprehensible to me they put all their eggs in one basket,\" Jepsen said.   Jepsen has questioned why the state made a $220 million upfront, lump-sum payment in the deal with Enron. The company formed in 1985 and grew into the nation's seventh-biggest company in revenue by buying electricity from generators and selling it to consumers.   Enron's collapse will force CRRA to raise by as much as 60 percent the cost charged to towns to dispose of trash, Jepsen said.   Wright disputed Jepsen's cost estimate. \"I can't see that under any circumstances,\" he said.   Jepsen has called the CRRA-Enron deal the largest loss of public money in Connecticut history. State Attorney General Richard Blumenthal is investigating.   The U.S. Justice Department said Wednesday it had begun a criminal investigation of Enron Corp.   In Connecticut, United Illuminating Co. announced last week it replaced Enron as the utility's energy supplier, signing a $600 million power supply agreement with Dominion Resources.   CRRA, which accepts recyclable trash from 70 towns, struck a good deal with Enron for the use of a 90-acre site in Hartford, Wright said. The site includes a trash-to-energy plant.   The deal with Enron was part of a complex transaction that also involved Connecticut Light & Power Co., which owned the 90-acre site in Hartford's South Meadows area.   Under the state's electricity deregulation law, CL&P was mandated to divest all its power-generating assets, including the South Meadows property.   To divest, CL&P had to buy its way out of a contract to buy steam power from CRRA. That contract had 11 years left. The buy-out price was $280 million.   Using state bond funds given to power companies to help them buy out of contracts and divest holdings under deregulation, CL&P sent $220 million to Enron and $60 million to CRRA.   The money given to Enron was payment for the company taking over the obligations of the steam purchasing contract with CRRA that CL&P relinquished.   CRRA used part of its $60 million to buy the 90-acre site, clean pollution from the site and insure the property.   Wright, responding to Jepsen's criticism that CRRA made a mistake by failing to require Enron to post collateral or other security, said such a practice does not exist in the industry.   He refused to rule out the possibility that CRRA will seek a bailout from the state.   \"We'd be crazy to say no to anything,\" he said.   Dean Pagani, a spokesman for Gov. John Rowland, said the governor is not worried that CRRA's financial loss will jeopardize the state's finances.   \"He's confident that CRRA has a plan to work its way out of this situation,\" he said.   The recycling agency is politically well connected. Its chairman, Peter Ellef, is co-chief of staff for the Republican governor. Rep. Brian J. Flaherty, R-Watertown, is a spokesman for the agency and Sen. Thomas Gaffey, D-Meriden, heads the agency's recycling, environmental and education division.   Wright said the episode is the result of deregulation and a new competitive energy market.   \"You can't force a utility to take back an energy contract,\" he said.    .....................................................................................................................................     Financial Post: Canada  Enron Canada 'critical' to auction in U.S.: Unit remains solvent: Part of package to sell trading business, Milnthorp says  Claudia Cattaneo, Calgary Bureau Chief  Financial Post; with files from Bloomberg News    01/11/2002  National Post   National  FP4  (c) National Post 2002. All Rights Reserved.     CALGARY - Enron Canada Corp. cut half its staff and halted its trading operations while waiting for an auction in the United States that could yield a buyer today for Enron's trading business, the president and chief executive of the Canadian unit said yesterday.   Robson Milnthorp said the Canadian arm will be \"critical\" to a deal to sell Enron Corp.'s trading business because it has been the most profitable in the company.  The unit remains solvent, with more than $220-million in cash and more than $100-million owed by counterparties -- partners with whom it has contracts -- that are refusing to honour their obligations, he said in an interview.   If there's no bid for the Canadian operation, Enron Canada will look for a white knight of its own, he said.   \"We have been very careful not to jeopardize the efforts made on Houston's part with respect to the [auction]. But if that was to fall through, Canada would attempt to find its own white knight, so to speak. We had numerous expressions of interest and none of those have been pursued at this time.\"   Houston-based Enron Corp. was negotiating yesterday with at least six potential buyers for its wholesale trading business in an auction that was part of efforts to reorganize itself under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The auction was expected to continue into the evening.   In Manhattan, U.S. bankruptcy judge Arthur J. Gonzalez scheduled a hearing for today to approve the sale.   Enron Canada was Canada's largest market maker of natural gas and power until it was swept up in the failure of its indirect parent, which unraveled after disclosures that Enron Corp. had shifted billions of dollars in debt off its books. It was left saddled with at least US$40-billion in debt.   Enron Corp.'s troubles deepened this week with revelations that the U.S. Justice Department has begun a criminal investigation. There was also an admission yesterday by the firm that audited Enron's books, Arthur Andersen LLP, that a \"significant but undetermined\" number of documents related to the company had been destroyed.   Mr. Milnthorp said the investigation \"has nothing to do with Enron Canada.\"   The Canadian unit attempted last month to distance itself from the parent and re-emerge as an independent company but gave up after losing a bid in an Alberta court to keep counterparties from unwinding contracts, its major asset.   Mr. Milnthorp said the Canadian arm was packaged as part of a deal to sell Enron's overall trading business, which buys and sells oil, petroleum products, natural gas, electricity, metals, coal, forest products and steel, and a variety of contracts and derivatives. The company would get cash and a 49% stake in a new partnership called \"Netco,\" short for New Energy Trading Company, under the proposed sale. The trading unit generated about 90% of Enron Corp.'s US$100.8- billion in revenue in 2000.   Mr. Milnthorp said 75 employees in Calgary and Toronto were laid off after last month's court proceedings and trading was suspended because of lack of confidence in the market.   \"To be successful in this business, you need a very solid balance sheet that creates the confidence necessary to enter into long-term transactions. That's been one of the key criteria through the auction process,\" he said.   Enron Canada's remaining employees are \"trying to manage the estate and trying to work hard to co-operate with our customers to get them paid,\" he said.   The unit is cash rich from the sale last month of its interest in the Sundance B power-generating plant outside of Edmonton.   Bidders for all or parts of the trading operation include Citigroup Inc., the largest financial services company, UBS AG, the largest Swiss bank, and BP PLC, one of the largest oil and gas companies.    .....................................................................................................................................     World  Enron files destroyed, auditor says: White House tries to insulate Bush from growing scandal  Jan Cienski  National Post    01/11/2002  National Post   National  A14  (c) National Post 2002. All Rights Reserved.     WASHINGTON - The White House moved quickly yesterday to contain growing questions about the collapse of energy trader Enron, hoping to insulate George W. Bush, the U.S. President and former oil executive, from any political fallout from the scandal.   Seeking to get out in front of the story, the White House yesterday acknowledged that senior administration officials received calls for help from Enron as the company went into a death spiral that ended with its bankruptcy on Dec. 2.  Mr. Bush called Enron's fall \"deeply troubling\" and ordered Paul O'Neill, his Treasury Secretary, to review U.S. pension and disclosure rules to prevent a repeat of the Enron situation, in which employees' pensions were destroyed as the company fell.   Among a series of other developments, John Ashcroft, the U.S. Attorney-General, recused himself from the criminal probe into the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history because Enron had given him US$25,000 for his failed bid last year to keep his U.S. Senate seat.   Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, disclosed that a significant number of documents and electronic files related to Enron had been destroyed.   Enron, once the seventh-largest company in the United States and its largest energy trader, was ruined when the company announced on Nov. 8 it had overstated earnings by US$638-million from 1997 to 2000. The company's share price fell from more than US$90 to less than a dollar, wiping out the retirement savings of about 20,000 employees who were forbidden to sell their holdings.   Meanwhile, many of the company's senior directors, including Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, became fabulously wealthy when they cashed in large chunks of their shares before the stock price cratered.   Houston-based Enron and its executives have been the largest political donors during Mr. Bush's political career, giving him more than US$623,000, according to the Center for Public Integrity.   Almost US$2-million more was given to the two leading political parties, although Republicans got 73% of the total.   Enron has ties to Republicans such as Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, whose wife, Wendy, is a company director, Tom DeLay, the House majority whip, and Dick Armey, the House majority leader.   Mr. Bush's senior advisor, Karl Rove, came under fire last year for not selling his Enron shares quickly enough under federal conflict of interest guidelines.   Mr. Lay met six times with Dick Cheney, the Vice-President, when he was putting together Mr. Bush's national energy policy.   Despite Enron's links to Washington, there has been no evidence it received special favours.   \"Ken Lay is a supporter,\" Mr. Bush said yesterday. \"But what anybody's going to find is that this administration will fully investigate issues, such as the Enron bankruptcy, to make sure we can learn from the past and make sure that workers are protected.\"   The President said he had never discussed Enron's situation with Mr. Lay and said the last time he had seen the disgraced executive was in Houston last spring.   The U.S. Justice Department has launched a criminal probe and the Department of Labor is investigating the firm, as are four committees from both the U.S. Senate and the House.   Nonetheless, the Enron quagmire is threatening to suck in Mr. Bush, who has enjoyed near-record popularity ratings because of his wartime leadership.   \"It's now clear the White House had knowledge that Enron was likely to collapse but did nothing to try to protect innocent employees and shareholders who ultimately lost their life savings,\" said Henry Waxman, a Democratic congressman from California.   Mr. Bush's press secretary warned Democrats against \"partisan witch hunts, endless investigations or fishing expeditions.\"   Ari Fleischer said Mr. O'Neill and Don Evans, the Commerce Secretary, had both been contacted by Mr. Lay as his company began to go under. Both men agreed to take no action to intervene and protect the company's bondholders and Mr. Bush was not notified of the phone calls, Mr. Fleischer said, rejecting the suggestion that the President had intentionally been kept \"out of the loop.\"   Enron closed yesterday at 67 cents, down 12 cents on the New York Stock Exchange.    .....................................................................................................................................     City - Andersen check on Enron pulp.  By Simon English.    01/11/2002  The Daily Telegraph   P33  (c) Telegraph Group Limited, London, 2002     in New York   ARTHUR Andersen, auditors to Enron, admitted last night it destroyed thousands of internal documents in the run-up to the disgraced energy company's $70 billion collapse and could now face prosecution.  It told US lawmakers and watchdogs that staff had \"disposed of a significant\" amount of paperwork relating to its work for Enron, for which it was paid more than $1m a week.   This includes emails and documents requested by the US Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission as their investigation into America's biggest ever bankruptcy gains momentum.   Andersen is ordering an inquiry into the shredding party, which occurred \"in recent months\", according to the accountancy firm.   Senator Billy Tauzin, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said: \"Anyone that destroys records to try to subvert our investigation should be prosecuted.\"   Michael Donovan, a Philadelphia lawyer who is mounting a class action lawsuit against Andersen on behalf of investors was shocked. \"Auditors save everything,\" he said.   Last month, Andersen's chief executive Joe Berardino turned on his biggest client, accusing Enron of withholding key financial information that made doing a proper audit on the business impossible.   He also admitted that Andersen, one of the biggest accountancy firms in the world, had made \"honest errors\" in its assessment of Enron's financial strength.   As embarrassment mounts for George Bush because of his close links to Enron and friendship with chairman Kenneth Lay, the President ordered a review of US pension laws.   More than 20,000 employees saw their pension funds, often largely invested in Enron shares, devastated by the company's plunge into bankruptcy.   \"In light of the most recent bankruptcy, there needs to be a full review of disclosure rules to make sure that the American stockholder is protected,\" said Mr Bush.    .....................................................................................................................................     News Business  Enron scandal reaches White House  BARRIE McKENNA  With a report from Lily Nguyen in Calgary    01/11/2002  The Globe and Mail   Metro  A1  \"All material Copyright (c) Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc. and its licensors. All rights reserved.\"     WASHINGTON -- Reports of missing Enron Corp. documents and secret White House meetings have deepened the political intrigue surrounding the launch of a criminal probe into the largest corporate failure in U.S. history.   The Bush administration scrambled yesterday to distance itself from the Enron debacle as the collapsed company's auditors disclosed that key documents have gone missing and White House officials confirmed the company unsuccessfully sought an 11th-hour rescue.  The case is already drawing comparisons to the Whitewater scandal, which dogged former president Bill Clinton and triggered a $50-million (U.S.) investigation by a special counsel into the failed Arkansas real-estate venture.   Enron's legal and financial problems have also raised questions whether the Bush administration can conduct an objective investigation into one of its largest and most loyal political contributors.   Late last year and with the Houston-based company teetering on the brink of failure, chairman Kenneth Lay -- a key campaign donor to President George W. Bush and other top Republicans -- talked to Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Donald Evans about a possible rescue, the White House disclosed yesterday. U.S. Vice-President Dick Cheney has acknowledged he met with top Enron officials a half-dozen times last year as he was preparing the Bush administration's energy policy.   Mr. Lay's appeals were rejected, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer told reporters.   Meanwhile, the accounting firm that audited Enron's books, Arthur Andersen LLP, disclosed yesterday that some of its employees destroyed a \"significant but undetermined\" number of paper and electronic documents related to the company.   Officials at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which is also probing the Enron bankruptcy, said Arthur Anderson's destruction of documents is an \"extremely serious matter.\"   Federal law-enforcement agencies and congressional investigators are seeking the documents as part of their inquiries into the bankruptcy of the giant energy-trading company. The destroyed documents include electronic files and other documents related to its audit of Enron. Also yesterday, Attorney-General John Ashcroft said he has stepped down from the criminal investigation launched by his department after acknowledging that he took a campaign donation from Enron during his failed 2001 U.S. Senate bid in Missouri.   Mr. Lay and Enron contributed a total of $57,499 to Mr. Ashcroft's campaign, according to the Washington-based Center for Public Integrity. The Justice Department insisted Mr. Ashcroft has taken the high road by stepping aside as the sweeping nationwide probe gets under way.   \"The Attorney-General has not been involved in any aspect of initiating or conducting any investigation involving Enron,\" the Justice Department said in a statement.   The investigation is being conducted by U.S. Attorneys in New York, Houston, San Francisco and elsewhere.   Mr. Bush, who received hundreds of thousands of dollars in contributions from Mr. Lay and other Enron executives for his presidential bid, pledged to get to the bottom of the stunning collapse.   \"What anybody's going to find out is that this administration will fully investigate issues such as the Enron bankruptcy, to make sure we can learn from the past and make sure workers are protected,\" Mr. Bush said, making his first public comments on the case.   Mr. Bush said he never discussed Enron's financial problems with Mr. Lay. The President said he last saw Mr. Lay in Texas at a spring fundraiser for a Barbara Bush (his mother) literary foundation.   The Enron chairman was also among a group of about 20 business leaders who came to the White House early in the Bush administration to discuss the state of the economy, Mr. Bush said.   Thousands of Enron employees lost their life savings when the company filed for bankruptcy Dec. 2.   Enron was the largest marketer of electricity and natural gas in the United States before a crisis of confidence among investors forced the company to file for bankruptcy protection in December. The company had a stock-market value of nearly $80-billion and more than $100-billion in sales last year, making it one of the largest companies in the world. But the empire started to unravel last October after Enron revealed a series of large and previously undisclosed debts to private partnerships, controlled by some of its own executives.   Since the 1989-90 election cycle, Enron and its employees have made $2.4-million in contributions to U.S. federal political campaigns, the bulk of that to Republicans. The Justice Department is believed to want to discover whether Enron executives intentionally misled investors about those transactions and the company's deteriorating financial condition.   The Justice probe isn't the only problem facing the company. The Securities and Exchange Commission launched its own investigation. The company is also facing probes by the U.S. Department of Labour, the House of Representatives and the Senate.   Meanwhile, creditors, clients and others caught in the Enron fallout continued to await the outcome of an auction of the company's trading empire.   Enron's bankruptcy lawyer, Martin Bienenstock of Weil Gotshal & Manges, told Bloomberg News Agency that there are six bidders vying for the trading assets in the private auction being held at the firm's New York offices. Published reports have named large financial services companies.   Citigroup Inc. and UBS AG are among the bidders for Enron's Canadian trading unit, Enron Canada Corp., which is also on the block.    .....................................................................................................................................     Business  Enron threatens to taint Bush --- Auditors say they destroyed many company papers  Ron Fournier  ASSOCIATED PRESS    01/11/2002  The Toronto Star   Ontario  E11  Copyright (c) 2002 The Toronto Star     The White House revealed yesterday that Enron Corp., an energy firm closely tied to U.S. President George W. Bush, sought the administration's help shortly before collapsing with the life savings of many workers. The company denied it sought such help.   In a separate disclosure, the company's auditors said they destroyed many Enron documents in the months before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission subpoenaed the firm.  In the rapid swirl of events, each raising questions about potential conflicts of interest, Attorney General John Ashcroft disqualified himself from the criminal inquiry into Enron's conduct. The company donated thousands of dollars to Ashcroft's Senate campaign in 2000.   Bush, who counts Enron as one of his biggest political contributors, pledged to aggressively pursue the investigation into whether the Texas-based firm defrauded investors, including pension contributors, by concealing vital information about its finances.   \"Ken Lay is a supporter,\" the president said of Enron chairman Kenneth Lay. \"But what anybody's going to find is that this administration will fully investigate issues, such as the Enron bankruptcy, to make sure we can learn from the past and make sure that workers are protected.\"   Enron's bankruptcy, already the subject of criminal, civil and congressional investigations, threatens to pull the White House into a political quagmire even as Bush's approval ratings reach near-record levels because of the war against terrorism.   \"It is now clear the White House had knowledge that Enron was likely to collapse but did nothing to try to protect innocent employees and shareholders who ultimately lost their life savings,\" said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif.   Firing back, Bush spokesperson Ari Fleischer urged Democrats to avoid \"partisan witch hunts, endless investigations or fishing expeditions.\"   Democrats hope to make a political issue out of the administration's many ties to Enron.   The bankruptcy has forced White House officials to face questions once posed to the scandal-tainted Clinton White House.   Would Bush support naming a special prosecutor to investigate? Fleischer said no. He also said he did not know any White House aides who had hired lawyers.   And there was a development reminiscent of Clinton's Whitewater affair: missing documents.   The firm that audited Enron's books, Arthur Andersen LLP, notified investigators that it had destroyed a \"significant but undetermined\" number of documents related to the company. After the Securities and Exchange Commission subpoenaed the accounting firm, it issued an instruction to preserve documents, it said.   As for Enron's contacts last fall, administration officials said U.S. Commerce Secretary Don Evans and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill received calls from Lay seeking help for his company.   Lay told Evans he would welcome any support in helping the company deal with a bond-rating firm that was considering downgrading Enron, administration officials said.   Enron's credit rating was critical because if it was lowered, $3.9 billion (U.S.) in debt would come due. Of that amount, $2.4 billion previously had been hidden in partnerships that were created to keep debt off Enron's books.   Evans quoted Lay as saying, \"I would appreciate any support you could give,\" and said Lay was not more specific. \"I did nothing,\" Evans said of his response to the plea. \"It was a no-brainer.\" Evans, one of Bush's oldest friends, said he didn't tell the president about the call. \"I didn't think he needed to know,\" he said.   In one of two conversations with O'Neill, Lay discussed a past example in which the U.S. Federal Reserve Board pressured several large financial institutions to bail out a Connecticut hedge fund.   Lay, for his part, said his calls to O'Neill and Evans were merely to give them a \"heads up\" about Enron's problems. \"He felt an obligation to let them know what was going on,\" Enron said in a statement. \"At no time did he ask for any assistance from the government nor did he intend to leave the impression that he was asking for assistance.\"   The calls came after investors and the general public learned of the extent of Enron's problems, when the company posted major losses Oct. 16.   Enron filed for bankruptcy Dec. 2, after months of speculation about its finances.   Administration officials dismissed suggestions that Evans or O'Neill should have disclosed Enron's troubles as soon as they were brought to their attention last fall. That might have given more notice to investors about to lose their savings.   \"This is not the first bankruptcy and will not be the last bankruptcy\" in America, Fleischer said.   Other aides said Enron's problems were well known at the time of the telephone calls, and the administration's duty was to make sure troubles at Enron didn't have a broader economic impact.   Bush raised nearly $114,000 in political action committee money and individual donations from Enron during the presidential campaign, making the company one of his biggest financial supporters. In addition, Enron gave tens of thousands of dollars to Bush's two gubernatorial campaigns in Texas.   Independent analysts show that Enron employees donated nearly $800,000 from 1999 to 2001 to Bush, members of Congress and both parties. The bulk went to GOP causes.   With criticism mounting, Bush announced a review of federal rules on pension security and financial disclosure by companies.   \"There have been a wave of bankruptcies that have caused many workers to lose their pensions and that's deeply troubling to me,\" Bush said. 'It is now clear the White House had knowledge that Enron was likely to collapse but did nothing to try to protect innocent employees and shareholders who ultimately lost their life savings.'   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif.    .....................................................................................................................................   Threat to Bush in Enron inquiry.  By Matthew Engel in Washington and David Teather in New York.    01/11/2002  The Guardian   P1  Copyright (C) 2002 The Guardian     President Bush moved rapidly yesterday to distance himself from the collapsed Enron Corporation as speculation grew that the bankruptcy of the giant energy trading company could turn into his administration's most dangerous scandal.   Hours after the justice department announced it was setting up a nationwide team of prosecutors as part of a criminal inquiry into Enron, the White House ordered a review of rules affecting pension rights and corporate disclosure. Mr Bush told reporters he had not seen Enron's chairman, Kenneth Lay, since last spring and had never discussed the company's financial problems with him.  Enron, the seventh ranked company on the Fortune 500, collapsed last month - the biggest bankruptcy in corporate history. About 6,000 workers were laid off, many also losing their pensions because they subscribed to a retirement plan based on Enron shares, which dropped from $90 ( #62) to pennies in a year. The list of creditors runs to 54 pages but senior executives were able to sell their stock before the price plummeted.   The company is believed to be the largest donor to Mr Bush's campaign funds over the course of his career, and Mr Lay is an old Texas friend of the president. He was named as one of the president's energy advisers last year.   The links between the administration and the company operate on many levels. Marc Racicot, Enron's Washington lobbyist, was named last week as chairman of the Republican national committee. The president's chief economic adviser, Lawrence Lindsay, and the trade negotiator Robert Zoellick were advisers to the company.   Vice-president Dick Cheney, who also has strong links with the oil industry, is known to have met Mr Lay in April to discuss energy policy. And staff from Mr Cheney's energy taskforce met Enron executives at least six times, with one meeting only six days before the company's troubles became public in October. The administration, however, insists that the meetings covered only policy matters and not Enron's financial position.   The White House spokesman, Ari Fleischer, was peppered with questions yesterday about whether Mr Bush and Mr Cheney were aware of the situation and if not, why not.   \"Conversation is routine between people in this country and government,\" he said at the daily briefing. \"There's a difference between corporate contact and wrongdoing.\"   Mr Fleischer said that Mr Lay called the treasury secretary, Paul O'Neill, and the commerce secretary, Don Evans, before the company's downfall to warn them. The two cabinet members \"agreed no action should be taken to intervene\".   Enron, whose interests extend to ownership of Wessex Water in Britain, is mainly in the business of creating markets between buyers and sellers of energy. The investigations already launched have highlighted the company's use of offshore entities, apparently to hide its debts.   A justice department investigation on this scale into a single entity is thought to be unprecedented, and officials said it was an indication of the case's potential significance.   Congressional Democrats, conscious of the efforts poured into the largely abortive investigation into Bill Clinton's property dealings at Whitewater, are beginning to crank up their own investigations.   \"Enron makes Whitewater look like peanuts,\" the syndicated columnist Bill Press said.   The affair has also called into question the role of energy and financial regulators in the US. And it has done nothing for the reputations of Wall Street analysts who advised clients to put money into the company.    .....................................................................................................................................     Business  Andersen back in hot seat ; Accounting giant says Enron audit papers destroyed  Delroy Alexander, Tribune staff writer    01/11/2002  Chicago Tribune   North Sports Final ; N  1  (Copyright 2002 by the Chicago Tribune)     A Chicago-based accounting giant that has faced significant embarrassments recently now may face unprecedented scrutiny.   Andersen took center stage in a potential scandal Thursday after disclosing that its employees had destroyed a \"significant\" number of documents related to the sudden collapse of Enron Corp.  For a company that has weathered damaging disclosures over its audits of Houston-based Waste Management Inc. and Sunbeam Corp., the latest brouhaha could be a further threat to credibility.   \"This is a deeply troubling development. It should never have happened,\" said Billy Tauzin (R-La.), whose House Energy and Commerce Committee is investigating Enron's collapse. \"Anyone who destroyed records simply out of stupidity should be fired; anyone who destroyed records intentionally to subvert our investigation should be prosecuted.\"   Observers said destruction of the files made no sense, and that the records might have provided clues for investigators probing the Enron case, the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history.   \"I have never in my life heard of people in an accounting firm doing something like this,\" said Lynn Turner, a former chief accountant for the Securities and Exchange Commission. \"People in these accounting firms are well-educated professionals and supposedly well aware of their professional responsibility to the public.\"   For its part, Andersen said in a statement that its company policy \"required in certain circumstances the destruction of certain types of documents.\" However, officials added that the firm is still \"working to gather the facts and determine appropriate disciplinary actions\" against employees.   Several observers suggested that the missing files likely were noticed only after the SEC issued subpoenas in mid-December calling for Andersen to hand over documents related to its Enron audits.   Andersen said the documents were discarded months before it received the subpoenas. \"After receiving the SEC subpoena, the firm issued an instruction to preserve documents. At this time, we have not been able to determine whether that instruction was violated,\" the firm said.   Andersen said that millions of Enron documents still exist and that it had successfully retrieved some of the deleted electronic files. It is continuing efforts to \"fully learn and understand all the facts related to this issue,\" according to the statement.   Auditors typically keep records for years, experts say. Most top accounting firms keep records for more than seven years after work is completed, in case of lawsuits.   It also is customary for audit firms to scan and file client documents at a central electronic database or warehouse, according to analysts. Once that is completed, original hard copies are often destroyed.   Policy suspended   Andersen said it had \"suspended its current records management policy effective immediately and instructed all partners and personnel to retain all existing documents until further notice.\"   Furthermore, Andersen said it has asked former U.S. Sen. John Danforth to review its policies and recommend potential improvements.   Andersen has been in the spotlight before for its audits.   In June, Andersen reached a $7 million settlement with the SEC in which it neither admitted nor denied allegations of fraud in its audit of Houston-based Waste Management Inc. Andersen and the waste hauler also paid $220 million in 1999 to settle class-action lawsuits relating to the case.   Last year, Andersen agreed to pay $110 million to settle class- action litigation brought on behalf of shareholders of another client, Sunbeam Corp., which had misstated its financial results during the 1990s.   However, the record payout for audit problems remains $335 million paid by Ernst & Young to Cendant Corp. shareholders in 1999.   Public concern over the veracity of audits has heightened since Enron's debacle, with regulators focusing on Andersen's performance.   The news is a blow not only to Andersen, but also to the profession, which said it would come up with new rules to help regulate itself after Enron's problems emerged.   Just last week, the self-regulatory process was called into question after rival Big Five firm Deloitte & Touche gave Andersen's auditing practice a clean bill of health.   Problems for claim   The news may also present problems for Andersen's claim that it was misled by Enron executives, experts said.   In mid-December, Andersen's chief executive, Joseph Berardino, told the first congressional hearing into the collapse that it warned Enron about \"possible illegal acts,\" saying the energy-trading giant withheld crucial data about its complex finances.   Some observers warned that the credibility of that claim may now have been damaged as a result of the missing documents.   \"Essentially, they've already claimed that management committed a fraud on them,\" said Mark Cheffers, a former PriceWaterhouse auditor who now runs AccountingMalpractice.com, a liability training Web site that caters to 20,000 accountants.   \"Evidence that documents have been destroyed that relate to the very events that are under investigation represents a terrible blow for the defense that management misled them,\" he added.    .....................................................................................................................................     Business  Andersen gap starts shredding trust all around  David Greising    01/11/2002  Chicago Tribune   North Sports Final ; N  1  (Copyright 2002 by the Chicago Tribune)     Now the Enron debacle has its own 18 1/2-minute gap.   The famous gap arose during the Watergate investigation when part of a troublesome Richard Nixon conversation was \"accidentally\" erased from a White House tape.  Enron's auditor, Chicago-based Andersen, disclosed its own smelly blank space Thursday. Andersen employees created a huge gap when they destroyed thousands of files that arose from Andersen's Enron audits.   File shredders and computer delete keys went into overdrive from September to November of last year. Strange coincidence. That's the period of Enron's straight-line depreciation from world's largest energy trader to nation's largest bankruptcy.   Think the Watergate comparison overreaches? Well, I doubt a president will fall because of it. Shredded documents at an accounting firm hardly mean scandal will reach the oval office.   As scandals go, this looks more like a Teapot Dome. About oil and money first, and politics second.   Even so, at this early stage, the Enron case has stronger connections at higher levels than the scandal that started as a \"third-rate burglary.\"   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft and a top aide stepped out of the criminal investigation because Ashcroft got $60,000 in Enron contributions during his 2000 senate campaign. The entire U.S. attorney's office in Houston recused itself because of family and professional ties to Enron.   Other administration officials took Enron money, too. President Bush heads the list, with $2 million in donations from Enron Chairman Ken Lay and company employees since 1993.   Money buys access. We'll find out over time if it bought improper influence.   Ken Lay last fall contacted Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans as Enron broke down around him. He reportedly asked O'Neill about a possible government-orchestrated bailout like the one that limited damage from the collapse of Long Term Capital Management.   Enron didn't get a bailout. But there surely will be other influence questions as the Enron saga unfolds.   For example, what emerged from Lay's private meetings with Vice President Cheney during development of the administration's energy policy? What did Lay want from Cheney, anyway--extra room in the strategic petroleum reserve where Andersen could store damaging Enron documents?   An administration's first instinct is to minimize the scandal and deflect attention.   The Bush White House chose to spin this scandal as a possible oversight failure, and a sign regulations can't keep up with an increasingly complex economy.   \"This is not about Enron,\" Treasury's O'Neill told Lou Dobbs on CNN. \"This is about making sure that the rules and regulations that govern the way our economic system works are worthy of the conditions in the market today.\"   Nice try. But it won't work any better for O'Neill than it did for Andersen chief Joe Berardino, who tried a similar argument late last month when he first stepped into the sights of one of the congressional committees investigating the Enron mess.   I'd say Berardino and O'Neill are reading from the same playbook. Except, any playbooks Andersen had probably have been shredded by now.   There are loopholes in oversight, particularly in the mostly self- regulated accounting industry. But O'Neill and Berardino are dead wrong. This scandal certainly is about Enron.   It's about thousands of employees who have lost their jobs and pensions. Investors who have lost their money.   Executives who dumped their stock just before the scandal hit.   And that's just for starters.   Andersen already was at the heart of the scandal. And with Thursday's revelations, it's clear that the Bush administration will be knee-deep in discussing--or maybe denying--its Enron questions for a good long time.   Here's another memorable Watergate reference: The toothpaste really came out of the tube Thursday.   It's never going back in. For President Bush's administration and for Chicago's Andersen, the key question now is how big a mess it will make.   ----------   Contact dgreising@tribune.com.    .....................................................................................................................................     NATIONAL  EXPERTS SAY WILLFUL INTENT TO DECEIVE IS DIFFICULT TO PROVE IN FINANCIAL FRAUD PROSECUTION A TOUGH CHORE  ROBERT MANOR AND MELITA MARIE GARZA, CHICAGO TRIBUNE    01/11/2002  Pittsburgh Post-Gazette   REGION  A-11  (Copyright 2002)     Government attorneys face major obstacles in their investigation of Enron Corp., legal experts say, and while prosecution is possible, it could take many months to find evidence of crime.   The Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other authorities are examining the collapse of Enron, an energy conglomerate that entered bankruptcy late last year. Enron had failed to disclose heavy debts it had taken on through a complex series of partnership agreements, leading investors to believe the company was financially strong.  Despite Enron's spectacular downfall, experts say it is extremely hard to prove criminal wrongdoing when corporate executives engage in deceptive accounting practices.   \"Criminal liability requires a willful attempt to deceive,\" said Jeffrey Gordon, a professor at Columbia Law School. \"Financial fraud cases are very difficult to prosecute because it is difficult to prove to a jury that the irregularities were willful in their intent to deceive.\"   While prosecutors may find it tough going to develop a case against Enron executives, the government does have vast resources to tap. The high-profile nature of Enron's failure -- and the fact that executives sold $1 billion worth of stock before the company announced its accounting problems -- means investigators are likely to use every tool to determine what happened and who is responsible.   Even in the absence of criminal charges, the Justice Department's moves could have a strong impact in Washington, embroiling the Bush administration and others with ties to Enron in a firestorm of damaging disclosures.   Enron, once the nation's seventh largest company in terms of its stock capitalization, was the leading market-maker in energy. It bought power from generators and sold it to consumers. It also traded in coal, fiber-optic bandwidth, plastic and other commodities.   The Justice Department is interested in partnerships Enron set up, allegedly to keep debt off its balance sheet and out of the eyes of investors. Enron recently admitted it had overstated profits by $580 million beginning in 1997.   \"They created limited partnerships where Enron was the master partner in control of the money,\" said Rob Plaza, a stock analyst with Morningstar. \"Then using Enron stock as collateral, they went out and found investors\" to lend the partnership money.   The money went to Enron; but the debt remained, at least in Enron's way of accounting, with the partnership. Plaza said the arrangement, disclosed only late last year, was typical of Houston- based Enron's corporate behavior.   But that does not mean Enron executives are guilty of any crime, and if they are, that the government can prove it to a jury.   \"There may not be a clear rule of law\" that applies to any particular accounting scheme, said Douglas Baird, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School. \"These aren't very well defined offenses.\"   Baird spoke in general and not specifically of Enron. It is rare for a corporate executive to be led away in handcuffs, even in major instances of fraud.   A new problem for investigators emerged yesterday. Chicago-based Andersen, which had audited Enron, said it cannot find a \"significant but undetermined number of electronic and paper documents and correspondence relating\" to Enron.   One securities lawyer said the loss of the Enron documents could hobble the government's case.   \"If Andersen were withholding documents and they were sloppy, that makes it harder for the government to use them as a witness,\" said Brad Bennett, an SEC criminal defense lawyer in Washington, D.C. \"The defense lawyers for Enron could use the loss of the documents to suggest that Andersen was part and parcel of the conspiracy.\"   But John Coffee, a Columbia University Law School professor who testified before Congress on the Enron case, said the government can still use Andersen.   \"The source of testimony most damaging to Enron would be Andersen, \"Coffee said. \"Andersen has said there were errors, and that they made only honest mistakes.\"    .....................................................................................................................................     News  Enron auditor destroyed files ; Top Bush aides talked with CEO about bankruptcy, its implications  William Neikirk and Jeff Zeleny, Washington Bureau Naftali Bendavid of the Tribune's Washington Bureau contributed to this report    01/11/2002  Chicago Tribune   North Sports Final ; N  1  (Copyright 2002 by the Chicago Tribune)     The investigation into the collapse of Enron Corp. widened Thursday as the company's auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, admitted destroying an untold number of documents relating to the Houston energy firm while the White House disclosed that Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay last fall contacted two Cabinet officers about the firm's pending bankruptcy.   As the White House sought to contain election-year political damage from the company's extensive ties with the Bush administration, Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft and the entire U.S. attorney's office in Houston recused themselves from a newly opened criminal investigation into Enron's failure.  Ashcroft had received campaign contributions from Enron during his unsuccessful re-election bid for a U.S. Senate seat from Missouri. In Houston U.S. Atty. Michael Shelby said many prosecutors in his office, including himself, \"have family relationships with individuals who are arguably affected by the Enron bankruptcy.\"   For the first time, the White House disclosed that Lay, a close friend of the president, had called Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans last fall to confirm that Enron \"was heading into bankruptcy.\" He also raised the prospect that the collapse could have major financial implications around the world, similar to those from the demise of a 1998 hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management.   O'Neill told CNN that in the conversations on Oct. 28 and Nov. 8 Lay did not seek government assistance despite making reference to the investment company, which was the subject of a private bailout engineered by the Federal Reserve Board. O'Neill said he and Evans agreed that the administration should not come to Enron's rescue. The two Cabinet officers did not tell Bush of their conversations, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said.   Enron revealed that Lay also called Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan about the company's problems. In a statement, the company said Lay \"felt an obligation\" to let Greenspan, O'Neill and Evans know about Enron's difficulties and did not seek government aid.   Bush said he was unaware of the precarious state of the company that had helped bankroll his Texas and presidential careers.   \"I never discussed with Mr. Lay the financial positions of the company,\" Bush said Thursday in the Oval Office after ordering a review of pension disclosure rules to protect workers in other companies.   The president said he saw Lay twice last year.   \"Ken Lay is a supporter,\" he said. \"But what anybody's going to find is that this administration will fully investigate issues, such as the Enron bankruptcy, to make sure we can learn from the past and make sure that workers are protected.\"   Enron filed for bankruptcy protection in December, a move that proved financially devastating for employees who lost billions of dollars when the company prohibited them from selling Enron shares in their retirement accounts as the shares' value plummeted.   Auditor's destruction policy   Chicago-based Arthur Andersen, which is also the subject of congressional and government probes, said a \"significant but undetermined\" number of electronic and other documents related to its auditing of Enron had been destroyed or deleted. It said its company policy \"required in certain circumstances the destruction of certain types of documents.\"   Even though Andersen said it had retained millions of documents on Enron, the Securities and Exchange Commission called the destruction of documents \"extremely serious.\" The SEC is investigating Andersen's conduct in connection with Enron's failure.   Rep. Billy Tauzin (R-La.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which also is investigating Enron, said thousands of documents had been destroyed. His spokesman, Ken Anderson, said that anyone who destroys records \"to try to subvert our investigation should be prosecuted.\"   The White House sought to get out in front of a story that seems likely to grow larger and more threatening to the administration. Congress returns Jan. 23 and will begin a series of hearings into the Enron collapse and its effect on workers.   Democrats have begun using the word \"scandal\" in connection with Enron and its connections with the Bush administration.   James Jordan, spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, fundraising arm of the party for the upcoming 2002 Senate elections, said Democrats will emphasize that the Bush administration had close political ties with Enron, whose executives were cashing in their stock as many of the company's workers were losing their lifetime savings.   Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.), who has been pushing the White House to disclose more about its contacts with Enron, said the administration could have done more to help the company and its workers.   \"The White House had knowledge that Enron was likely to collapse but did nothing to try to protect innocent employees and shareholders who ultimately lost their life savings,\" he said. \"I am deeply troubled that the White House stood by and let this happen to thousands of families.\"   White House sympathy   At the White House, Bush also expressed his sympathy for the plight of the families.   \"The administration is deeply concerned about its effects on the economy. We are also deeply concerned about the effects on the lives of our citizenry,\" he said.   The new disclosures about Lay's contacts with O'Neill and Evans, who was Bush's campaign chairman in 2000, and the destruction of documents at Arthur Andersen created new political fodder for several panels investigating Enron. A Senate investigations subcommittee planned to issue subpoenas Friday for documents at Enron and Arthur Andersen, as well as from directors and executives of Enron.   Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), chairman of the panel, said: \"Because these are document subpoenas, the criminal investigation will have no effect on our investigation at this time. Hearings of the subcommittee will be scheduled after the subcommittee's review of the documents.\"   Ashcroft's recusal, along with that of his top aide, David Ayers, who was his campaign manager in the 2000 Missouri Senate race, also could lead to fallout the administration would find undesirable. Ashcroft received $57,499 from Enron and its executives in that race, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.   Pressure is beginning to build for appointment of a special prosecutor to look into the case. Although the independent counsel law expired in 1999 after the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, the attorney general has wide discretion to name a special counsel.   Larry Noble, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, said an outside counsel is needed now.   \"With Ashcroft's involvement and now recusal, and with President Bush's relationship with Ken Lay, there are real concerns about the Department of Justice being able to handle the investigation,\" Noble said.   White House spokesman Fleischer said Bush trusts the Justice Department to handle the case.   \"The Department of Justice has conflict-of-interest rules, and if there is anything that the attorney general is aware of that would trigger it, the president knows he will take responsible action,\" he said.   In seeking to control political damage from Enron's collapse, Fleischer said the American people don't have the tolerance to endure \"a partisan witch hunt.\" He said that Enron contributed to Democratic and Republican candidates.   Enron generous to GOP   The Center for Public Integrity, a non-partisan campaign-finance watchdog group, said top Enron executives contributed nearly $800,000 to Bush, the Republican and Democratic Parties and members of Congress. Only one-tenth of that money went to Democrats, the center said.   During his daily briefing, Fleischer was placed on the defensive as questions mounted about the broadening investigation into how the world's largest buyer and seller of natural gas fell into financial ruin. He downplayed the telephone calls to O'Neill and Evans, saying it was not uncommon for administration officials to be asked for help for a struggling company or industry.   \"Bankruptcies happen in our economy,\" he said. \"It's not uncommon for people who are in the community, business community or in the labor community, to talk to a Cabinet secretary to tell the financial status of their business.\"    PHOTOS 3 GRAPHIC; Caption: PHOTO (color): President Bush on Thursday described Enron CEO Kenneth Lay (above) as a \"supporter\" but said, \"I never discussed with Mr. Lay the financial positions of the company.\" PHOTOS: Enron's CEO called Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill (left) and Commerce chief Don Evans.

If they said, `We were lied to by the various officers we relied on'--that kind of testimony would be very strong and the kind of testimony needed to prove criminal intent. It already has been said to a degree by Andersen in congressional testimony.\"   Coffee acknowledged that Andersen would look a \"little strange\" if unable to find the Enron documents. \"But Andersen accountants had long face-to-face meetings with Enron executives that may buttress their assertions about potential misrepresentations.   \"The jury could sit there and say both Enron and Andersen are crooks and still believe Andersen was lied to,\" Coffee said.    .....................................................................................................................................     National Desk  THE NATION Ashcroft Recuses Himself From Probe Into Fallen Energy Giant Investigation: Enron's vast connections in D.C. and Texas have created an obstacle to the Justice Department's inquiry.  JOSH MEYER; JAMES GERSTENZANG  TIMES STAFF WRITERS    01/11/2002  Los Angeles Times   Home Edition  A-22  Copyright 2002 / The Times Mirror Company     WASHINGTON -- Enron's many financial and political ties to the Bush administration and other government officials are already complicating a nascent criminal probe by the Justice Department into the bankrupt energy company.   And Enron's entrenched network of connections at the White House and on Capitol Hill--forged by political contributions, lobbying and personal ties--are making it difficult for politicians to keep at arm's length the growing furor engulfing the company.  The most obvious example is Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft's announcement Thursday that he and his chief of staff, David Ayres, are recusing themselves--removing themselves from any involvement in what will surely be one of the Justice Department's highest-profile criminal investigations of the year.   The reason: Ashcroft and Ayres didn't want anyone to think that they--or the Justice Department--would go easy on Enron because the company's chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, other Enron employees and the company's political action committee had contributed more than $57,000 in 2000 to Ashcroft's failed senatorial campaign, which Ayres managed.   Ashcroft insisted that he has not been involved in any aspect of the Enron investigation. He said his deputy, Larry Thompson, would take his place if and when high-level consultations are needed.   In Houston, Enron's hometown, U.S. Atty. Michael T. Shelby recused not only himself Thursday but also his entire office of federal prosecutors, who were expected to play a prominent role in the criminal investigation.   In Shelby's case, the recusals came for the opposite reason: Too many prosecutors--himself included--had friends and family members who had worked for Enron and had suffered numbing financial losses when its stock price plummeted.   \"We might be viewed as being overly aggressive because we know people, and in some cases are married to people, who lost substantial amounts of money as a result of the collapse of the company,\" Shelby said in an interview. \"In my case, it's my wife's brother who works there.\"   Whether they fear being perceived as going too easy or too hard on Enron, the prosecutors' ties to the company could well hamper the investigation in its early stages, some Justice Department officials and outside legal experts said Thursday. Because of the likelihood of conflicts in the Houston office, the Justice Department this week convened a task force out of its Washington headquarters in an effort to determine whether any laws were broken as the company collapsed late last year, shredding billions of investor dollars and costing thousands of jobs.   \"This investigation needs to go forward, and it needs to go forward in an expeditious and focused way,\" Shelby said. \"And there needs to be a seamless transition between this office and the Department of Justice.\"   Enron has long sought to be influential in Texas and Washington, and it has succeeded through political contributions to both parties, extensive lobbying and personal ties.   Although few, if any, elected officials have said they will recuse themselves from the congressional investigations into the Enron collapse, many have connections to the company.   The most obvious example is Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, the senior Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, which is investigating the Enron matter. Gramm's wife, Wendy, has served on Enron's board of directors.   And Enron has deep links to President Bush and others in his administration.   It was disclosed Thursday that Lay called two Cabinet members, Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans, late last year to discuss the company's financial problems. O'Neill, through a spokeswoman, acknowledged being an acquaintance of Lay's. Evans, a former oil company executive, has long-standing connections to the Texas political and business worlds as well.   Overall, Enron's political action committee and the company's employees and directors contributed a total of $5.7 million to candidates and the two political parties--73% of that to Republicans--in the last seven election cycles, according to an analysis conducted by the Center for Responsive Politics. Bush received $113,800 for his presidential campaign, Gramm received $97,350, and Texas' other Republican senator, Kay Bailey Hutchison, received $99,500.   Enron's employees and directors have given $623,000 to Bush during his political career, according to the Center for Public Integrity.   Bush's chief economic advisor, Lawrence B. Lindsey, served on an Enron advisory board and, according to documents the White House made public last year, received $50,000 from the company before he joined the administration a year ago.   Karl Rove, Bush's senior advisor, delayed selling his significant portfolio of Enron stock for several months after taking office, to avoid having to pay capital gains taxes on his profits, and met with Lay while holding the stock.   Former Montana Gov. Marc Racicot, soon to become chairman of the Republican National Committee, was recently a lobbyist for Enron.   Some Democrats plan to take up the issue of the Bush administration's connections to Enron as the various investigations progress.   \"The White House has to do a complete disclosure of all the contacts administration representatives had with Enron,\" said Phil Schilero, chief of staff to Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles).   *   Times researcher Robert Patrick contributed to this report.    .....................................................................................................................................     National Desk  THE NATION Destruction of Records 'Unusual,' Experts Say  JAMES F. PELTZ  TIMES STAFF WRITER    01/11/2002  Los Angeles Times   Home Edition  A-23  Copyright 2002 / The Times Mirror Company     The disclosure Thursday by Andersen, the accounting firm, that it destroyed a \"significant\" number of documents of client Enron Corp. in recent months came as a surprise to the accounting industry, which typically keeps such records for years even though there aren't strict rules regulating an auditor's paperwork storage.   Anderson's action \"is unusual,\" said Jonathan Hamilton, editor of the Public Accounting Report, a trade publication. \"Usually in the case of an ongoing client relationship, you find it useful\" to keep nearly all documents, he said.  And if there's even a hint that the accounting firm or its client might be involved in litigation down the road, \"the general rule is that you keep everything,\" Hamilton said.   In November, Houston-based Enron said it had inflated profits by $586 million since 1997. The energy company is operating under bankruptcy court protection and is under criminal investigation by the Justice Department, an inquiry expected to focus on possible accounting fraud.   The company also is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and several congressional committees.   The SEC's director of enforcement, Stephen Cutler, said in a statement that the destruction of Enron-related documents and electronic files by Andersen, formerly known as Arthur Andersen, are \"an extremely serious matter\" because documents \"are an essential ingredient in our investigations.\"   But he didn't say whether Andersen's action was illegal, and the SEC declined further comment. Andersen said it still has \"millions of documents related to Enron\" but that its policy for record storage--a policy that Andersen said it has now suspended--required that some documents be destroyed.   The Financial Accounting Standards Board, which issues guidelines for how accounting firms should audit a company's books, doesn't offer set rules for saving documents, said spokeswoman Sheryl Thompson. Another trade group, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, recommends that accounting firms keep documents for as long as they serve the needs of the firm.   But that guideline is open to broad interpretation, and the storage of documents varies from firm to firm.   Even so, most accounting firms keep their audit records for at least three to four years, Arthur Bowman, editor of the industry newsletter Bowman's Accounting Report, told Reuters.   None of the other big accounting firms could immediately be reached for comment, but industry insiders said some firms have a standard practice of keeping records for a minimum of six years.   Hamilton said it's not the first time that an accounting firm has raised questions by destroying corporate documents.   \"It's come up from time to time in the profession, especially when we had the dot-com shakeout,\" he said.   The collapse of many high-technology companies sparked shareholder lawsuits that led to accounting firms saying they had destroyed the auditing documents in certain cases \"because they're not our client anymore,\" Hamilton added.    .....................................................................................................................................     Business  Enron called on Bush cabinet Lay sought advice  CP Wire    01/11/2002  Winnipeg Free Press   Metro  b3  All material Copyright (c) Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc. and its licensors. All rights reserved.     WASHINGTON -- Enron chairman Kenneth Lay reached out to two of President George W. Bush's cabinet officers when the Houston-based energy company was collapsing, the White House disclosed yesterday as the Justice Department opened a criminal investigation of Enron's bankruptcy.   Bush, who received significant campaign contributions from Lay and other Enron executives, said he himself has never discussed Enron's financial problems with its embattled corporate chairman. The president said he last saw Lay in Texas at a spring fund-raiser for former first lady Barbara Bush's literacy foundation.  Lay also was among a group of some 20 business leaders who came to the White House early in the Bush administration to discuss the state of the economy, Bush said.   Many Enron employees lost their life savings when the company filed for bankruptcy Dec. 2.   \"What anybody's going to find out is that this administration will fully investigate issues such as the Enron bankruptcy, to make sure we can learn from the past and make sure workers are protected,\" Bush said.   But Lay did seek the ear of other top-level administration officials last fall.   According to White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, Lay telephoned Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill amid Enron's collapse \"to advise him about his concern about the obligations of Enron and whether they would be able to meet those obligations.\"   Lay also told O'Neill that Enron \"was heading to bankruptcy,\" Fleischer said.   O'Neill received calls from Lay on Oct. 28 and Nov. 8, said Treasury spokeswoman Michele Davis. It was on Oct. 16 that Enron made its stunning disclosure of a $638-million US third-quarter loss.   In a separate phone call to Commerce Secretary Don Evans, Lay similarly worried that the company might have to default on its obligations. He brought to the secretary's attention \"that he was having problems with his bond rating and he was worried about its impact on the energy sector,\" Fleischer said.   After that conversation, Evans spoke to O'Neill \"and they both agreed no action should be taken to intervene with their bond holders,\" Fleischer said.   The firm that audited the books of collapsed Enron Corp., Arthur Andersen LLP, disclosed yesterday that a \"significant but undetermined\" number of documents related to the company had been destroyed.   Andersen's auditing work for Enron, which entered last month into the largest corporate bankruptcy in U.S. history, is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.   -- Associated Press    .....................................................................................................................................     Business  Outlook: Enron/pensions    01/11/2002  The Independent - London   FOREIGN  15  (Copyright 2002 Independent Newspapers (UK) Limited)     THE US President, George W Bush, has ordered a review of US pension regulations following the collapse of Enron. One of the most disturbing aspects of the insolvency was that employees had more than half their pension fund assets invested in Enron shares, which are now worthless.   Worse, due to an administrative change in the scheme, employees were prevented from divesting their Enron holdings during a crucial 10 day period of bad news in late October and early November when the stock lost nearly a third of its value. Forget the now active criminal investigation into false accounting at Enron. The real scandal is that as directors piled out of the stock they had been so active in promoting, their downtrodden staff were locked in to face the music.  Many employees have thus suffered a double blow of both losing their jobs and the great bulk of their retirement nest egg. In Britain's last big corporate scandal, Robert Maxwell stole from the pension fund in order to prop up his ailing business empire, but in the end no one suffered as badly as Enron employees seem likely to. Nearly all the stolen Maxwell millions were eventually recovered, and job losses were minimal.   The lax audit, banking and management practices that allowed the Maxwell scandal to happen were much mocked on the other side of the Atlantic at the time, in apparent disregard of the mote in America's own eye. Indeed, in recent years it has become fashionable to praise the 401k pension plans that sanction such reckless investment in the employer's own stock. Many respectable British voices have been heard to lobby for the same thing here.   Not much danger of that now. As it happens, Enron is by no means the worst case of incest in the pension fund. Coca-Cola, General Electric and McDonald's all have more than 75 per cent of their 401k pension plans invested in their own stock, and jolly proud of it they were too until the Enron collapse so painfully demonstrated the downside of having all your eggs in one basket. On this side of the Atlantic, where on the whole we are much more cautious about the way our pension money is invested, it's hard to understand how such a high risk strategy could ever have been allowed.   In part it's cultural. US companies actively encourage employees to buy into every aspect of the sales pitch. And although the 401k plans are meant to empower employees to make their own decisions on where their pensions are invested, in practice they tend to offer only a very limited range of options, prominent among which is naturally the company's own stock. In Enron's case, the employers' pension contribution was made not in cash, as it is in Britain, but stock. For every dollar invested, there would be 50 cents of Enron stock. Again this is pretty much standard practice across a large number of big US corporations.   A painful period of adjustment is now in prospect as new laws are introduced limiting exposure to any one asset to, say, 10 per cent of the total. The excesses of the last bull market are not so easily buried, it would seem.    .....................................................................................................................................     NATIONAL  ENRON MESS GETS MESSIER DONOR ASKED WHITE HOUSE TO HELP WARD OFF BANKRUPTCY  DANA MILBANK AND PETER BEHR, THE WASHINGTON POST    01/11/2002  Pittsburgh Post-Gazette   REGION  A-1  (Copyright 2002)     Bush administration officials yesterday disclosed that the top official of Enron Corp., one of President Bush's biggest campaign donors, sought help from the administration to avoid bankruptcy in the weeks before the giant energy concern collapsed last year, wiping out the pensions of thousands of workers.   Enron chief executive Kenneth L. Lay had conversations about his company's dire finances with Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans, telling Evans, Bush's former campaign manager, that he would welcome help stopping a private credit-rating agency from downgrading Enron debt -- an event that could force Enron into bankruptcy. Administration officials said yesterday that Evans did not intervene. Enron's bankruptcy, filed on Dec. 2, is the largest in U.S. history.  Also yesterday, Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen, informed the government that employees at the accounting firm had destroyed a \"significant\" number of Enron-related documents -- thousands of records, according to congressional investigators. The Securities and Exchange Commission took the unusual step yesterday of saying it is widening its investigation of Enron Corp. to include the destruction of records.   As the controversy grew yesterday, Attorney General John Ashcroft and one of his top aides recused themselves from the Justice Department's just-announced criminal investigation into Enron's collapse. Ashcroft's political committees had received $57,499 in the last election cycle. The entire U.S. attorney's staff in Enron's hometown of Houston also recused themselves because of Enron ties.   The drumbeat of developments significantly expanded the controversy over Enron and its ties to the administration at a time when the White House has been seeking to limit the political damage. Earlier this month, the White House disclosed that the energy task force met six times with Enron officials but said the company's finances were not discussed.   Until yesterday, the White House spokesman had said he had no knowledge of contacts between Bush officials and Enron about the events leading to its demise. The White House said O'Neill and Evans, who was Bush's campaign manager, did not notify Bush until yesterday of their contacts with Lay about Enron's trouble.   Bush yesterday commissioned task forces to provide recommendations to reform pension laws \"to make sure that people are not exposed to losing their life savings as the result of a bankruptcy\" and \"to analyze corporate disclosure rules and regulations.\"   On Capitol Hill, Republicans joined Democrats in calling for probes into Enron. The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee will hold hearings on Jan. 24 and the Senate Commerce Committee will begin hearings on Feb. 4. The House Energy and Commerce Committee, whose investigators discovered that Andersen had destroyed Enron documents, will also have hearings in \"early February,\" a committee spokesman said yesterday.   The White House faces increased pressure from Congress to disclose all meetings its energy task force had with energy industry officials when it developed the administration's energy policy last year. Congress's General Accounting Office said that it would decide within the month whether it would take the administration to court over its refusal to provide information on which groups it met with to develop the energy policy.   Lay, whose name appeared on early lists of possible Bush Cabinet secretaries, was one of the Bush \"Pioneers\" who raised at least $100,000 for the presidential campaign. According to the Center for Public Integrity, a watchdog group, Lay contributed $44,000 to Bush's presidential campaign, part of $220,700 in contributions to Bush's presidential efforts by top Enron executives. Between 1999 and 2001, Enron made $1.9 million in unregulated soft-money contributions, mostly to Republicans.   The president yesterday said he \"never discussed with Mr. Lay the financial problems of the company.\" Bush added that his \"administration will fully investigate issues such as the Enron bankruptcy to make sure we can learn from the past and make sure that workers are protected.\"   Administration officials said Lay discussed Enron's plight with O'Neill on Oct. 28 and Nov. 8, and Evans on Oct. 29. On Oct. 16, Enron reported a $638 million loss and the first in a series of damaging errors in its accounting.   White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said Lay called O'Neill \"to advise him about his concern about the obligations of Enron.\" Lay suggested the case of Long-Term Capital Management LP could be a model. In 1998, that firm, a hedge fund, benefited from a government- coordinated bailout by other financial institutions after losing more than $4 billion in derivatives, a complex securities transaction.   \"Long Term Capital was unable to meet its obligations and headed to bankruptcy, and he wanted Secretary O'Neill to be aware of that, the Long Term Capital experience as a guide,\" Fleischer said. \"Secretary O'Neill then contacted Undersecretary [Peter] Fisher, Undersecretary Fisher looked at that and concluded there would be no more impact on the overall economy.\" Fisher had been involved in the Long-Term Capital bailout as a Federal Reserve official.   O'Neill said he considered his two conversations with Lay to be \"business as usual.\" O'Neill told CNN: \"I get calls every day from the big players in the world. Enron was the biggest trader of energy in the world.\"   In addition, Fleischer said Lay brought to Evans' attention \"the problems with the obligations and the bankruptcy. He was having problems with his bond ratings and was worried about its impact on the energy sector.\" Commerce spokesman Jim Dyke said Lay indicated \"he would welcome any support the secretary thought was appropriate\" persuading Moody's Investor Services not to downgrade Enron's debt. Evans talked to his general counsel and conferred with O'Neill over lunch on Oct. 29 and decided not to take action, Dyke said.   At the time Lay approached Evans, Moody's Investors Service was considering downgrading the credit rating on billions of dollars in Enron debt, an action that was certain to drive Enron's stock down further and cut deeply into its trading business, financial analysts had warned. On Nov. 28, Moody's and other rating services did downgrade Enron's bond to junk status, forcing it into bankruptcy.   Enron's attorney, Robert Bennett, said Lay believed he had an obligation to alert the administration to Enron's increasingly precarious condition and the possibility that the nation's largest energy trader could fall into bankruptcy. \"He asked them for nothing,\" Bennett said.   Federal and congressional investigators are probing whether senior Enron executives exaggerated its profits and concealed rapidly- mounting debts through a labyrinth of hundreds of investment partnerships and offshore corporations, thus making the company appear stronger than it really was.   Andersen's disclosure of destroyed records, which led the firm to hire former senator John Danforth to examine Andersen's records management, infuriated lawmakers. Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., who heads a Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee investigation of Enron, said the destroyed records would be a new priority.   \"This a deeply troubling development,\" House Commerce Chairman Billy Tauzin, R-La., said of the lost documents. \"Anyone who destroyed records simply out of stupidity should be fired. Anybody who destroyed records to try and subvert our investigation should be prosecuted.\"   Investigators for the House Energy and Commerce Committee first requested the records on Dec. 13. But Enron's lawyer, Bennett, said Enron was unaware that Andersen was destroying records. \"The first they heard of it was today,\" Bennett said, after checking with a senior Enron executive.    .....................................................................................................................................     NATIONAL  DEMOCRATS ASK: WHAT DID BUSH KNOW, AND WHEN DID HE KNOW IT?  DON VAN NATTA JR., THE NEW YORK TIMES    01/11/2002  Pittsburgh Post-Gazette   REGION  A-1  (Copyright 2002)     The exploding Enron saga presents all the elements of earlier Washington scandals, including carefully phrased denials and accusations of improper influence. And in a matter of hours yesterday, it sent the White House into a full-scale effort to contain the potential damage to President Bush at a time when he wants to focus on the war on terrorism and the flagging economy.   The White House spent much of the day trying to distance the president from a torrent of bad news about the fall of the Houston energy conglomerate.  Although no one has suggested that Bush has done anything wrong, the connections between his presidency and Enron are uncomfortably close. The company's chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, has been a close friend of Bush for many years, and Lay and other Enron executives have contributed more to Bush over his political career than anyone else -- an amount exceeding $550,000.   Those connections were made vividly clear yesterday when the White House disclosed that Lay sought government aid last fall from Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and from Bush's best friend and presidential campaign chairman, Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans.   The day began with Bush expressing sympathy for Enron employees whose retirement accounts were wiped out by the collapse of the company's stock, and ended with calls from Congress for a criminal investigation of the company's auditors for destroying documents.   Throughout the day, White House officials denied that Bush had been aware of the company's precarious finances or had ever been asked to come to Enron's rescue.   But on Capitol Hill, Democrats were already beginning to ask of the president, \"What did he know and when did he know it?\" And questions were being raised about whether the criminal inquiry should be led by a special counsel rather than by the Justice Department, because Attorney General John Ashcroft received $57,499 in campaign contributions from Enron and Lay, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.   Ashcroft and his chief of staff recused themselves from the criminal investigation that will attempt to determine whether the company or its executives committed fraud before Enron went bankrupt. But critics still questioned whether the department, which includes many other political appointees, could independently investigate the company.   Scandal pieces in place   Just as Enron's collapse was stunning because it occurred so quickly and so completely, the latest disclosures have reawakened Washington's now-familiar scandal machinery, which had remained practically dormant since Sept. 11. Washington may once again face months, if not years, of yet another investigation of the White House featuring the volatile mix of money, influence, access and politics.   All the elements of a classic political scandal are here: A Texas corporation, led by Bush's most generous campaign contributor, files the largest bankruptcy petition in American history. A handful of Enron executives are able to sell $1 billion worth of the company's stock before its collapse, but thousands of employees are barred from selling, losing their life's savings and their retirement accounts.   And just this week, the White House disclosed that Enron executives, and its chairman, had meetings and discussions with Cabinet members, White House officials and Vice President Dick Cheney before and during the corporation's implosion.   On top of everything else, the accounting firm that audited Enron's books, Arthur Andersen LLP, disclosed yesterday that a \"significant but undetermined\" number of documents related to the company had been destroyed.   \"This is the perfect storm,\" said Phil Schiliro, the press secretary for Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif. \"It's the biggest bankruptcy in American corporate history -- a bankruptcy where a small number of executives enriched themselves to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars while thousands of employees were left with worthless stock. And in 2001, Enron is the most influential company in Washington. When you piece it all together, there are many questions that need to be answered.\"   Bush said yesterday that he had never discussed Enron's financial woes with Lay, who has supported Bush politically since his unsuccessful campaign for Congress in 1978. Bush said he last saw Lay in Texas at an April 30 fund-raiser for former first lady Barbara Bush's literacy foundation. At the time, Enron's share price was nearly $60 a share; its closing price yesterday was 67 cents per share.   Both Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill have pledged to work together to get to the bottom of the matter. But some Democratic officials expressed glee that questions about White House influence- peddling seemed to be emerging as a major political story of 2002.   \"If their goal was to give this story a head of steam, they have succeeded,\" Jennifer Palmieri, the press secretary of the Democratic National Committee.   Five separate congressional committees have sent out subpoenas on the Enron matter. The first of many congressional hearings expected this year is scheduled for Jan. 24 by the Senate Government Affairs committee, which is chaired by Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., who may be thinking of running for president in 2004.   Several congressmen demanded again yesterday for the White House to release records of all its contacts with Enron executives, including phone messages and e-mails.   \"In contrast to the six contacts the White House disclosed,\" Waxman said, \"I suspect there were dozens of conversations between administration officials and Enron representatives during the past year. The public and Congress should have this information, especially since it is now clear the White House had knowledge that Enron was likely to collapse but did nothing to try to protect innocent employees and shareholders who ultimately lost their life savings.\"    .....................................................................................................................................     National Desk  THE NATION Auditor Says It Destroyed Enron Records Finance: The admission angers investigators of the energy firm's messy bankruptcy. Its chief sought help from two Cabinet members, the White House reveals.  RICHARD SIMON; JAMES GERSTENZANG  TIMES STAFF WRITERS    01/11/2002  Los Angeles Times   Home Edition  A-1  Copyright 2002 / The Times Mirror Company     WASHINGTON -- The accounting firm Andersen acknowledged Thursday that it destroyed a \"significant\" number of documents related to its audit of Enron Corp., as the White House disclosed that Enron's chief executive contacted Bush Cabinet members for help when the energy company was collapsing.   Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans said they listened to Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay's description of the firm's dire financial problems last fall but took no action.  Both revelations deepened the controversy over Enron's sudden failure--one that has financial, legal and political overtones. The disclosure by Andersen, until recently known as Arthur Andersen, prompted outrage in Congress and could complicate federal investigations into the massive bankruptcy.   Andersen said in a statement that it had disposed of a \"significant but undetermined number of electronic and paper documents and correspondence\" relating to Enron. Investigators could not immediately say what documents were destroyed. A company spokesman said the matter is under review and would not say whether the destruction was accidental or intentional. The company said millions of documents related to Enron still exist.   A congressional aide said Andersen notified investigators that \"potentially thousands of records\" were destroyed in September, October and November. Investigators plan to meet with the head of Andersen's Houston office next week and question him on the matter.   Despite the administration's efforts to distance itself from the Enron fiasco, the company's huge political footprint continued to create problems. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft, his chief of staff and the entire U.S. attorney's office in Houston, where Enron is based, recused themselves from the criminal probe of the company because of potential conflicts of interest.   Ashcroft received campaign contributions from Enron for his failed 2000 Senate campaign, and the U.S. attorney in Houston said many on his staff have family members who could be affected by the Enron bankruptcy.   The fallout touched the White House, as President Bush ordered senior officials to recommend reforms of the pension system and to examine federal rules governing corporate disclosures. Investigators are probing whether company officials withheld financial information from investors who, along with employees in the company pension plan, suffered huge losses in the firm's collapse.   \"Ken Lay is a supporter,\" the president said of the Enron executive, a generous donor to Bush's political campaigns. \"But what anybody's going to find is that this administration will fully investigate issues, such as the Enron bankruptcy, to make sure we can learn from the past and make sure that workers are protected.\"   The latest twist in the Enron saga came one day after the Justice Department launched a criminal probe of the company, investigating, among other matters, whether Enron knew of problems but failed to disclose them. In congressional testimony last month, the head of Andersen said he had warned Enron that the company might be guilty of \"possible illegal acts\" for withholding financial information from auditors--an allegation Enron denied.   Andersen's destruction of records drew angry reactions from members of Congress investigating the accounting methods used by the auditor.   Chairman W.J. \"Billy\" Tauzin (R-La.) of the House Energy and Commerce Committee called the loss \"deeply troubling\" and vowed to investigate.   \"It should never have happened,\" Tauzin said. \"Clearly this is a very serious matter. Anyone who destroyed records simply out of stupidity should be fired; anyone who destroyed records intentionally to subvert our investigation should be prosecuted.\"   \"The list of problems and problem people involved in this entire tawdry affair seems destined to grow,\" said Rep. John D. Dingell of Michigan, the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. \"The seriousness of this matter cries out for further investigation.\"   Stephen Cutler, director of the Securities and Exchange Commission's enforcement division, called the record destruction an \"extremely serious matter\" but added that it \"will not deter us from pursuit of our investigation and will be included within the scope of our investigation.\"   The SEC is investigating whether Enron used loopholes in accounting regulations to hide debt. In addition, Congress is looking into Andersen's interpretation of accounting rules that allowed Enron to exclude losses at several partnerships from its reporting. Enron and Andersen dispute who is to blame for the faulty accounting.   On Oct. 16, Enron reported a third-quarter loss of $638 million and disclosed a $1.2-billion reduction in shareholder equity. On Nov. 8, it announced it had overstated its earnings by $586 million during the last four years, sending the company's stock tumbling from more than $90 a share a year earlier to less than a dollar. The meltdown cost more than 4,000 employees their jobs and destroyed the retirement savings of employees with company-sponsored savings plans.   Because, as the company said, the retirement plan was changing administrators, those employees were locked out of selling their shares at the time the stock began its most precipitous descent. However, many executives managed to sell their shares just before the stock's plunge.   The company filed for protection from its creditors Dec. 2.   At the White House, Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Lay called O'Neill and Evans separately, reporting \"his concerns about whether or not Enron would be able to meet its obligations.\"   O'Neill said in the two calls he received--on Oct. 28 and Nov. 8, according to an aide--Lay expressed concern about the implications for the capital markets and also that a possible downgrading of the company's credit rating might ruin a pending merger prospect.   Lay did not ask for anything specific, O'Neill said. \"As secretary of the Treasury with responsibility for the U.S. capital markets, I get calls every day from the big players in the world\" warning about important financial events, he told CNN.   But Treasury spokeswoman Michele Davis said Lay did draw a comparison with Long Term Capital Management, a large investment firm that was saved from collapse in 1998 by a federally orchestrated private bailout.   Lay \"expressed a concern that if Enron went bankrupt, it would affect the credit markets the way the Long Term Capital Management problems a few years earlier affected the credit markets, that it would have ripple effects throughout the whole banking sector,\" she said.   Davis said O'Neill never discussed a bailout or any other kind of aid for Enron.   Evans said Lay was hoping for high-level \"support.\"   Fleischer said that the secretaries decided not to inform Bush of the calls and that Bush did not learn of them until Thursday morning.   Fleischer said Evans and O'Neill handled the matter appropriately. Communication \"is not a wrongdoing. What took place here was they received phone calls and took no action.\"   However, Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) said the calls show that the administration had advance word of Enron's collapse and did nothing to protect shareholders or employees.   Fleischer dismissed the criticism as partisan rhetoric, \"what people have become so used to in Washington, which is a politically charged, politically motivated effort to blame one party or to look only at one party.\" Enron, he said, has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to both parties.   Bush said he had not spoken with Lay about his company's financial problems and had not seen him since last spring, when they met at a Houston theater where the president's mother was the sponsor of a book-reading fund-raiser by celebrity authors.   Lay was a so-called pioneer in Bush's presidential campaign, which meant he committed to raising at least $100,000.   Lay also personally contributed more than $275,000 to the Republican National Committee during the 2000 election cycle, part of overall donations from company employees and directors to the RNC that exceeded $1.1 million. Enron gave $100,000 to help pay for Bush's inauguration. In that cycle, Enron employees and directors gave $530,000 to the Democratic National Committee; Lay made no personal contributions to the DNC.   In calling for an examination of the pension rules, Bush said he directed O'Neill, Evans and Labor Secretary Elaine Chao to determine \"the effects of the current law on hard-working Americans and to come up with recommendations of how to reform the system to make sure that people are not exposed to losing their life savings as the result of a bankruptcy, for example.\"   In addition, he said that O'Neill, along with the SEC, the Federal Reserve and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission would study corporate disclosure rules and regulations in light of the Enron bankruptcy.   \"There needs to be a full review of disclosure rules to make sure that the American stockholder, or any stockholder, is protected,\" Bush said.   Enron grew from a small natural-gas pipeline operator into the world's largest energy-trading operation. At its peak, it handled 1 in 4 wholesale deals for electricity, gas and other energy products.   The company championed energy deregulation and tried to influence the way California structured its energy markets and how the state steered through its electricity crisis. It became a target of attacks from politicians, regulators and consumer activists for its aggressive business tactics.   *   Times staff writers Josh Meyer in Washington, Thomas S.

EDITORIAL  WORK FOR CONGRESS ISSUES DEMAND ATTENTION ON SEVERAL FRONTS    01/11/2002  Pittsburgh Post-Gazette   REGION  A-14  (Copyright 2002)     Congress is scheduled to return to its duties in Washington on Jan. 24 after a month off. Its agenda is filling up rapidly with urgent business.   The first item on the agenda is to complete work on an economic stimulus package, dropped because of a stalemate before Christmas. National economic indicators are sufficiently mixed as to suggest that such a bill would still serve a useful purpose, even though it should have been passed before Congress adjourned for the holidays for more timely impact. Unemployment continues to rise, by another 0.2 percent in December to 5.8 percent, the highest it has been since 1995.  Hearings are being scheduled for next month to look into the failure of the U.S. intelligence community regarding Sept. 11. Its budgets amount to $30 billion annually. Yet it failed to detect the scheming that terrorists were carrying out under America's nose for probably a year before the attacks.   A third useful piece of business that needs to be addressed urgently -- given that 2002 is a congressional election year -- is campaign finance reform, currently stuck in the House. Republican and Democratic Congressional Campaign committees have both reported fund- raising in eight figures already for the 2002 campaign.   Continued foot-dragging, for example, on the Shays-Meehan bill banning soft money leads past more elegant arguments to only one conclusion -- that our representatives like to have access to as much unlimited \"soft\" money as possible to use in persuading the voters to re-elect them. Failure to pass campaign finance reform legislation is, in fact, a very good reason not to re-elect them.   The Post-Gazette also welcomes congressional plans to conduct hearings to shed light on the collapse of Enron, America's seventh- largest company before its fall. Matters that need to be made clear include Enron's corporate and individual executives' campaign contributions -- an accounting of how much, to whose campaign and the timing of various gifts and whether they correlated to the progressive collapse of the company.   In advance, there seems nothing wrong in Enron executives making recommendations to Bush administration energy policy-makers. It would be normal to consult a company of that size in such a market. The problem would be if those recommendations were accepted and thus contributed to what turned out to be Enron's deception of stockholders and the market.   The special task force that the Justice Department is putting together will look closely into that and other important subjects. It will investigate whether Enron's top executives engaged in criminal activity by selling off $1 billion of their Enron stock held in 401(k) retirement plans in advance of the declaration of bankruptcy - - while forbidding lower-level employees to sell theirs. Congressional examination of these issues can suggest whether new legislation is required.    .....................................................................................................................................     Companies: U.S. Task Force Will Pursue Enron Investigation --- Criminal Probe to Target Possible Accounting Fraud  By Rebecca Smith  Staff Reporter    01/11/2002  The Wall Street Journal Europe   4  (Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)     The U.S. Justice Department said a task force has been formed to pursue a criminal investigation of Enron Corp., confirming a probe that is expected to center on possible accounting fraud.   The investigation will be run by the department's criminal division coordinating among U.S. Attorneys in New York City, San Francisco, Houston and elsewhere. The Wall Street Journal first reported the criminal investigation in early December.  Enron, the U.S.'s biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas, filed for bankruptcy-court protection following a crisis of confidence among its investors. The problems have resulted largely from Enron's dealings with private partnerships, run by some of its own executives. The company saw its market value plunge recently to about $540 million (606 million euros) from more than $77 billion last year.   The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which has been investigating Enron since October, and the Justice Department could both file cases alleging violations of securities laws if Enron is found to have intentionally misled investors about its financial condition. Several congressional committees also have begun inquiries into various aspects of Enron's collapse.   Enron acknowledged that it is the target of a criminal investigation by the Justice Department. \"It has been the posture of the company to fully cooperate with government investigations,\" said Robert Bennett, an attorney with Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, which represents the company. \"At the end of day, I'm pretty optimistic . . . an objective person will see that many of the things said and written (about Enron) aren't true.\"   Confirmation of the probe came even as nearly two dozen firms asked a U.S. bankruptcy-court judge to temporarily block Enron's intended sale of its energy-trading business, until recently the earnings juggernaut for the entire company.   The court approved an auction process on Dec. 19 that was to have resulted in the announcement of the winning bidder as early as Friday.   Bidders for pieces of Enron's energy-trading business, which still has a staff of about 1,000 people, include Citigroup Inc., UBS AG and BP PLC, people familiar with the matter have said.   But a host of creditors have asked the court to delay the sale indefinitely. The list includes institutions such as Royal Bank of Scotland PLC and GE Capital Corp. as well as power-trading rivals such as Mirant Corp., El Paso Merchant Energy LP and Aquila Inc., a unit of Utilicorp United Inc.   Aquila said it doesn't oppose the sale, per se, but wants guarantees that Enron will put the proceeds in an escrow account until a determination has been made about how it will be split among creditors.   Mirant in its pleadings with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, said the sales materials circulated by Enron lacked \"significant material information that is essential . . . to make an informed decision regarding the wisdom of the transaction.\"   The materials lack a minimum bid, which \"begs the question,\" Mirant said, \"as to whether there is a bid that is simply too low to accept or whether the debtors are preparing to sell at any price.\" Challengers also questioned who would be responsible for liabilities excluded from the sale.   Enron's energy-marketing unit, which includes its once-mighty EnronOnline Internet-based trading platform, traded dozens of products until recently and generated roughly 90% of the firm's earnings in the most recent quarter. It also was responsible for the bulk of Enron's 2001 revenue of $101 billion.    .....................................................................................................................................     Companies: White House Confirms Contact With Enron Chief --- Fleischer Says Lay Rebuffed; Auditor Destroyed Documents  Dow Jones Newswires    01/11/2002  The Wall Street Journal Europe   UK4  (Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)     WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration has confirmed that Kenneth L. Lay, chairman and chief executive of Enron Corp., contacted two top officials last autumn and warned that the Houston energy trader was headed toward bankruptcy, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said.   He noted the government rebuffed Mr. Lay's appeal for help with Enron's financial situation. Mr. Fleischer previously told reporters Wednesday he wasn't aware of anyone in the White House who discussed Enron's finances.  Separately, Enron auditor Arthur Andersen LLP said in a statement Thursday that individuals at the firm \"disposed of a significant but undetermined amount\" of documents relating to its work for Enron. The documents, which include e-mail correspondence, had been sought by federal law-enforcement officials.   Arthur Andersen said it has notified the Justice Department, which has launched a criminal investigation into Enron, as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission. Enron was one of Andersen's largest clients, generating $25 million (28.1 million euros) a year in audit fees and $27 million of fees for consulting.   Arthur Andersen has asked former Sen. John Danforth to conduct \"an immediate and comprehensive review\" of the company's policies on document handling and recommend improvements.   The company said the destruction of the Enron documents occurred \"in recent months\" by individual employees involved in auditing Enron.   Michael Donovan, a Philadelphia attorney whose firm has filed a class-action lawsuit against Arthur Andersen on behalf of Enron shareholders, said document destruction by an audit firm is shocking.   \"Auditors save everything,\" including all work papers for audit clients, he added.   Meanwhile, Attorney General John Ashcroft and his chief of staff, David Ayres, recused themselves from the Justice Department's investigation of Enron, citing \"the totality of the circumstances of the relationship between Enron and the Attorney General.\"   The department's statement Thursday didn't elaborate further, but the Center for Responsive Politics, a group that tracks campaign-finance filings, said Enron and Mr. Lay made more than $50,000 in campaign contributions toward Mr. Ashcroft's bid for re-election to the Senate in 2000.   Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson will oversee the investigation in Mr. Ashcroft's absence, the Justice Department said.   Mr. Ashcroft's recusal is another indication of the company's ties with the Bush administration. Enron also contributed to President Bush's election campaign, and the White House has acknowledged that Vice President Richard Cheney or his aides met six times with Enron representatives on energy issues last year, with the final meeting held six days before the company's financial condition was revealed.   Earlier Thursday, President Bush said he wants to see a thorough investigation into the sudden collapse of Enron, and has ordered a review of the U.S. laws governing pensions. The president's comments came during a hastily arranged event in the Oval Office as the political heat mounted over Enron's collapse.   Mr. Fleischer said: \"What was told to me this morning was [Treasury] Secretary Paul O'Neill said that he had been contacted by Mr. Lay in the fall of last year, and Mr. Lay brought to the secretary's attention his concerns about whether or not Enron would be able to meet its obligations. And he expressed his concern about the experience that Long-Term Capital Management went through when the hedge-fund firm went bankrupt.    .....................................................................................................................................     Foreign News  Enron affair explodes around White House  Rupert Cornwell in Washington    01/11/2002  The Independent - London   FINAL  12  (Copyright 2002 Independent Newspapers (UK) Limited)     THE ENRON affair exploded around the Bush presidency last night, as his administration's top legal officer was forced to remove himself from the newly launched criminal investigation and the accounting firm that audited the failed energy giant's books admitted it had destroyed thousands of documents relating to the case.   Yesterday, the White House shifted into full scandal defence mode. Mr Bush intervened in the affair directly for the first time, ordering the Treasury Department to review federal pension regulations. He also denied he had ever discussed the company's difficulties with Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman and a long-time friend and benefactor of the President.  An especially shocking aspect of the Enron debacle has been how senior executives were able to cash in up to $1bn (pounds 700m) of Enron stock and options in the 18 months before the company began to unravel last autumn - while many employees, obliged to hold stock in pensions schemes, saw retirement funds virtually wiped out.   Already, civil suits have been filed against 29 Enron directors and executives, charging they sold shares while knowing the company was in dire trouble. The Justice Department inquiry will examine whether Enron, in the last few years, was no more than a giant fraud.   It was disclosure of unreported debts shielded by secret partnerships run by senior Enron executives, and its October admission that it had overstated its profits by $586m in the previous four years, that created the crisis of investor confidence that drove Enron into bankruptcy at the start of December. In the process, what was once the seventh-largest US corporation saw its shares plunge from $85 to under $1 apiece, in the largest corporate collapse in world history.   Last night, Andersen, Enron's accountants, stunned the US financial community by revealing its employees had destroyed a \"significant\" number of paper and electronic documents relating to its audit had been destroyed. The Securities and Exchange Commission, Wall Street's top regulatory body, described the admission as an \"extremely serious matter\".   In a separate embarrassment for Mr Bush, Attorney General John Ashcroft, head of the Justice Department and thus the country's top law enforcement official, announced he would have no involvement in the investigation. Mr Ashcroft reportedly accepted up to $60,000 to help his failed 2000 Senate campaign.   In the short term, the probe could take some of the sting out of the Congressional hearings due to start next month into the collapse. Scheduled witnesses, including Mr Lay and other senior executives, are likely to be the object of the federal investigation and under threat of criminal indictment, they may be able to say little to interrogators on Capitol Hill.   Even so, the once-close relationship between Mr Lay and Mr Bush will come under ever-fiercer scrutiny. Denying he had ever discussed Enron's finances with Mr Lay, Mr Bush said he had not seen him since last May. He expressed \"great concern\" for the people who had entrusted their money to Enron, and then \"for whatever reason, based upon some rule or regulation, got trapped in this awful bankruptcy\".   The real target for Democrats will be the large donations Enron made to the Republican party, including more than $100,000 to Mr Bush's election campaign, and a similar contribution to his inaugural gala.    .....................................................................................................................................     Foreign News  Bush snared as Enron becomes criminal case  Rupert Cornwell in Washington    01/11/2002  The Independent - London   FOREIGN  12  (Copyright 2002 Independent Newspapers (UK) Limited)     THE LAUNCH of a Justice Department criminal investigation into Enron, the energy conglomerate, has turned the biggest financial collapse in US history into a major, and probably long-lasting, embarrassment to President George Bush and his administration.   Yesterday, with the White House visibly shifting into defensive scandal mode, Mr Bush intervened in the affair directly for the first time, ordering the Treasury Department to review federal pension regulations.  An especially shocking aspect of the Enron debacle has been the way in which senior executives were able to cash up to $1bn (pounds 700m) of Enron stock and stock options in the 18 months before the company began to unravel last autumn - while many employees, obliged to hold stock in pensions schemes, in some cases saw these schemes virtually wiped out.   Already civil suits have been filed against 29 Enron directors and senior executives, charging that they sold shares while knowing the company was in dire trouble. The main focus of the government probe, however, will be the collapse itself - whether Enron committed criminal offences in concealing debt and misstating its financial position.   It was disclosure of unreported debts shielded by secret partnerships run by senior Enron executives, and its October admission that it had overstated its profits by $586m in the previous four years that created the crisis of investor confidence that drove Enron into bankruptcy at the start of December.   In the process, what was once the seventh-largest US corporation saw its shares plunge from $85 to under $1 apiece, wiping out the value of many of its employees' retirement funds. The Justice Department investigation, bringing together the work of federal prosecutors in California, New York and Enron's home base of Houston, will examine whether Enron in the last few years was no more than a giant fraud.   In the short term, the investigation could take some of the sting out of the Congressional hearings due to start next month into the collapse. Scheduled witnesses, including Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman and other senior executives, are likely to be the object of the federal investigation, so, under threat of criminal indictment, they may be able to say little to interrogators on Capitol Hill.   Even so, the once-close relationship between Mr Lay and the President will be subjected to ever-fiercer scrutiny. Questioned by reporters at a White House ceremony yesterday, Mr Bush denied he had ever discussed Enron's finances with Mr Lay, and said had not seen him since last May, at a charity event in Texas organised by his mother.   Mr Bush said he had \"great concern\" for the people who had entrusted their money to Enron, and then \"for whatever reason, based upon some rule or regulation, got trapped in this awful bankruptcy.\" But he tried to distance himself from the fellow Texan he used to call \"Kenny Boy,\" saying it was his predecessor, not he, who had appointed Mr Lay to the Texas Governor's Business Council.   But the real target for Democrats will be major political donations Enron made to Texas Republicans. Mr Lay and his company also gave more than $100,000 to Mr Bush's election campaign.   It has emerged that shortly before the collapse last autumn, Mr Lay spoke by phone with the Commerce Secretary, Don Evans, and Paul O'Neill, the Treasury Secretary, to warn them of Enron's problems.    .....................................................................................................................................   THE AMERICAS - Lifetime's savings lost in a corporate scandal.  By ALISON BEARD, SHEILA MCNULTY and ELIZABETH WINE.    01/11/2002  Financial Times   (c) 2002 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved     Few have been hit harder by Enron's bankruptcy than Tom Padgett.   The 59-year-old, who was only six months away from retiring, saw his assets fall from $615,000 to $11,000.  He was a victim of Enron's questionable accounting to hide debts. The energy trading company, a favourite of investors and analysts, filed for the largest corporate bankruptcy in US history in December.   Thornton House, 51, and his wife, Barbara House, 54, had $430,000 in retirement savings tied up in Enron. Mr House worked for the company for 20 years until 1993. Ms House left in 1991 after 13 years with the company.   \"Both of us lost a chunk,\" Mr House said. \"We believed in the company. We believed in Ken Lay (Enron's chairman and chief executive). We were all duped by them.   \"I may have to go back to look for work. Now there are 4,000 former Enron employees looking for these jobs.\"   The problems centred on Enron's 401(k) employee retirement programme. 401(k) accounts are employee-directed investment accounts that companies help fund and administer.   Enron's programme, worth about $2.1bn a year ago, was 60 per cent invested in the company's own stock, and employees were prevented from selling even as shares plummeted.   President George W. Bush has now promised that in the investigation he ordered yesterday the Treasury Department will \"come up with recommendations on how...to make sure that people are not exposed to losing their life savings\".   In an effort to prevent another scandal of this magnitude, a working group on financial markets, which includes members of the Securities and Exchange   Commission, Treasury Department, Federal Reserve and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, will review disclosure rules to make sure the American stockholder is protected.   All this comes too late for Enron's employees. Robin Harrison, counsel in the 401(k) plan participants class action lawsuit, said: \"The people who worked for the company the longest are the people the most hurt. They have the least amount of time to recoup their lost savings.\"   However, pension fund reform could be the silver lining to the company's collapse. In particular, industry experts hope that the Bush administration and Congressional investigations will change the law that exempts company shares from the diversification rules applied to all other retirement account holdings.   \"They can look all they want at making more disclosure to employees, or exhorting them to diversify, but the bottom line is the way the law is structured, it encourages companies to load people up on company stock,\" said Eli Gottesdiener, one of the attorneys representing Enron's 401(k) participants.   \"People will not police themselves because they want to show loyalty by loading up on company stock. It's another disaster waiting to happen and it needs to be stopped. There is only one way to do it.\"   Democratic Senators Barbara Boxer and Jon Corzine have already introduced legislation that would cap the amount of company stock in pension funds at 20 per cent.   Another important reform would be to prevent companies from setting restrictions on when and how much company stock employees can sell from their retirement plans, said David Certner, director of federal affairs at AARP, the non-partisan retirees lobbying group. In Enron's case, employees could not sell until they were 50.   \"Everything Enron put in had to go into company stock,\" Mr Padgett said. \"The lesson is, 'Don't trust your company'.\"   (c) Copyright Financial Times Ltd.

National Desk; Section A  ENRON'S COLLAPSE: NEWS ANALYSIS  A Familiar Capital Script  By DON VAN NATTA Jr.    01/11/2002  The New York Times   Page 1, Column 4  c. 2002 New York Times Company     WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 -- The rapidly exploding Enron inquiry presents elements reminiscent of earlier Washington scandals, including carefully phrased denials and accusations of easy access. And in a matter of hours today, it sent the White House into a full-scale effort to contain the potential damage to President Bush at a time when he wants to focus on the war on terrorism and the flagging economy.   The White House spent much of the day trying to distance the president from a torrent of bad news about the fall of Enron, the Houston energy conglomerate.  Although no one has suggested that Mr. Bush has done anything wrong, the connections between his presidency and Enron are uncomfortably close. The company's chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, has been a close friend of Mr. Bush for many years, and Mr. Lay and other Enron executives have contributed more money to Mr. Bush over his political career than anyone else, an amount exceeding $550,000. Mr. Lay contributed an additional $100,000 for the Bush inaugural committee.   Those connections were made vividly clear today when the White House disclosed that Mr. Lay discussed his company's precarious financial condition last fall with Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and sought assistance from Mr. Bush's best friend and presidential campaign chairman, Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans.   Throughout the day, White House officials denied that Mr. Bush had been aware of the company's troublesome finances or had ever been asked to come to its rescue.   But on Capitol Hill, Democrats were already beginning to ask of the president, ''What did he know and when did he know it?'' And questions were being raised about whether a criminal inquiry into Enron's collapse should be led by a special counsel rather than by the Justice Department, because Attorney General John Ashcroft received $57,499 in campaign contributions from Enron and Mr. Lay, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.   Mr. Ashcroft, as well as his chief of staff, recused themselves from the criminal investigation, which will try to determine whether the company or its executives committed fraud before it went bankrupt. But critics still questioned whether the Justice Department, which includes many other political appointees, could independently investigate the company.   Just as Enron's collapse was stunning because it occurred so quickly and so completely, the latest disclosures have reawakened Washington's scandal machinery, which had been practically dormant since Sept. 11. The capital may once again face months, if not years, of yet another investigation of the White House featuring the volatile mix of money, influence, access and politics.   Elements of a classic political scandal are here: A Texas corporation, led by Mr. Bush's most generous campaign contributor, files the largest bankruptcy petition in American history. A handful of executives are able to sell $1 billion worth of the company's stock before its collapse, but thousands of employees are barred from selling, losing their life's savings and retirement accounts.   And just this week, the White House disclosed that Enron executives, and the company chairman, had meetings and discussions with cabinet members, White House officials and Vice President Dick Cheney before and during the corporation's implosion.   On top of everything else, the accounting firm that audited Enron's books, Arthur Andersen LLP, disclosed today that a ''significant but undetermined'' number of documents related to the company had been destroyed.   ''This is the perfect storm,'' said Philip M. Schiliro, the chief of staff for Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California. ''It's the biggest bankruptcy in American corporate history, a bankruptcy where a small number of executives enriched themselves to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars while thousands of employees were left with worthless stock. And in 2001, Enron is the most influential company in Washington. When you piece it all together, there are many questions that need to be answered.''   President Bush said today that he had never discussed Enron's financial woes with Mr. Lay, who has supported Mr. Bush politically since his unsuccessful campaign for Congress in 1978. Mr. Bush said he last saw Mr. Lay in Texas at an April 30 fund-raiser for the literacy foundation of the former first lady Barbara Bush. At the time, Enron's price per share was nearly $60; its closing price today was 67 cents.   On Capitol Hill, Republicans and Democrats alike have pledged to work together to get to the bottom of the matter. Some Democratic officials also expressed glee that questions about White House influence peddling seemed to be emerging as a major political story of 2002.   ''If their goal was to give this story a head of steam, they have succeeded,'' Jennifer Palmieri, the press secretary of the Democratic National Committee, said of the White House's handling of the Enron matter. ''I think they are very spooked by this.''   Five Congressional committees have sent out subpoenas on the matter. The first of many hearings expected this year is set for Jan. 24 by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, which is headed by Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, who may be thinking of running for president in 2004.   Several congressmen demanded again today that the White House release records of all its contacts with Enron executives, including telephone and e-mail messages.   ''In contrast to the six contacts the White House disclosed,'' Mr. Waxman said, ''I suspect there were dozens of conversations between administration officials and Enron representatives during the past year. The public and Congress should have this information, especially since it is now clear the White House had knowledge that Enron was likely to collapse but did nothing to try to protect innocent employees and shareholders who ultimately lost their life savings.''   Political operatives and advocates of campaign finance reform said the Enron matter's staying power would depend in large measure on how the administration handled it in the coming days and weeks.   ''The Enron scandal clearly moved to a new stage today,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a public policy group, ''and it has reached a point where it will now demand serious national attention.''   Just as the Congressional committees and the news media are gearing up for what promises to be an inquiry that could last months, if not years, the principals have hired lawyers with golden tongues and lengthy experience in dealing with scandals.   David Boies, a leading trial lawyer, represents Andrew S. Fastow, Enron's former chief financial officer. W. Neil Eggleston, a prominent Washington lawyer, represents Enron's outside directors.   And Robert S. Bennett, the Washington lawyer who represented President Bill Clinton in the Paula Jones matter, is now Enron's lead Washington lawyer.   Mr. Bennett said today that he welcomed the criminal inquiry because it would ''bring light to the facts.'' But he also warned that the Congressional inquiries could easily degenerate into a ''circus atmosphere.''    Photos: Among the lawyers hired: Robert S.

National Desk; Section A  ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE OVERVIEW  ENRON CONTACTED 2 CABINET OFFICERS BEFORE COLLAPSING  By ELISABETH BUMILLER    01/11/2002  The New York Times   Page 1, Column 6  c. 2002 New York Times Company     WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 -- The White House disclosed today that Kenneth L. Lay, the chairman of the Enron Corporation and one of President Bush's biggest political contributors, telephoned two cabinet officers last fall, and one of them said Mr. Lay had sought government help with its dire financial condition.   Both said they declined to offer government aid.  In a day of rapid-fire developments, Attorney General John Ashcroft excused himself from all matters involving Enron because of campaign contributions he received from it.   In addition, Enron's auditors said they had destroyed numerous company documents and electronic communications. [Page C1.]   The Justice Department said on Wednesday that it had created a nationwide task force to conduct a criminal investigation into the collapse of Enron, an energy trading company with close ties to Mr. Bush and many top administration officials.   Today, the entire United States Attorney's office in Houston recused itself from the investigation, saying many of its approximately 100 lawyers, including the chief prosecutor, Michael T. Shelby, had family or other relationships with people affected by Enron's filing on Dec. 2 for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy law.   The White House moved quickly to contain the damage. The White House spokesman said Mr. Bush was made aware of the phone calls to the cabinet members only this morning during an Oval Office meeting.   ''What you have here is a case where a contributor called up and asked for something but did not get it,'' said Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary.   Yet the two cabinet secretaries who received calls from Mr. Lay described somewhat different conversations. Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans said that Mr. Lay had indicated he would welcome any government help with its bond ratings, while Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said the Enron chairman requested no assistance at all.   Enron officials disputed the White House version of events this evening and said Mr. Lay was not asking for assistance from the Bush administration in calling Mr. O'Neill and Mr. Evans, Mr. Bush's presidential campaign chairman and chief fund-raiser. Enron officials also said Mr. Lay had called Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, to alert him to the company's problems.   Mr. Lay was simply informing the government about the possible bankruptcy filing of the nation's seventh largest company, Enron officials said, as has been the practice of executives of other large companies whose collapse could affect worldwide financial markets.   ''He did not ask for anything,'' said Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman.   Enron's troubles and its numerous links to the Bush administration threatened to consume the president's time and attention even as he enjoys high approval ratings for his conduct of the war on terrorism.   As morning newspapers announced the expanding Justice Department investigation today, Mr. Bush summoned reporters to the Oval Office to declare that he had instructed his economic advisers to develop a plan to protect workers' pensions from similar corporate failures. Thousands of Enron employees lost their life savings and much of their retirement accounts when the company's stock became virtually worthless last November.   Enron's auditor, the giant accounting firm Arthur Andersen, then said that it had destroyed a ''significant'' volume of documents related to Enron. The firm said it was still gathering information about the episode before deciding if it would discipline the employees involved.   The Securities and Exchange Commission, which is investigating both Enron's collapse and Andersen's conduct, said its inquiry would be expanded to include the destruction of documents, in addition to looking into whether it had created off-the-books private partnerships that disguised the true financial condition of the company.   Almost simultaneously, Attorney General Ashcroft said he was recusing himself from oversight of the criminal investigation of the company's collapse because of his relationship with Enron. Common Cause reported today that a canvass of federal election records showed that Mr. Ashcroft had received a total of $54,499 from the company and Mr. Lay for his 2000 Senate campaign.   Enron, which pioneered deregulation of the nation's power business and grew to be one of the world's largest energy companies before its sudden fall, has long nurtured close ties to Mr. Bush. But in the Oval Office today, the president went to some length to distance himself from Mr. Lay, who he said had been a supporter of Governor Ann Richards of Texas when Mr. Bush defeated her in 1994.   ''And she named him the head of the Governor's Business Council,'' Mr. Bush said. ''And I decided to leave him in place, just for the sake of continuity. And that's when I first got to know Ken and worked with Ken.''   Mr. Bush said that he had never discussed the financial problems of Enron with Mr. Lay and that he had last seen him in the spring, at a fund-raising event in Houston. Mr. Fleischer said Mr. Bush had not talked to Mr. Lay since the spring.   It was Mr. Fleischer who first told reporters this morning, almost as an afterthought at a sparsely attended early news briefing, that Mr. Lay had called both Mr. O'Neill and Mr. Evans last fall to alert them about the company's financial straits.   Officials at the Treasury and Commerce Departments said Mr. Lay had spoken to Mr. O'Neill about Enron's condition on Oct. 28 and Nov. 8 and had spoken to Mr. Evans on Oct. 29. Although Mr. Lay had maintained until late October an optimistic public face about Enron's future, on Oct. 16 the company reported a third-quarter net loss of $618 million. On the same day, Moody's Investors Service announced that Enron's long-term debt obligations were on review.   The dates of the calls and the announcements of the bad financial news about the company are significant. If Mr. Lay had made the calls earlier in October, before the state of the company was widely known, the Bush administration would have been aware of the true condition of Enron while Mr. Lay was promoting a different story on Wall Street.   In an interview on CNBC tonight, Mr. O'Neill said Mr. Lay had not asked for a government bailout or other intervention to save the company.   ''He called me to advise me that Enron's problems were mounting and to offer access for our technical people to talk with his technical people about the contracts that they had that were causing them problems,'' Mr. O'Neill said. ''I subsequently asked the undersecretary of the Treasury to speak with the Enron people, which he did, so that we could satisfy ourselves that the Enron affairs were not going to have a negative impact on U.S. capital markets.''   Asked whether Mr. Lay asked for government assistance, Mr. O'Neill said ''Absolutely not.''   On the same CNBC program, Mr. Evans said Mr. Lay had told him that Moody's Investors Service was likely downgrade its rating of the company's debt.   Mr. Lay then said that if there was anything Mr. Evans could do to help the company deal with Moody's ''we would welcome that.'' But, Mr. Evans added, Mr. Lay did not ask him specifically to intervene with Moody's.   ''I listened to him and listened to their condition and listened to the issues he wanted to raise,'' Mr. Evans said. ''Subsequent to that I talked to Secretary O'Neill and told him I had the call. It was a pretty easy decision to make. I don't think there was anything for us to do. Secretary O'Neill agreed with me there was not so we didn't do anything.''   A Commerce Department official said today that in Mr. Lay's call with Mr. Evans, ''there was no information discussed that wasn't already in the public domain.''   Mr. Fleischer said that Mr. Bush was first told this morning in the Oval Office by Mr. O'Neill and Mr. Evans that Mr. Lay had made the calls to them and that they had not been willing to intervene to help. The president then told Mr. O'Neill and Mr. Evans, according to Mr. Fleischer's account, ''You did the right thing.''   Mr. Fleischer said the president expressed no surprise, regret or annoyance that he had not been informed of the calls from Mr. Lay until more than two months after they occurred.   ''Bankruptcies happen in our economy,'' Mr. Fleischer said. ''And it's not uncommon for people who are in the community, business community or in the labor community, to talk to a cabinet secretary to tell them about the financial status of their business and it ends there.''   Democrats on Capitol Hill moved immediately to question the White House statements. ''It is now clear the White House had knowledge that Enron was likely to collapse but did nothing to try to protect innocent employees and shareholders who ultimately lost their life savings,'' said Representative Henry A. Waxman, the California Democrat who is his party's senior member on the House Government Reform Committee.   Mr. Fleischer said that he hoped that any Congressional inquiry would be even-handed and that if it became ''a one-party witch hunt, I think the Congress is going again to remind the country on why people soured and tired of those types of partisan investigations.''   Mr. Lay and Enron executives have given more than $550,000 to Mr. Bush's various campaigns, and Mr. Lay also gave $100,000 to Mr. Bush's inaugural committee.   But Mr. Lay does not appear to have been a frequent recent visitor to the White House, based on publicly available records. He visited the White House only twice during the first five months of Mr. Bush's presidency, according to Secret Service access control records obtained by The New York Times under the Freedom of Information Act. The first visit occurred on Feb. 22, 2001, the day Enron officials met with the staff of Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force.   The second visit, the records show, was on April 17, the day Mr. Lay and other Enron officials met with Mr. Cheney for about a half-hour. Enron officials freely discussed the meeting last year with reporters, providing a copy of the memorandum on electricity issues the company presented to Mr. Cheney.   One month later, Mr. Cheney's energy policy task force issued its final report. In the section on deregulation of the electricity markets, the report's recommendations resembled much of what Enron had advocated. They also tracked with policies advocated by Mr. Bush during the 2000 presidential campaign.   Mr. Cheney, in an interview last year, denied that Enron had improperly influenced the task force's deliberations, saying the task force would ''make decisions based on what we think makes sound public policy,'' not what ''Enron thinks.''

In the latest revelation in the collapse of Enron, Arthur Andersen disclosed to federal agencies investigating the energy trading firm that individuals at the accounting firm in recent months disposed of \"a significant but undetermined number\" of documents related to its work for Enron.  The terse announcement left many questions unanswered. Who disposed of the documents and how? Why? Did it happen after investigations began?   In any event, the disclosure appeared likely to further damage the already-tarnished reputation of the nation's fifth-largest accounting firm. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which is investigating Enron, said destruction of documents is \"an extremely serious matter.\"   Andersen officials were called late last year to testify to a congressional committee about why the firm failed to detect the financial woes that contributed to Enron's downfall. The Justice Department said this week that it had formed a task force to pursue a criminal investigation of Enron. A department spokesman wouldn't say whether the agency knew of document destruction or whether Andersen was a target of criminal investigation.   Andersen's disclosure will increase pressure on the firm to fully disclose its handling of the Enron account. Dec. 12 congressional testimony by Joseph F. Berardino, Andersen's managing partner and chief executive officer, may have mischaracterized part of one Enron deal and understated Andersen's knowledge about it, people familiar with the matter say. Andersen says the testimony was truthful but based on incomplete information.   White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said yesterday he had no knowledge that the Bush administration got advance word from Andersen of the document destruction. But President Bush called for a government review of the Enron case, amid disclosure that Enron chief Kenneth Lay lobbied two cabinet secretaries for help as the company was nearing bankruptcy court. Mr. Lay also contacted Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan around the same time, a Fed spokesman confirmed.   Yesterday, Attorney General John Ashcroft said he had recused himself from the Justice Department's investigation of Enron, citing a conflict of interest. In addition, the Justice Department said much of the U.S. attorney's office in Houston would be recused because of family ties.   In Houston, an Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on Andersen's document disposal, other than to say that the accounting firm's announcement was the first Enron had heard about it. The spokeswoman added, \"We are not aware of the shredding of any documents that are part of any inquiry, investigation or litigation matter.\"   For Andersen, the Enron mess could hardly come at a worse time. In recent years, the firm has approved the financial statements of a series of its high-profile corporate clients, including Sunbeam Corp. and Waste Management Inc., that later proved to be false. Andersen paid tens of millions of dollars in damages to each company's shareholders, without admitting wrongdoing in either case. The deepening investigation into Enron could make it harder for Andersen to attract new clients and seems sure to distract top executives for a time.   Andersen said it asked former Sen. John Danforth, a Missouri Republican, \"to conduct an immediate and comprehensive review of Andersen's records management policy\" and to \"advise the firm to ensure that all appropriate remedial and disciplinary actions have been taken.\"   While Andersen has defended its audits of Enron, critics say the firm failed to identify a number of questionable accounting practices by Enron that contributed to its abrupt downfall. Once the dominant player in energy trading, the Houston company had to file for bankruptcy-court protection after a series of disclosures.   Enron had transactions with certain partnerships that were run by its own officers -- including its chief financial officer at the time, Andrew Fastow -- but that were treated by Enron as separate. It offered only murky and fragmented information about the partnerships. One of them, whose existence Enron didn't disclose for four years, was part of an arrangement that inflated earnings by several hundred million dollars.   And Enron's debt level was much higher than it revealed, thanks to the partnerships, which allowed Enron to keep some debt off its books. In November, a restatement by Enron of its financial results -- which Andersen had approved as accurate -- resulted in lowering Enron's reported earnings for the prior four years by $586 million, or 20%. Enron said its previous financial statements for those years could no longer be relied upon.   Among issues investigators now will doubtless probe is how many and which Enron-related documents were destroyed, and who destroyed them. Andersen said \"individuals\" had disposed of \"a significant but undetermined number of electronic and paper documents and correspondence.\" It added, \"Millions of documents related to Enron still exist, and the firm has successfully retrieved some of the deleted electronic files. The firm is continuing retrieval efforts through electronic backup files, and is continuing in its efforts to fully learn and understand all the facts related to this issue.\"   Another issue will be when the documents were destroyed. The firm said it had a policy -- now suspended -- that \"required in certain circumstances the destruction of certain types of documents.\" Many big corporations have similar policies specifying how long employees must retain certain categories of records.   Under prevailing regulations, auditors are required to \"adopt reasonable procedures for safe custody\" of their working papers and should keep them for long enough \"to satisfy any pertinent legal requirements of records retention.\" People with knowledge of the Justice Department's Enron probe said Andersen didn't destroy any audit working papers.   The destruction of documents would be especially troubling to investigators and regulators if some of it occurred after they had begun their inquiries into Enron's downfall. That would raise the question of whether the action was designed to thwart investigators. Andersen said it had confirmed that certain Enron-related documents were destroyed \"during the months before\" the SEC issued a subpoena to Andersen. It said it hadn't determined whether any were destroyed after the subpoena, but said it had told personnel after the subpoena arrived to preserve Enron-related documents.   Andersen's revelation about document disposal could raise embarrassing questions for Deloitte & Touche LLP, which this month released results of a \"peer review\" of Andersen's system of accounting and auditing quality. The review -- which focused on the firm's practices generally and not on its handling of Enron -- concluded that Andersen's system of accounting and auditing quality provided \"reasonable assurance of compliance with professional standards.\"   A Deloitte official said that the firm's peer review of Andersen included an evaluation of the firm's Houston office, which handled Enron's audits, but that Deloitte wasn't permitted to include Andersen's audit work for Enron because of pending litigation. Neither Deloitte nor Andersen would comment on whether the review would be reopened.   The unfolding Enron saga could have a detrimental effect overall on Andersen, which employs 85,000 people in 84 countries and last year had U.S. revenue of $9.3 billion. As with all accounting firms, Andersen's ability to attract and retain audit clients depends on having a sterling reputation. The more its reputation comes into question, the more likely it becomes that investors will view an audit opinion by Andersen with skepticism, prompting some clients to switch to other auditors.   There is no evidence that has happened so far. Asked whether Andersen has been told by any clients that they are switching to other auditors, spokesman David Tabolt said, \"Some have been concerned. Some have been supportive. I just don't think that we know yet how people are going to react, but we certainly hope that people will be understanding.\" More than a dozen companies that use Andersen as their auditor declined to comment on whether they might review their relationship.   Andersen also has taken heat over its audit of the Baptist Foundation of Arizona. Arizona state authorities are seeking as much as $600 million in restitution from the firm. They are also seeking to place Andersen on probation in the state, which could include restrictions and heightened monitoring.   Two of the Andersen auditors involved have invoked their Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination in civil suits brought in that case. They include one who also was Andersen's lead engagement partner for Lincoln Savings & Loan, the failed thrift once headed by Charles Keating.   Andersen has said it is cooperating with Arizona officials investigating its audits for the foundation, which filed for bankruptcy protection two years ago, shortly after Andersen left the account in mid-1999.   ---   Michael Schroeder and Rebecca Smith contributed to this article.    .....................................................................................................................................     Title Page  Enron accountants `destroyed papers'  Rupert Cornwell in Washington    01/11/2002  The Independent - London   FINAL  1  (Copyright 2002 Independent Newspapers (UK) Limited)     THE ACCOUNTING firm Andersen last night admitted destroying audit documents relating to the collapse of the American energy giant Enron.   Less than a day after the Justice Department announced a criminal probe into America's biggest ever corporate failure, Andersen stunned the US political and financial community by saying that its employees had \"disposed of or deleted\" several documents relating to its audit work.  The documents are said to have been destroyed over the summer and autumn, before Enron's swift slide into bankruptcy in December.   Enron was a major longtime backer of President George Bush and the Republican Party, and its failure is shaping up as the biggest potential scandal yet to threaten the Bush administration.   The Securities and Exchange Commission, the Wall Street watchdog, said the disappearance of the documents was an \"extremely serious matter\".    .....................................................................................................................................     White House Reveals Enron Contacts  By RON FOURNIER  AP White House Correspondent    01/11/2002  AP Online   Copyright 2002 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.     WASHINGTON (AP) - The White House revealed on Thursday that Enron Corp., an energy firm closely tied to President Bush, sought the administration's help shortly before collapsing with the life savings of many workers. In a separate disclosure, the company's auditors said they had destroyed many Enron documents.   In the rapid swirl of events, each one raising questions about potential conflicts of interest, Attorney General John Ashcroft disqualified himself from the criminal inquiry into Enron's conduct. The company donated thousands of dollars to Ashcroft's Senate campaign in 2000.  Bush, whose own political career has benefited from Enron contributions, pledged to aggressively pursue the investigation into whether the Texas-based firm defrauded investors, including 401(k) plan investors, by concealing vital information about its finances.   \"Ken Lay is a supporter,\" the president said of Enron chairman Kenneth L. Lay. \"But what anybody's going to find is that this administration will fully investigate issues, such as the Enron bankruptcy, to make sure we can learn from the past and make sure that workers are protected.\"   Enron's bankruptcy, already the subject of criminal, civil and congressional investigations, threatens to pull the White House into a political quagmire even as Bush's approval ratings reach near-record levels because of the war against terrorism.   \"It is now clear the White House had knowledge that Enron was likely to collapse but did nothing to try to protect innocent employees and shareholders who ultimately lost their life savings,\" said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif.   Firing back, Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer urged Democrats to avoid \"partisan witch hunts, endless investigations or fishing expeditions.\" Democrats hope to make a political issue out of the administration's many ties to Enron.   The bankruptcy has forced White House officials to face questions once posed to the scandal-tainted Clinton White House.   Would Bush support naming a special prosecutor to investigate? Fleischer said no. He also said he did not know any White House aides who had hired lawyers.   And there was a development reminiscent of Clinton's Whitewater: missing documents.   The firm that audited Enron's books, Arthur Andersen LLP, notified investigators that it had destroyed a \"significant but undetermined\" number of documents related to the company.   As for the company's contacts last fall, administration officials said Commerce Secretary Donald Evans and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill received calls from Lay seeking help for his company. Lay told Evans he would welcome any support in helping the company deal with a bond-rating firm that was considering downgrading Enron, administration officials said.   In the conversation with O'Neill, Lay discussed a past example in which the Federal Reserve pressured several large financial institutions to bail out a Connecticut hedge fund.   Administration officials said O'Neill and Evans took no action to help Enron.   On two other occasions, Lay called to discuss an Enron energy project in India and did not mention Enron's financial troubles, officials said.   The calls came after investors and the general public learned of the extent of Enron's problems, when the company posted major losses Oct. 16.   Enron filed for bankruptcy Dec. 2, after months of speculation about its finances.   Administration officials dismissed suggestions that Evans or O'Neill should have disclosed Enron's troubles as soon as they were brought to their attention last fall. That might have given more notice to investors about to lose their savings.   \"This is not the first bankruptcy and will not be the last bankruptcy\" in America, Fleischer said.   Other aides said Enron's problems were well known at the time of the telephone calls, and the administration's duty was to make sure troubles at Enron didn't have a broader economic impact.   Bush raised nearly $114,000 in political action committee money and individual donations from Enron during the presidential campaign, making the company one of his biggest financial supporters. In addition, Enron gave tens of thousands of dollars to Bush's two gubernatorial campaigns in Texas.   Independent analysts show that Enron employee donated nearly $800,000 from 1999 to 2001 to Bush, members of Congress and both parties. The bulk went to GOP causes.   With criticism mounting, Bush summoned economic advisers to the Oval Office and announced a review of federal rules on pension security and financial disclosure by companies.   \"There have been a wave of bankruptcies that have caused many workers to lose their pensions and that's deeply troubling to me,\" Bush said.   Bush offered the broad outlines of his six-year relationship with Lay, saying he had seen the businessman twice this year.   \"I have never discussed with Mr. Lay the financial problems of the company,\" Bush said. Fleischer said he knew of no White House aides who had.   Lay met with Vice President Dick Cheney or his aides six times last year before the release of the administration's energy plan.   Senior adviser Karl Rove, owned Enron stock at the beginning of Bush's term but sold it under federal ethics rules. Lindsey earned $50,000 from Enron for serving on a company board last year.   Four congressional committees are investigating Enron matters. In one inquiry, Senate investigators are issuing 51 subpoenas for documents from Enron's current and former directors and senior managers and from its auditing firm.    .....................................................................................................................................     Editorial Desk; Section A  The Enron Investigations    01/11/2002  The New York Times   Page 20, Column 1  c. 2002 New York Times Company     Washington is suddenly awash with investigations into the demise of Enron, as well it should be. The failure of the politically powerful energy trading company is the biggest corporate bankruptcy in the nation's history. Given the company's close ties to the Bush administration, and its generous campaign contributions to members of Congress, only an exacting and unflinching set of investigations can assure the country that Enron executives are not receiving special treatment from the government. So far, the White House is taking the right steps. We trust its determination will not flag in the months ahead, even if embarrassing questions come up about Enron's ties to the administration.   The Justice Department decision to create a special task force to determine whether to bring criminal charges against Enron or its officers appears to be a recognition of both the complexity and the importance of this case. Such task forces, based in Washington but involving prosecutors around the country, are usually reserved for potential crimes of national import, and this is certainly that. Thousands of unsuspecting Enron employees lost much of their retirement savings while company officials enriched themselves by dumping their stock before the plight of the company became known.  Placing the investigation directly under the control of the Justice Department's criminal division, however, can invite political interference by top administration officials. President Bush must ensure that that does not happen. Attorney General John Ashcroft and his chief of staff properly recused themselves from Enron-related matters yesterday because Mr. Ashcroft received large contributions from the company while he was in the Senate. The company, long a prophet of deregulating energy markets, and its employees contributed about $800,000 to political candidates in the last two years.   Enron, based in Houston, has been the most generous corporate benefactor of George W. Bush throughout his political career. The president is now understandably eager to distance himself from the company, its scandal and its chairman, Kenneth Lay. The White House announced yesterday that Mr. Lay had telephoned Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Donald Evans last fall to inform them of his company's difficulties. Mr. Lay seemed to hint in these conversations at the possibility of government relief. The two cabinet members say they offered no assistance, but the planned Congressional hearings into the Enron scandal should explore the timing and content of these and all other contacts between the administration and Enron.   President Bush has directed Mr. O'Neill and others to review regulations affecting company pension plans and financial disclosures with an eye toward averting any future Enron-like debacles. Mr. Bush, however, must do more to show that he understands the full import of the Enron collapse. He should order Vice President Dick Cheney to be forthcoming with the details of the dealings Mr. Cheney's energy task force had with Enron executives last year. The White House disclosed earlier this week that Mr. Cheney or members of his task force had met with Enron officials six times. But so far, Mr. Cheney has not offered detailed information about the agenda of each meeting. He must now do so, in recognition that this is no longer about whether to succumb to the pestering of partisan Democrats on Capitol Hill. It is about reassuring millions of American investors whose confidence in the integrity of financial markets has been shaken.   Enron is the latest and most spectacular case of a financial implosion that involved accounting irregularities. Many other seeming high fliers eager to impress Wall Street and prop up their stock prices have had to restate erroneous earnings statements, raising questions about the oversight of the accounting profession. Arthur Andersen, Enron's supposedly independent auditor, announced yesterday that a significant number of its Enron-related documents had been destroyed. Andersen's failure to question the appropriateness of Enron's dealings with off-the-books partnerships run by its own officers should figure prominently in the Justice Department's and Securities and Exchange Commission's investigations.    .....................................................................................................................................     Business/Financial Desk; Section C  ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE PENSIONS  Bush Promises a Look at Employee Risks, but Experts Say Solutions Won't Be Easy  By DANIEL ALTMAN    01/11/2002  The New York Times   Page 4, Column 1  c. 2002 New York Times Company     Reacting to the destruction of the retirement savings of thousands of employees of the Enron Corporation, President Bush said yesterday that the administration would start looking at ways ''to make sure that people are not exposed to losing their life savings as a result of a bankruptcy.''   But without changes in law and corporate behavior, the White House may have a hard time reaching that goal.  Many Enron employees lost their retirement savings because the savings were tied up almost exclusively in company securities. Over half the funds in Enron's 401(k) plans for employees were invested in Enron's own shares.   That situation is by no means unique, said J. Mark Iwry, a former benefits tax counsel at the Treasury Department. Survey data suggest that more than 30 percent of assets are invested in company stock at those companies that allow their stock to be included in their 401(k) plans. And in companies like Enron, where management has some influence over how employee savings are invested, slightly over half the assets on average are in company stock.   Why, given the seemingly obvious benefits of diversification, would workers still end up putting so many nest eggs in the same basket?   By law, companies must offer several options for 401(k) plans. But unlike traditional pension plans, which cannot put more than 10 percent of their assets in any one company, the rules governing 401(k) plans do not set limits. And many companies give their employees big incentives to buy shares with their 401(k) contributions. Companies often match employee contributions only with stock and impose limits on how soon the shares can be sold.   Secretary of the Treasury Paul H. O'Neill said yesterday that he would consider ways to give American workers, more than 40 million of whom have money in 401(k) plans, more freedom to make investment decisions.   But Brigitte Madrian, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, said holders of 401(k) plans generally show little initiative. Most people stick with the default 401(k) plan set up by their company, even if that plan invests solely in the company's shares. And employees are unlikely to keep close tabs on their retirement savings, despite the possibility of a sudden collapse like Enron's. ''Most people aren't in the habit of tracking their 401(k) investments on a daily basis,'' she said.   The reasons employees buy their own companies' shares may go beyond company rules. People may simply be more confident in their employers than in the rest of the market. James Delaplane, vice president for retirement policy at the American Benefits Council, said that even though Enron employees had opportunities at certain times to diversify their savings, many still chose to invest heavily in the company's stock because of their loyalty to Enron and its past success.   Sometimes, colleagues' confidence is enough. ''Some employees felt social pressures to put even their own money into company stock,'' Ms. Madrian said. Those workers, she said, suffered the most when Enron's value crumbled.   Legislation has intensified such trends, according to Mr. Iwry. He cited tax deductions on dividend payments for shares bought through employee stock ownership plans. Such plans can also offer shares at a discount.   Mr. Iwry warned that measures taken to encourage diversification by employees might discourage companies from making matching contributions. A bill has already been introduced in the House that would limit the portion of a 401(k) plan that may be held in a company's own shares to 10 percent.   ''Legislative changes and regulatory changes can improve things,'' said Eric Lofgren, director of the benefits group at Watson Wyatt, a consulting firm, ''but they have to be really careful. It is possible for them to do more harm than good.''   Mr. Lofgren said education could encourage diversification. ''The risk of lack of diversification,'' he said, ''is certainly something you want to communicate to anyone who has the option of going into one stock.''   Mr. Delaplane said he also preferred educational steps by companies over legislation. He said some of the damage from Enron's collapse might have been avoided if its employees had received personal financial advice from independent consultants.   But such advice might not have taken account of the fact that Enron, for what it says were administrative reasons, did not allow employees to sell their stock in the 401(k) plan for a critical period when the stock price was falling. Top executives, by contrast, did not face the same restrictions on the shares they owned outside the 401(k) plan and those they had acquired through stock options.   Though 401(k) plans may receive the bulk of the attention in the Enron case, at least one authority on retirement saving hopes that Mr. Bush will consider the issue more broadly. ''The biggest need is to try to expand the coverage of the pension system,'' said James Poterba, an M.I.T. economics professor. ''That typically means trying to find ways to get smaller firms and lower-wage firms to adopt more systematic retirement arrangements.''   Mr. Bush also promised to focus attention more broadly on disclosure of financial information.   And Edmund L. Jenkins, chairman of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, said: ''It is important that we have transparency of information for investors. It's a natural reaction to a situation such as Enron's for questions to be asked in this area.''   But ''until we know what happened,'' Mr. Jenkins added, ''it's hard to know what to address.''    .....................................................................................................................................     Business/Financial Desk; Section C  ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE AUCTION  Enron's Energy Trading Business Draws Several Potential Buyers  By JONATHAN D. GLATER and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN    01/11/2002  The New York Times   Page 5, Column 1  c. 2002 New York Times Company     Lawyers for the Enron Corporation negotiated late into the night yesterday as they tried to extract the best deal from companies interested in buying its once-mighty energy trading business.   Several lawyers for companies monitoring the auction held, as part of Enron's bankruptcy proceedings, at the Midtown Manhattan offices of the law firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges said that at various points in the evening, different bidders seemed to be ahead, but that the negotiations were too close to call.  Citibank and UBS both submitted bids this week, BP was bidding for some portions of the business, and lawyers for Enron said that other companies had submitted informal bids this week.   ''The auction is continuing and is expected to go on possibly all night,'' Jeffrey McMahon, Enron's chief financial officer, said in a statement released late last night to placate reporters. ''We hope to have a conclusion and announcement Friday morning.''   Enron's flagship energy trading business bought and sold energy-related commodities like gas and electricity as well as more complex financial products to hedge against energy market risk. Included in the businesses for sale was its Internet trading operation, EnronOnline. Since Enron filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 2, the trading business has honored outstanding contracts but has not originated new transactions, according to its lawyers.   Any deal for the trading operations would not be final. Today, a federal bankruptcy judge is scheduled to approve the transaction, but several creditors have objected to different aspects of the sale in recent weeks. Lawyers for Enron said that if the hearing needs to be postponed, it will be.   It is unclear how much of a competitor the new trading business will be. For one thing, analysts and industry experts said that the trading business, to be operated by a joint venture with a new investor, would probably be more cautious than Enron was.   ''Enron's operations will probably be more conservatively run within the new structure, with another major investor being a major shareholder,'' said Gordon A. Howald, an energy analyst at Credit Lyonnais. The culture at a financial institution like Citibank or UBS is different from that at Enron, which at its heyday had a reputation for tolerating very high levels of risk, he said.   ''Enron, for example, was involved in a significant number of commodities that were not necessarily very liquid -- coal, metals,'' he said. By serving as a market-maker, Enron risked having to make good on a deal that another company failed to complete, at great potential cost.   Any buyers, Mr. Howald said, ''would have to seriously consider whether they would want to take on that added risk.''   Bidders have not necessarily proposed paying cash for Enron's trading operation, said Martin J. Bienenstock, a lawyer at Weil Gotshal, which represents Enron in its bankruptcy proceedings. Rather, the buyer would provide necessary financial backing and take an ownership stake in a joint venture that would own the trading business, which includes more than 500 employees and the software, computers and necessary facilities.   Over all, energy trading appears to have become more conservative since Enron's collapse. Traders are scrutinizing the financial health of their trading partners much more closely, said one executive involved in risk management at a major energy company that operates its own trading business.   The executive, who insisted that his name not be used in an article discussing Enron, said that some traders now require more collateral or have ''triggers'' in contracts, requiring other parties to provide more collateral under certain circumstances.   ''The whole industry is running itself differently,'' said Paul Patterson, an analyst who covers the energy industry for ABN Amro in New York. But the changes in trading practices did not cause Enron's demise, he added. ''What you really had was a run on the bank,'' he said.   The new trading business, for now known only by its acronym Netco, for New Energy Trading Company, will therefore not instantly become an energy trading powerhouse. It will have to regain the confidence of other energy traders.   Mr. Howald, the analyst, said that recovery would not come quickly. ''It's going to take a long time to get anywhere close to the volume they traded in the past,'' he said.    .....................................................................................................................................     Newscast: Latest developments in the Enron collapse just seem to be getting curiouser and curiouser    01/11/2002  Minnesota Public Radio: Marketplace Morning Report   (c) Copyright 2002, Minnesota Public Radio. All Rights Reserved.     KAI RYSSDAL, anchor: Good morning. I'm Kai Ryssdal in Los Angeles.   There's a line from \"Alice in Wonderland\" that, for my money, perfectly sums up the way things have been going in the Enron collapse. MARKETPLACE's John Dimsdale has the latest developments in a case that just seems to be getting curiouser and curiouser.  JOHN DIMSDALE reporting:   With regulators, lawmakers and law enforcement investigators trying to find out how a multibillion-dollar energy company crumbled like a house of cards, the firm that audited Enron's books says the financial history may never be complete. Arthur Andersen revealed that in recent months an undetermined number of Enron's documents and electronic files were destroyed or deleted. Andersen's role in Enron's collapse is already the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. The Bush administration's close ties to the Houston-based energy giant became clear yesterday when the White House revealed Enron's CEO discussed his company's financial problems with the Treasury and Commerce secretaries late last year.   President Bush announced a Cabinet level review of pension laws that were either violated or need to be changed. And finally, Attorney General John Ashcroft recused himself from the Justice Department's criminal investigation following revelations that his Senate campaign received contributions from Enron. In Washington, I'm John Dimsdale for MARKETPLACE.   RYSSDAL: As you might imagine with things being the way they are in Washington, the game of what did people know and when did they know it has already begun.    .....................................................................................................................................     News  Failing Enron sought help at White House  JENA HEATH  COX WASHINGTON BUREAU    01/11/2002  The Atlanta Journal-Constitution   Home  A.1  (Copyright, The Atlanta Journal and Constitution - 2002)     Washington --- Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay telephoned Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans last fall to warn them the nation's largest energy trader was headed for trouble and to seek their help, the White House disclosed Thursday.   It was the first public indication that high-level Bush administration officials knew the seriousness of the Houston-based company's financial woes before Dec. 2, when it filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history, wiping out the retirement savings of many of its employees.  In another development, the accounting firm that audited Enron's books, Arthur Anderson LLP, said its employees had destroyed \"a significant but undetermined\" number of documents related to Enron. The accounting firm had already been criticized for failing to detect irregularities.   Also Thursday, Attorney General John Ashcroft recused himself from a wide-ranging criminal investigation of Enron by the Justice Department, which he heads. Various news reports said Enron and Lay contributed thousands of dollars to Ashrcroft's unsuccessful Senate re-election campaign in 2000.   Meanwhile, President Bush announced the creation of a group to reform disclosure rules regarding pensions. Many Enron employees saw their 401(k) retirement savings evaporate after company officials banned them for a period of time from selling their plunging company stock.   \"Ken Lay is a supporter,\" the president said of Enron's chairman and one of his   biggest political backers. \"But what anybody's going to find is that this administration will fully investigate issues, such as the Enron bankruptcy, to make sure we can learn from the past and make sure that workers are protected.\"   Bush said he and Enron's chairman did not discuss the company's financial situation.   \"I have never discussed with Mr. Lay the financial problems of the company,\" Bush told reporters in the Oval Office. \"The last time that I saw Mr. Lay was at my mother's fund-raising event for literacy in Houston, that would have been last spring. I do know that Mr. Lay came to the White House early in my administration along with . . . 20 other business leaders to discuss the state of the economy.\"   Earlier in the day, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Lay called Treasury Secretary O'Neill in the fall expressing concern about Enron's financial health and fears that the company's problems could affect financial markets.   Fleischer said Lay brought up Long-Term Capital Management, one of the largest hedge funds in history and whose 1998 collapse was softened when 14 banks agreed to a bailout at the behest of the Federal Reserve. Asked if Lay wanted a bailout, Fleischer said: \"I don't characterize it one way or another.\"   \"What was told to me this morning was Secretary O'Neill said that he had been contacted by Mr. Lay in the fall of last year and Mr. Lay brought to the secretary's attention concerns about whether or not Enron would be able to meet its obligations, and he expressed his concern about the experience of Long-Term Capital,\" Fleischer said.   O'Neill assigned a deputy to review the Long-Term Capital case and concluded that a comparison \"was not apt,\" Fleischer said.   Lay called O'Neill on Oct. 28 and Nov. 8 after Enron reported an eye-popping $618 million third quarter loss.   \"Lay mentioned to the secretary that this might impact credit markets,\" Treasury Department spokeswoman Michele Davis said.   O'Neill, in an interview on CNN, said Treasury looked at the question of whether Enron's troubles posed a threat more broadly to U.S. credit markets and concluded it did not.   He dismissed suggestions that Enron was seeking a federal bailout.   \"If he wanted a giveaway from the government, he surely wouldn't have called me,\" O'Neill said. \"I don't know when we're inclined to make bailouts . . . for companies that have gotten themselves in trouble.\"   Lay called Commerce Secretary Evans on Oct. 26, in the days before Moody's Investor's Services was deciding whether to downgrade the Enron's credit rating. Evans returned the call on Oct. 29, the day after Lay called O'Neill.   Evans told CNN that Lay said, \"If there's any kind of support you could give us we would welcome that.\" Evans said he and O'Neill conferred and determined that no federal government response was in order.   Later, Evans told reporters at the White House that he did not discuss the decision with President Bush.   \"I didn't think he needed to know,\" said Evans. \"It was a pretty easy decision.\"   Enron's financial woes became public Oct. 16, when the company reported the $618 million loss. The next day, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced it was beginning an inquiry into transactions involving partnerships run by Enron's chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, who was ousted later in October.   In possibly the only positive development for Enron on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Lee Rosenthal refused to freeze more than $1 billion in Enron assets in response to a lawsuit filed against company executives by Amalgamated Bank and others. The lawsuit charges Enron executives profited illegally by selling millions of shares before the company collapsed.   The Justice Department announced a wide-ranging criminal probe of Enron's financial transactions Wednesday --- one of several investigations under way.   On Thursday, Ashcroft recused himself, citing \"the totality of the circumstances of the relationship between Enron and the attorney general,\" according to a Justice Department statement.   Ashcroft, a Missouri Republican, raised $57,499 for his failed 2000 Senate campaign from Enron; Lay gave $25,000 of the total. The Ashcroft Victory Committee raised another $25,000 in soft money directly from Enron, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics.   Four congressional committees are investigating Enron matters.   Those probes likely will be hampered by Andersen's announcement that electronic files and other documents related to its audit of Enron had been destroyed.   Andersen, in a statement, said its company policy \"required in certain circumstances the destruction of certain types of documents.\"   Millions of Enron documents still exist, the accounting firm said, and it has retrieved some of the deleted electronic files.   Andersen said it has asked John Danforth, former Missouri attorney general and U.S. senator, to conduct a review of the company's records management policy.   Rep. Billy Tauzin (R-La.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which is among those investigating Enron's actions, called the destruction of documents \"a deeply troubling development.\"   \"Anyone who destroyed records simply out of stupidity should be fired,\" Tauzin said. \"Anyone who destroyed records to try and subvert our investigation should be prosecuted.\"   Enron has deep political ties to Bush and key members of his administration.   The Bush presidential campaign received $74,200 in contributions from two dozen top current and former Enron executives and board members in the 2000 election cycle.   Lay also personally contributed $122,500 to Bush's campaigns for governor of Texas, according to a study by the nonpartisan Center for Public Integrity.   Lay and other Enron officials met six times with Vice President Dick Cheney or his aides last year, before and after the release of the administration's energy plan.   --- Washington correspondent Bob Deans contributed to this article.

Business/Financial Desk; Section C  ENRON'S COLLAPSE: THE BANK  Ties to Enron Leave Banker in an Awkward Spot  By RIVA D. ATLAS    01/11/2002  The New York Times   Page 1, Column 2  c. 2002 New York Times Company     Enron's collapse leaves Marc Shapiro of J. P. Morgan Chase in a difficult position.   As a vice chairman who oversees finance and risk management at the bank, Mr. Shapiro has had to repeatedly explain how the venerable New York institution came to have so much at stake. At last tally, the bank provided $2.6 billion to Enron, the giant energy trading company that fell into bankruptcy last month. The relationship went beyond traditional loans to a variety of complicated financings, including futures contracts involving offshore companies and debt backed by Enron's receivables.  Disclosures about the extent of that exposure have left J. P. Morgan's investors wondering if top management was fully aware of its Enron position before the company's demise. Even now, questions persist about whether there are more surprises to come for J. P. Morgan's investors.   Not only does Mr. Shapiro have to answer for the financial decisions, but he has to navigate a web of ties to Enron. A native of Houston, Enron's hometown, and a former chief executive of Texas Commerce, Mr. Shapiro has long moved in circles with Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chief executive. Mr. Lay was once a member of the board of Texas Commerce, a bank that was acquired by a predecessor of J. P. Morgan in 1987.   Mr. Lay has had ''a long professional relationship with Marc Shapiro and considers him a very good friend,'' said Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman.   A relationship with Enron was, until recently, quite prized on Wall Street, Mr. Shapiro said in a conference call with analysts last month. ''It is difficult to remember that four to five months ago, Enron was a very solid investment-grade company with a very positive reputation,'' he said. ''We and lots of other people had that belief.''   Even though $2.6 billion would be a manageable loss for Morgan, Mr. Shapiro, 54, may have more at stake personally. He was in the running for the top job at Morgan, which went to William B. Harrison Jr., 58. The Enron debacle -- as political pressures mount and criminal inquiries commence -- could prove to be an embarrassing coda on a highly successful career.   J. P. Morgan and the banks it acquired have led more than a third of Enron's bank financings since 1991, according to estimates by the Loan Pricing Corporation, a New York research firm. Citigroup led an estimated 45 percent of Enron's loans. The lending relationship probably helped J. P. Morgan gain other Enron business, including the role of merger adviser on the company's ill-fated plan to be acquired by Dynegy.   Recent lawsuits disclose that the bank engaged in some complicated financings on Enron's behalf.   On Dec. 11, J. P. Morgan filed a lawsuit demanding that Enron turn over $2.1 billion in assets tied to a financing that was backed by Enron receivables. J. P. Morgan has said that it is owed less than $100 million of this total, because it arranged the loan and then sold the rest to other investors.   A week later, the bank surprised investors by disclosing that it was owed nearly $1 billion from a group of insurance companies that had backed commodity contracts between J. P. Morgan and Enron. The insurers have refused to pay.   After it filed suit against the insurers in late December, J. P. Morgan said that its exposure to Enron totaled $2.6 billion. That was $1.7 billion greater than implied in a press release in November, as Enron's financial difficulties became apparent.   For many analysts, it was not the size of the exposure, but the sharp revision that unnerved them. ''J. P. Morgan has lost some credibility in its risk-management warning systems,'' wrote David Hendler, an analyst with CreditSights, a research firm that tracks the debt markets. ''We are not confident that the latest disclosures will be the final ones.''   The Enron situation is a rare embarrassment for Mr. Shapiro, who is well regarded by competitors and investors for his facility with numbers as well as his frankness. At just 29, he became chief financial officer of Texas Commerce.   Mr. Shapiro did not have direct responsibility for loans to Enron but appears to have taken an interest in the company's struggle for survival. On at least a couple of occasions last fall, he helped along rescue discussions, within the bank and with Dynegy executives, according to executives at J. P. Morgan and at Dynegy.   According to a recent article in The New York Observer, Mr. Shapiro called a J. P. Morgan investment banker in November and asked him to help the company find a savior. But according to officials at J. P. Morgan, that request was made not at the urging of Mr. Lay but of a Morgan banker in Houston who worked directly with Enron and who knew Mr. Shapiro.   Mr. Shapiro said such occasional involvement should not be surprising, or suspicious. ''As a leading financial institution, our executives have valuable relationships with many business leaders,'' he said. ''But that doesn't mean there's any difficulty in doing the right thing for our firm. You do what you need to do to protect the interests of the institution.''   Mr. Shapiro is probably taking a personal interest in the case, said Deborah Fiorito, who handles communications for Dynegy and who worked for Mr. Shapiro at Texas Commerce. ''Marc's interest in this transcends many levels,'' she said. ''He cares a lot about what happens to Houston. You can't say enough about the impact of this on the city.''   Mr. Lay served on the board of Texas Commerce because he was a major customer of the bank and because he had stature among Houston business executives.   ''I respected Ken Lay very much,'' said Ben Love, the longtime chief executive of Texas Commerce who hired and mentored Mr. Shapiro and asked Mr. Lay to join the bank's board. ''I am dumbfounded like everyone else'' about Enron's collapse, he said.   Mr. Shapiro's ties to Mr. Lay extended beyond the board of Texas Commerce. The men were involved in Houston politics and civic affairs, and they have served on a committee to help burnish the image of the University of Houston.   However ugly and embarrassing the Enron debacle may be, Mr. Shapiro emphasized to analysts last month that it was unlikely to cripple the bank. Of the $2.6 billion in loans outstanding to Enron, about a fourth, $620 million, is unsecured. Even if the bank loses all of the unsecured amount, that represents less than 1 percent of J. P. Morgan's $460 billion in corporate loans, derivatives, obligations and commitments at the end of the third quarter.   ''The way the information came out was unusual, but there was nothing sinister about it,'' said Thomas K. Brown, who runs Second Curve Capital, which invests in bank stocks. ''They just bungled. We all want neat answers, but in the world we live in, arrangements with large corporations are increasingly complex.''   Mr. Brown, who said he thought ''the world of Marc Shapiro,'' suggested that Mr. Shapiro's reputation would weather the Enron debacle. ''Bankruptcies of this size don't happen every day,'' he said.    Photo: Marc Shapiro, who oversees finance and risk management at J. P. Morgan Chase, has had to field many questions about Morgan's involvement with Enron, and about his personal ties to the company. (Justin Lane for The New York Times)   .....................................................................................................................................     Fall of an Energy Giant: Enron's Advisers Seek Higher Bids For Energy Unit  By Mitchell Pacelle and Jathon Sapsford  Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal    01/11/2002  The Wall Street Journal   A4  (Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)     Representatives of Enron Corp. and its creditors were still negotiating yesterday evening in an effort to coax the highest possible offer for parts of the company's once-powerful wholesale trading unit.   As of yesterday evening, the company hadn't yet selected a winning bid from multiple bidders. Among the bidders are two banks, Citigroup Inc. and UBS AG, and BP PLC, the London-based oil company. The company's advisers spent the day yesterday pressing bidders to improve their original offers.  Enron's advisers and creditors consider it a priority to try to get the energy-trading business, which still has a staff of about 1,000 people, up and running again. Enron's advisers had been aiming to find a creditworthy partner willing to take a 51% stake in the trading unit, which trades dozens of products and once accounted for the bulk of Enron's revenues.   The details of the bids submitted by Citigroup and UBS haven't been disclosed.   BP has said it offered $25 million for only the computer settlement support systems of the Enron unit, but that it hadn't submitted a bid for control of the whole unit. A BP spokesman reiterated yesterday, however, that if the bidding process set up by the bankruptcy court \"doesn't work out, we did express an interest in negotiating without commitment for other things.\"   The earliest Enron is expected to disclose a decision -- if it reaches one -- is at a hearing on the matter scheduled for New York federal bankruptcy court this morning. It remained unclear yesterday evening whether a deal would be cemented in time to present to the court. Alternatively, it is possible that Enron will ask the court for more time to negotiate, or announce that it had found none of the offers acceptable, one person involved in the process said.   The effort to sell a controlling stake in the unit could be further complicated by the attempt by more than a dozen creditors to temporarily block the sale of the energy-trading business. Those creditors, which include Royal Bank of Scotland and power-trading rivals, have asked for guarantees that Enron will put the proceeds in an escrow account until a determination has been made about how it will be split among creditors.   Until recently, Enron's energy-trading unit, which includes its EnronOnline Internet-based trading platform, traded dozens of products and generated roughly 90% of the firm's earnings in the most recent quarter. Trading all but dried up in the wake of the company's Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing.    .....................................................................................................................................     Newscast: Enron's energy trading operations up for auction    01/11/2002  Minnesota Public Radio: Marketplace Morning Report   (c) Copyright 2002, Minnesota Public Radio. All Rights Reserved.     KAI RYSSDAL, anchor: Good morning. I'm Kai Ryssdal in Los Angeles.   Alongside all the hullabaloo yesterday in Washington over who knew what when about Enron's collapse, the company's energy trading operations are up for auction. MARKETPLACE's Judy Martin looks at what's at stake in the outcome.  JUDY MARTIN reporting:   Enron went on the auction block with its trading operations for good reason. Fitch credit analyst Ralph Pelleichia says this may be the only way for the company to re-enter the trading business following bankruptcy.   Mr. RALPH PELLEICHIA (Fitch Credit Analyst): Prior to bankruptcy, the wholesale trading business generated approximately 75 percent of the earnings in cash flow. So this is--is and would be a major contributor for the company and an opportunity for the company to prevent liquidation.   MARTIN: At least two heavy-hitters, Citicorp and UBS Warburg, reportedly submitted bids for the company's most successful electricity and gas trading operations. But Pelleichia says the stigma of Enron's reputation for earnings overstatement lingers.   Mr. PELLEICHIA: Whoever they deal with would have to be financially strong with great credibility.   MARTIN: Regardless of the challenges, Enron made a lot of money in energy marketing and trading, and it's that business those bidders are vying for. In New York, I'm Judy Martin for MARKETPLACE.    .....................................................................................................................................

I hope that the procedure will come to a closure soon so that you can come to bring her home with you!     I was, indeed, able to travel back to Kazakhstan last month without any significant problems.  I was on the first BA flight Houston-London after the attacks, so the lines were huge, but there was no problem with the flights themselves or with security.  It just took more airport time.     In Kazakhstan, the situation is currently peaceful.  The government here seems concerned with protecting its borders and American interests.  We are in contact with the American embassy here, and have made contingency plans in case the situation deteriorates, but we feel fine about remaining here at this time.     Please let me know if you have any specific questions.   Sincerely,   Catherine  ",

		"_body" : " Top Of The News  The Enron Chain Saw Massacre  Dan Ackman, Forbes.com, 01.11.02, 8:16 AM ET   The Enron scandal is becoming more and more like a horror movie: It's not what's on screen that scares you, it's the unseen monster in the dark.   Yesterday, Enron's accountants and the presidential Cabinet officers added to the scare and sent the burgeoning scandal in new directions.   Arthur Andersen, the esteemed accounting firm, admitted it had destroyed Enron documents. That's bad, but what Arthur Andersen says it doesn't know may be worse. It says the records included \"a significant but undetermined number of electronic and paper documents and correspondence.\"   The firm goes on to say, \"After receiving [an] SEC subpoena, the firm issued an instruction to preserve documents.\" What, one wonders, was Andersen's \"instruction\" before it received the subpoena--to destroy Enron documents with abandon? Did the accountants comply with the directive to preserve the documents? Andersen doesn't know: \"At this time, we have not been able to determine whether that instruction was violated,\" the firm says in a statement.   Andersen says it has \"also asked former U.S. Sen. John Danforth to conduct an immediate and comprehensive review of Andersen's records management policy and to recommend improvements.\" It does not say how much it is paying Danforth for his counsel, but it can have this policy tip for nothing: Don't destroy documents related to a scandal that led to a bankruptcy that wiped out $70 billion in shareholder value.   These unanswered questions are part of a pattern with Enron. No one really knows how it got so rich, or what it was doing with the many private partnerships managed by its executives. No one knows what prompted former Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling to quit the company in August 2001. Indeed, at a bankruptcy court hearing earlier this week, it was revealed that Enron does not know the location of 79 of its top executives or even if they still work for the company.   Separately, the White House revealed that Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman, called Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans to warn them of the company's looming bankruptcy. This disclosure came with an additional announcement that Attorney General John Ashcroft has recused himself from the criminal investigation of Enron because of contributions he's received from company executives.   Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, said Lay telephoned O'Neill amid Enron's collapse \"to advise him about his concern about the obligations of Enron and whether they would be able to meet those obligations.'' Lay added that Enron \"was heading to bankruptcy,'' Fleischer said.   O'Neill received calls from Lay on Oct. 28 and Nov. 8, said Treasury Spokeswoman Michele Davis. By then, Enron made its stunning disclosure of a $638 million third-quarter loss. Still, as of Oct. 28, Enron was still trading at over $15 per share.   In a separate phone call to Don Evans, Lay similarly worried about the default on its bank and bond debt. He \"was having problems with his bond rating and he was worried about its impact on the energy sector,'' Fleischer said.   Fleischer did not say what Evans or O'Neill told Lay, but they spoke to each other \"and they both agreed no action should be taken to intervene with their bond holders,'' and indeed no action was taken. The spokesman had said earlier he did not know of anyone in the White House who discussed Enron's financial situation. Did he even ask--or was not knowing the better option?   Ashcroft stepped aside from the criminal investigation of Enron because he received campaign contributions from Enron executives during his campaign for the U.S. Senate in 2000. In addition to contributing to Ashcroft's senatorial campaign, Lay also gave $25,000 to a leadership committee headed by then-senator Ashcroft, according to the Center for Public Integrity. Enron, Lay and other executives have also been major contributors to President George Bush, both during his 2000 presidential campaign and during his runs for the Texas statehouse. Prior to Lay's contacts with O'Neill and Evans, Enron officials had extensive contact with Vice President Dick Cheney and his aides, when they worked together on a response to a much ballyhooed but quickly deflated energy crisis <http://forbes.com/2001/05/02/0502nocrisis.html> in the spring of 2001.   Trying to insulate himself from the scandal, President Bush has ordered a review headed by O'Neill of U.S. pension and corporate disclosure rules. That review is intended, the administration says, to avoid a repeat of the energy-trading firm's collapse, in which thousands of employees lost most or all of their life savings. But Fleischer dismissed suggestions that the Justice Department investigation announced earlier this week should give way to a probe by an independent counsel.   The president, for his part, saw Lay at a Houston charity event last spring at the White House with other business leaders last year. But he said he never discussed Enron's finances. \"I have never discussed with Mr. Lay the financial problems of the company,\"   Bush said yesterday. \"I have not met with him personally.\" That's good: The last thing you want to do in a horror movie is meet with the villain alone.    USA: NYSE says Enron trading halt to continue.  01/11/2002 Reuters English News Service  (C) Reuters Limited 2002.   NEW YORK, Jan 11 (Reuters) - The New York Stock Exchange on Friday said the trading halt on shares of collapsed energy giant Enron Corp. would continue pending information on the terms of the proposed transaction with Swiss bank UBS AG.  The stock exchange said it continues to review Enron's listing status in light of recent events. On Friday, Enron said UBS agreed to take control of its key energy trading unit after an auction left rival bidder Citigroup Inc. empty handed.  Trading in shares of Enron were suspended on the New York Stock Exchange all day Friday. The stock closed Thursday at 67 cents, a fraction of its former value of $90 a share 18 months ago.  .....................................................................................................................................

USA: UPDATE 1-Enron spread the wealth around Washington. By Susan Cornwell  01/11/2002 Reuters English News Service  (C) Reuters Limited 2002.   WASHINGTON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Former energy-trading giant Enron Corp. not only lavished campaign donations on President George W. Bush, but was one of America's biggest political contributors, spreading money across both parties on Capitol Hill.  Nearly half the current U.S. House of Representatives and almost three-quarters of the current Senate have been beneficiaries of Enron largesse in recent years, say the Washington watchdog groups that monitor campaign cash. Since 1989, Enron has made a whopping $5.8 million in campaign donations, 73 percent to Republicans and 27 percent to Democrats, says the Center for Responsive Politics, an organization that tracks political giving.  Nearly half of these funds were donated during 1999-2000, when Enron was one of the top 50 organizational donors in the United States, the Center says.  The money kept coming in until just before Enron filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 2. Since then, as the controversy around Enron has grown, some donations have been given back.  Texans were by far the biggest Enron recipients, and Republicans got more than Democrats. Bush, being both a Texan and a Republican, and a friend of Enron chairman Kenneth Lay to boot, did very well.  Enron was Bush's biggest political patron as he headed into the 2000 presidential election. In all it has made $623,000 in contributions to his campaigns since 1993, when he was raising money for his first Texas gubernatorial race, according to the Center for Public Integrity, another follow-the-money group.  'MONEY FOR ACCESS'  But the giving did not stop after election day. Enron officials contributed $10,500 to his Florida recount committee, and when the recount was ended, they donated $300,000 for the inaugural celebrations, said Holley Bailey, researcher for the Center for Responsive Politics.  \"I think what is interesting about their giving over the last year, is that they used any method possible to support President Bush's campaign run,\" she said.  What Enron got in exchange for the money was access, Bailey asserted. She noted that Lay had met Vice President Dick Cheney during last year's California energy crisis, at the same time the administration was formulating its energy policy.  \"One thing is clear. They have written checks to a lot of people in this town and I guess that gets their phone calls answered when they call Cabinet secretaries,\" Bailey said.  It was disclosed this week that Lay telephoned two Cabinet officials last fall as the company's financial situation worsened. Enron on Dec. 2 made the largest bankruptcy court filing in U.S. history.  The Justice Department has opened a criminal probe into Enron's collapse, which wiped out the pensions of thousands, and several congressional committees are also investigating.  MIDAS TOUCH  The White House points out, accurately, that Enron also contributed money to lawmakers, Democrats among them. Indeed, on Capitol Hill, few have escaped Enron's Midas touch.  Texas Senators Kay Bailey Hutchison and Phil Gramm, both Republicans, top the list, having received $99,500 and $97,350 respectively in campaign contributions from Enron, the Center for Responsive Politics says.  But senior Democrats and those on committees relevant to Enron's energy-trading business got donations too. For example, Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, a Democrat, received $21,933, the Center said. He is on the energy committee.  Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota received $6,000 in Enron contributions. Democratic Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, who chairs the governmental affairs committee that will probe Enron's fall, got a $2,000 donation.  In the House, the top beneficiary of Enron generosity, Democrat Ken Bentsen of Texas, has received $42,750 in contributions since he was elected in 1994.  But Bentsen is giving back $2,000 of Enron money he has received since the last election - not to Enron, though. He is looking for a fund that will help its laid-off employees.  He's not the only one shunning Enron money now. The National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee as well as the Republican Governors Association recently returned Enron donations totaling $160,000.  And the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is giving to charity a $100,000 Enron donation that it received in late November, just days before Enron filed for bankruptcy.  Asked why he topped the House list of Enron recipients, Bentsen explained that his district is in the greater Houston area, where Enron is based, and that he has had to raise a lot of money over his career fighting well-financed challengers.  \"The bottom line is somedays I've enjoyed support from Enron and other days I haven't,\" Bentsen added. He recalls Lay supported his opponent, Dolly Madison McKenna, in 1996.  \"He (Lay) said, 'I think she's going to be better than you.' It really made me mad,\" Bentsen said.  .....................................................................................................................................   Senator Says Panel to Subpoena Enron And Arthur Andersen, Among Others By Jocelyn Parker  01/11/2002 Dow Jones Business News  (Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)   Dow Jones Newswires  DETROIT -- U.S. Sen. Carl Levin said Friday a congressional panel will issue 51 subpoenas to embattled energy-trading giant Enron Corp., its auditor Arthur Anderson, and others following Anderson's disclosure it destroyed documents related to its work for Enron. At a press briefing in Detroit, Mr. Levin (D., Mich.), said the Anderson subpoena will require that the firm submit all information, including e-mails and other documents. The return date on the subpoena is Jan. 31.  \"It is troubling that when there's an investigation going on that they (Arthur Anderson) would destroy the documents of their clients,\" Mr. Levin told reporters.  Mr. Levin said he learned about the destruction of documents Thursday. Enron (ENE) hasn't responded to the subpoenas.  Enron, Houston, went from a being a darling of Wall Street to making the largest bankruptcy filing in the nation's history in December. The Justice Department is investigating the company because of questions about the company's accounting practices and possible criminal wrongdoing.  \"The criminal investigation by the Department of Justice is not surprising in light of what is known so far,\" Mr. Levin said in a statement.  Mr. Levin also said at the briefing that it's likely that the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations will learn about other things that will \"no doubt lead to other subpoenas.\"  -- By Jocelyn Parker, Dow Jones Newswires; 313-963-7810  Copyright (c) 2002 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.  All Rights Reserved  .....................................................................................................................................   Federal Judge Declines To Transfer Enron Case To Houston By Kathy Chu  01/11/2002 Dow Jones News Service  (Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES   NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- A federal bankruptcy judge declined to transfer beleaguered Enron Corp.'s (ENE) bankruptcy case to Houston - as some creditors have requested - giving the company its second taste of victory Friday. The move, by Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez, of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, was widely expected by many bankruptcy experts and is an attempt to maintain stability for a case that's almost six weeks old.  Earlier Friday, Enron said that Swiss bank UBS AG has agreed to buy part of the bankrupt company's energy-trading operations. This deal is considered vital to reviving a stagnant business that generated 90% of the company's $101 billion in revenue last year.   In his 42-page ruling issued late Friday, Judge Gonzalez said New York is the \"most efficient forum\" for administering Enron's bankruptcy case.  \"New York is a world financial center, and as such, has the resources that will be required to address the debtors' financial issues,\" he said.  Also, because the parties \"most essential\" to reorganization are here, it makes sense for the court to retain jurisdiction, according to Gonzalez.  The company's debtor-in-possession lenders, its financial advisers and the majority of its lawyers are based in Manhattan. Also, 11 of the company's 20 largest unsecured claims - belonging to a handful of financial institutions - emanate from New York.   The judge said that, while he is \"sympathetic\" to the concerns of Enron's former employees - who have said it would be a burden for them to attend hearings outside of Texas - many of the issues concerning these workers will be addressed by congressional and federal investigations.  Employees lost billions of dollars in savings when Enron's energy-trading operations collapsed after the company's debt was downgraded to junk. In the weeks leading up to the rating agencies' decisions, Enron restated more than three years of earnings and wrote down $1.2 billion in shareholder equity.  The company's 401(k) plan holders, along with creditors such as former merger partner Dynegy Inc. (DYN), El Paso Merchant Energy LP and Dunhill Resources have all sought the case's transfer to Texas.  When informed late Friday by Dow Jones Newswires of the judge's decision to keep the case in New York, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said, \"... Obviously, we are supportive of the decision.\"  .....................................................................................................................................   Ashcroft spoke to business group after Enron's Lay made request, Justice Department says By KAREN GULLO Associated Press Writer  01/11/2002 Associated Press Newswires  Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.   WASHINGTON (AP) - Shortly after he was confirmed as attorney general, John Ashcroft was invited by Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay to speak at an exclusive meeting of corporate leaders, Justice Department officials said Friday.  Lay, who was vice chairman of the Business Council, introduced Ashcroft at the Feb. 22, 2001, meeting in Washington. Ashcroft spoke about the importance of lowering crime. Government officials, including Federal Reserve members as well as Cabinet secretaries from all recent administrations, have spoken at other meetings of the Business Council, whose members are executives of the nation's largest companies.  Ashcroft's speech was arranged by his schedulers and the attorney general never spoke directly to Lay, said department officials.  The information was released in response to an inquiry by The Associated Press about Ashcroft's dealings with Enron since he became attorney general.  Lay and Enron executives donated over $50,000 to Ashcroft's fund-raising committees in his unsuccessful campaign for Senate re-election in 2000.  Ashcroft has recused himself from a Justice Department criminal investigation of the failed energy company.  Lay's contacts with members of the Bush administration were the focus of intense scrutiny after officials disclosed that Lay and Enron's president had contacted two Cabinet members and a top Treasury official for help when the company was in a financial tailspin.  .....................................................................................................................................

All Rights Reserved.   WASHINGTON (AP) - Enron sought the Bush administration's intervention with banks in an effort late last year to stop the company's spiral into bankruptcy, the U.S. Treasury Department disclosed Friday as the White House worked to control political fallout from a widening investigation.  \"This dog won't hunt. That's a reference to the politics of it,\" said presidential spokesman Ari Fleischer amid the latest information on the collapse of the Houston-based energy conglomerate. Enron President Lawrence \"Greg\" Whalley telephoned Treasury's undersecretary for domestic finance, Peter Fisher, \"six to eight times\" in late October and early November, said department spokeswoman Michele Davis.  It was the first indication that the energy trading firm, which has ties to many top Bush administration officials, had asked for government intervention as it faced collapse. Once the seventh largest U.S. company, Enron delcared bankruptcy Dec. 2.  \"As Enron's negotiations with its bankers for an extension of credit neared a decision point, the president of Enron asked Undersecretary Fisher to call the banks,\" Davis said.  Fisher \"inferred he was being asked to encourage the banks to extend credit. He made no such calls,\" she said.  The announcement followed disclosures that Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay, one of President George W. Bush's biggest political contributors, had called Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, Commerce Secretary Don Evans and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan in the days leading up to the biggest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history last fall.  Administration officials have denied that any government aid was ever extended to the beleaguered company.  Democrats, seeing the disclosures as an opportunity to chip away at Bush's high approval ratings, are emphasizing the close ties between Enron and administration officials and the impact of the failure on Enron employees.  Thousands of workers were laid off and many saw their retirement nest eggs vanish when Enron stock plunged in advance of the bankruptcy filing.  White House officials worked Friday to try to limit the damage, and to put distance between the president and the Enron chief.  \"This needs to be fully investigated to determine if there was any criminal wrongdoing by Enron,\" said Bush press secretary Fleischer. He said the president also is pressing for a review of rules governing 401(k) retirement plans like those at Enron.  \"If anybody else wants to focus on politics, that's their prerogative. But the president's focus is on getting to the bottom of this fully,\" Fleischer said aboard Air Force One on a presidential trip to Pennsylvania.  Meanwhile, senior Bush adviser Karl Rove offered his view of the relationship between Bush and Lay. \"The president knows him. He is a friend. But the idea that he is a friend in the sense that this is a guy who's a close intimate is just ludicrous,\" Rove said in an interview with The Associated Press.  When Bush was the governor of Texas, Lay was chairman of the governor's business council. \"They had quarterly meetings and he'd come in and talk to the then-governor about what it was they hoped to achieve at the meeting and they'd go over the agenda,\" Rove said.  Bush has described Lay as \"a supporter.\" He said he saw Lay twice last year, but that they did not discuss Enron's finances.  .....................................................................................................................................

Congress Demands Documents From Enron, Andersen (Update2) 2002-01-11 18:10 (New York)  Congress Demands Documents From Enron, Andersen (Update2)       (Adds Fisher's lack of holdings in 12th paragraphs.)       Washington, Jan. 11 (Bloomberg) -- Congress demanded documents and personal files from executives at Enron Corp., auditor Arthur Andersen LLP and 49 current and former officers and directors in an effort to find out what led to the biggest U.S. bankruptcy.      The House Energy and Commerce Committee asked for the personal files of David Duncan and five other Andersen partners involved in the audit of Enron, after Andersen said its employees had destroyed documents and e-mails, committee spokesman Ken Johnson said. The Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations subpoenaed papers from both Enron, once the biggest energy trader, and Andersen.       Congress acted a day after President George W. Bush's administration said Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay, a long-time political backer of the president, had unsuccessfully sought government help for Enron from Commerce Secretary Don Evans and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill. Today Treasury disclosed that Enron President Greg Whalley called Undersecretary Peter Fisher at least six times in October and early November to ask him to contact bankers on behalf of the company.      ``This debacle is so massive, it requires speed and thoroughness,'' said Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the Subcommittee on Investigations. ``The subpoenas are necessary in order to get prompt and thorough review of the documents in question.''      Levin said the subpoenas were changed at the last minute yesterday to request information on Andersen's destruction of documents, a development he said was ``very troubling.'' Responses to the subpoenas are due Jan. 31, Levin said.                           $26 Billion Loss       Enron said Nov. 8 that it had inflated earnings by $586 million over four years. The company filed for bankruptcy protection Dec. 2 after a seven-week stock slide that erased $26 billion in value. Employees who were unable to sell Enron stock in their retirement plans say they lost about $850 million.      At least six congressional committees are investigating Enron's collapse. Committee leaders say they need to understand exactly what happened at Enron to determine whether new laws and regulations are needed to improve disclosure, change accounting practices or protect employee retirement accounts.                          Contacts Disclosed       After declining to comment in detail on Enron's bankruptcy for several weeks, yesterday the administration said Lay called Evans on Oct. 29 and asked him to intervene with Moody's Investors Service to prevent a downgrade of Enron's debt, Commerce spokesman Jim Dyke said.      ``Evans decided that taking any action would be inappropriate,'' Dyke said. ``There was no information exchanged between Mr. Lay and Secretary Evans that was not part of the public domain.''      Lay also spoke with O'Neill about how a collapse of Enron might hurt financial markets, Treasury spokeswoman Michelle Davis said yesterday. O'Neill also decided to take no action.      When Whalley called Fisher, ``Undersecretary Fisher inferred he was being asked to encourage banks to extend credit,'' Davis said. ``He made no such calls.''      Treasury said that while a trust in his parents name included Enron shares, Fisher ``does not now and never has held common stock in Enron.''      Evans and O'Neill didn't tell Bush about the calls until yesterday, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said. Bush said he hasn't spoken to Lay in more than six months.                        Campaign Contributions       Lay raised more than $100,000 for Bush's presidential campaign and let Bush aides use Enron's corporate jet on at least 30 occasions. Enron and its employees together were Bush's 12th- largest backer for the election, giving $113,800. Enron and its employees gave Democrat Al Gore $11,250.      Representative Henry Waxman of California, the senior Democrat on the House Government Reform Committee, today sent letters to O'Neill and Evans, requesting details on all contacts between Enron and officials at Treasury and Commerce. He also wants to know what the two departments told the White House.      ``The purpose of this request is to determine why the administration apparently did nothing to mitigate the harm of the Enron bankruptcy to thousands of its employees and shareholders,'' Waxman wrote.                           Senate Subpoenas       The documents sought by the Senate include working papers and notes from the auditors, memorandums from executives putting into place internal controls, and memos outlining and describing financing vehicles used for off-balance-sheet financing and other transactions.      Lay, who got $101 million from the sale of his Enron shares, according to plaintiff's attorneys representing shareholders, is among those receiving subpoenas from the Senate committee.      Jeffrey Skilling, the former chief executive officer who resigned on Aug. 14, is also subpoenaed, along with former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.      Members of the board of directors also were receiving subpoenas, including former Commodities Futures Trading Commission Chairwoman Wendy Gramm, the wife of Senator Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican, and a member of Enron's audit committee.                         Partnerships Targeted       The Senate subcommittee is targeting ``offshore entities, special-purpose entities and limited partnerships that Enron used,'' Levin said. It is asking whether the financing techniques Enron used should have raised flags for Enron's board and Andersen.      SEC Enforcement Director Stephen Cutler said yesterday the SEC will add Andersen's document destruction to the Enron-related matters it is investigating.      ``Destruction of documents is obviously an extremely serious matter,'' Cutler said.      Lawyers representing investors in lawsuits against Enron are watching the subcommittee because it is likely to obtain information sooner than will the civil courts.      Most of the shareholder lawsuits were filed in federal court in Houston and won't move to the discovery phase, in which lawyers may interrogate defendants and demand documents, for six months.      ``Skilling was clearly moving the company from an asset-based model to a pure trading machine,'' said Patrick Daniels, a lawyer at Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach. ``You would hope someone inside Enron was doing some analysis of how these deals would benefit Enron.''      Milberg Weiss represents the University of California, which lost $144 million in Enron's stock slide, and Deutsche Asset Management, which lost $61 million.  --William Roberts and Jeff Bliss in Washington, (202) 624-1909 or wroberts@bloomberg.net, with reporting by Laura Litvan, Simon Kennedy, Monee Fields-White and Julie Ziegler in Washington and Dan Hart in Detroit/mmw/*ps/mmw  Story illustration: To chart Enron's rise and fall over the last five years, see: {ENE US <Equity> GP W <GO>}  Treasury Spokesman Nichols Comments on Fisher's Enron Holdings 2002-01-11 18:02 (New York)        Washington, Jan. 11 (Bloomberg) -- Following are comments by U.S. Deputy Assistant Treasury Secretary Rob Nichols on Undersecretary of Treasury for Domestic Finance Peter Fisher's holdings in Enron Corp.       ``Peter Fisher does not now and never has held common stock in Enron Corp.

Enron Probe Overseen by Former Senate Counsel 2002-01-11 17:51 (New York)  Justice Dept. Enron Probe Overseen by Former Senate Counsel       Washington, Jan. 11 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Justice Department probe of Enron Corp. will be overseen by a lawyer with more than 20 years of prosecution experience, including running the U.S. Senate's investigation into the Whitewater scandal.      Michael Chertoff, the head of the department's criminal division, was Republican counsel to the special committee that investigated the involvement of former President Bill Clinton and his wife in the failed Whitewater real-estate development.      The Justice Department's investigation into the collapse of the world's largest energy trader will be led by Joshua Hochberg, the head of the department's fraud section since December 1998. Hochberg will be the acting U.S. attorney for the case.      ``Hochberg will be the day-to-day supervisor. Chertoff would be involved in big decisions -- decisions to indict or make a deal with low-level employees,'' said Gregory Wallance, a former federal prosecutor.      U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft won't be involved in the investigation, having announced yesterday his recusal from Enron matters. The Houston-based company was a major contributor to his 2000 Senate campaign.      Next in line is Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson, who is expected to have little involvement in the investigation, legal experts say.                              Task Force       The Justice Department is establishing an Enron task force, to be headed by Leslie Caldwell, the chief of the criminal division for the U.S. attorney's office in San Francisco. Caldwell, who has prosecuted organized crime and while collar crime, will report to Hochberg.      Enron announced Nov. 8 that it had inflated earnings by $585 million over four years. On Dec. 2, it filed the biggest U.S. bankruptcy after a seven-week stock slide that erased $26 billion in market value, wiped out 5,000 jobs and cost employees about $850 million in retirement savings.      During that period, employees were unable to sell Enron stock in their 401(k) plans. Top executives who had large holdings outside of the retirement plan were able to sell.      The investigation will likely concentrate on whether executives purposely misled investors about Enron's financial condition to prove criminal wrongdoing, experts say.      Deliberate misrepresentation of a company's financial condition transforms what is usually a civil violation of federal disclosure rules into a crime punishable by as much as 10 years in prison and a $1 million fine.                      `Best and Brightest'       The investigation will be based in Washington and include lawyers from the criminal division, including the fraud section, and from U.S. attorneys' offices throughout the country. Lawyers from the New York and San Francisco offices, which specialize in securities law and white collar crime, are expected to be involved, a Justice Department official said.      ``We're bringing in our best and brightest,'' said Justice Department spokesman Bryan Sierra. ``You go where they are known for this type of investigations.''      The decision to centralize the investigation makes sense because ``there's an enormous amount of legwork that goes into a case like this,'' said Wallance. ``It's inefficient to duplicate efforts.''      A grand jury is either already in the works or about to be impaneled, experts say. Investigators will be culling through documents, computer records, bank records and conducting scores of interviews, experts say.      ``They will be looking at what was being said, to whom it was being said and why it was being said,'' said Joe Whitley, a former acting associate attorney general.      Document destruction by Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's auditor, will also be examined to determine if the firm can be charged with obstruction of justice, Whitley said.                      Recusals, Recusals       Ashcroft's announcement that he wouldn't participate in the Enron probe followed a call to step aside by U.S. Representative Henry Waxman, a California Democrat, who cited about $55,000 that Enron and its Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay made to political groups aiding Ashcroft's unsuccessful re-election bid.      When Ashcroft recused himself from the investigation, he was unaware of the letter sent to his office by Waxman, a Justice Department official said.      The U.S. attorney's office in Houston also recused itself from the investigation because of the ``fact that a number of attorneys in the office, including the U.S. attorney, have family relationships with individuals who are arguably affected by the Enron bankruptcy,'' according to a statement released by U.S. Attorney Michael Shelby.      The Justice Department said it hasn't determined yet how it will conduct the investigation in Houston, though it may use Federal Bureau of Investigation facilities there.                             Men in Charge       In addition to the Enron probe, Chertoff is also running the investigation into the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.      A Harvard Law School graduate, Chertoff was U.S. attorney in New Jersey between 1990 and 1994. He was in charge of prosecuting ``Crazy Eddie'' Antar for securities fraud, New York's former chief judge, and the kidnappers and murderers of an Exxon Corp. executive. After leaving the U.S. attorney's office, Chertoff became a partner in the law firm of Latham & Watkins.      Hochberg prosecuted the brother of former New York Sen. Alfonse D'Amato for mail fraud, resulting in a conviction. A former deputy chief of public integrity at the department, Hochberg reviewed Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's Whitewater investigation and declined to call it off.      ``He's a career prosecutor,'' said Whitley. ``He's capable and able to cause people to collaborate. He will be an effective leader.''  --Anna Marie Stolley and William McQuillen in Washington, (202) 654-1249 or astolley@bloomberg.net, with reporting by James Rowley in Washington /ta  Enron Bankruptcy to Stay in New York; Move to Houston Denied 2002-01-11 17:42 (New York)  Enron Bankruptcy to Stay in New York; Move to Houston Denied       New York, Jan. 11 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s bankruptcy case, the largest in U.S. history, will stay in New York, a judge has ruled.      The decision is a defeat for Dynegy Inc. and other Enron creditors who had asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez to move the case to Houston. Enron and Dynegy, rival energy traders, are both based there.      Gonzalez also denied Dynegy's request to transfer a $10 billion lawsuit Enron brought against Dynegy for backing out of a merger that was supposed to rescue Enron.      Enron's Chapter 11 case and the lawsuit were filed Dec. 2 in Manhattan, where a small unit, Enron Metals and Commodity Corp., is based.      Dynegy argued in court papers that both cases should be shifted to Houston ``in the interest of justice and for the convenience of the parties.''      Enron, once a dominant force in the energy trading business, collapsed after announcing on Nov. 8 that it inflated earnings by $586 million over four years. The disclosure triggered a loss of confidence among investors and customers and the cancellation of a planned $23 billion merger with Dynegy.      The effort to move the case to Houston divided Enron's creditors. Some banks, including several based in New York and led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc., opposed a transfer. A committee appointed to represent Enron's unsecured creditors also favored keeping the case in New York.      Some Houston-based creditors of Enron, such as El Paso Group Inc., Reliant Energy Services Inc. and a group of Enron 401(k) plan holders, supported Dynegy's request for a change of venue.  --Jeff St.Onge and Christopher Mumma in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan (212) 233-2257, or jstonge@bloomberg.net and cmumma@bloomberg.net, through the New York newsroom (212) 893- 3665/ta/ep  Andersen's Berardino Gave Incorrect Enron Testimony to Congress 2002-01-11 17:36 (New York)  Andersen's Berardino Gave Incorrect Enron Testimony to Congress       Washington, Jan. 11 (Bloomberg) -- Arthur Andersen LLP Chief Executive Joseph Berardino gave inaccurate testimony to Congress last month about its audit of an Enron Corp. partnership because he didn't know the facts until this week, an Andersen spokesman said.      ``We're still trying to understand why he didn't know about it,'' Andersen spokesman David Tabolt said. ``There are millions of Enron documents we have to deal with, and we're doing the best we can.''      Berardino, who has headed the fifth largest accounting firm for a year, identified incorrectly who joined Enron in investing in an affiliated partnership of the company. That partnership, called Chewco Investments LP, was kept off Enron's books, enabling the energy trader to inflate earnings by $400 million starting in 1997.      Andersen's accounting of Enron is under investigation by the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and Congress. Andersen said yesterday that some of its employees destroyed a substantial number of documents related to its Enron audit.      Berardino learned of the correct information earlier this week when a news reporter called with an inquiry and Andersen looked up the answer, Tabolt said. The mistake was inconsequential because it would have had no effect on how Andersen handled its Enron audits or on the substance of Berardino's testimony, he said.      Berardino told the House Financial Services Committee on Dec. 12 that Andersen informed Enron's audit committee ``of possible illegal acts within the company'' involving Chewco. Andersen wasn't aware during the audits of the extent of Enron's financial commitment to Chewco, information that would have compelled the partnership to be included on Enron's books, Berardino testified.                           Small Companies       Enron's partner in the investment was ``a large financial institution,'' Berardino told Congress. This institution, which the Wall Street Journal identified as Barclays Plc, a British banking group, was to have its losses covered by Enron, Berardino said. Andersen wasn't aware of the extent of Enron's commitment, he said.      The Chewco investor wasn't ``a large financial institution'' but two limited-liability companies called Big River and Little River, Tabolt said. These two small companies borrowed about $11 million from the large bank, he said. A Barclay's spokesman declined to comment.      Andersen discovered Berardino's error this week while researching the answer to a Wall Street Journal reporter's question, Tabolt said.                         `No Material Effect'       ``The mistake had no material effect on Mr. Berardino's testimony,'' Tabolt said. ``We're still trying to understand why we weren't made aware of the information at the time of the audits.''      Spokesmen for House Financial Services Committee Chairman Mike Oxley and Representative Richard Baker, chairman of the panel's subcommittee on capital markets, didn't respond to requests for comment.  --Neil Roland in Washington (202) 624-1868 or nroland@bloomberg.net  /ba Enron CEO Resigns From Compaq's Board of Directors (Update5) 2002-01-11 17:39 (New York)  Enron CEO Resigns From Compaq's Board of Directors (Update5)       (Adds more comment from Lorsch in the eighth paragraph.)       Houston, Jan. 11 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay resigned from the board of Compaq Computer Corp., as Congress increases scrutiny of Enron's bankruptcy, the largest in U.S. history.      Lay, 59, stepped down ``to focus on his other responsibilities,'' said Sarah Thobae, a spokeswoman for Houston- based Compaq, the second largest-personal computer maker. A director since 1987, Lay resigned effective Dec. 31, she said.      Enron, once the biggest energy trader, said Nov. 8 that it had inflated earnings by $586 million over four years. The company filed Dec. 2 for bankruptcy protection after a seven-week stock slide that erased $26 billion in value. Lay quit as a director of Eli Lilly and Co. on Dec. 11 and left the board of directors of I2 Technologies in October.      ``It could be that he knows something that's going to happen that will be embarrassing'' for the companies regarding the bankruptcy, said Jay Lorsch, a Harvard Business School professor who's written about corporate governance. ``He might want to avoid them that embarrassment.''      Lorsch said he doesn't think Lay was forced from the boards because so much time passed between the resignations.      Yesterday, President George W. Bush's administration said Lay unsuccessfully sought help for Enron from two Cabinet secretaries. Lay called Commerce Secretary Don Evans on Oct. 29 and also spoke with Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill. Neither took action on behalf of Houston-based Enron, the administration said.                         President's Task Force       Bush yesterday appointed a task force to investigate Enron's collapse and at least six congressional committees are investigating. Congress today demanded documents and personal files from executives of Enron and its auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP.      ``If there are some kind of legal actions being taken against him, he might want to free himself of the connections'' to other boards, Lorsch said.      The shares of Compaq rose 50 cents, or 4.6 percent, to $11.50 in regular U.S. trading and have fallen 40 percent in the past year.      Lay in October sold 124,596 Compaq shares valued at $1.15 million, according to a regulatory filing. He still owned 340,724 shares at the month's end.      Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said Lay remains on the board of TCW Group Inc., a money-management firm with more than $75 billion in assets under management.      Compaq now has seven members on its board and has no immediate plans to name a new member, Thobae said.      Compaq agreed to be acquired by rival Hewlett-Packard Co. on Sept. 3 after a unanimous vote by the board. If the deal is completed, its proposed acquisition of Compaq, five Compaq directors will join Hewlett-Packard's board.  --Peter J.

Officials Order Blackouts   By PAUL CHAVEZ, Associated Press Writer   LOS ANGELES (AP) - State power managers ordered rolling blackouts across   California for a second straight day Tuesday as demand for electricity again   exceeded supply.   The same factors that collided to strap California's power supply on Monday   hit again, officials with the Independent System Operator said. Those include   reduced electricity imports from the Pacific Northwest, numerous power plants   offline for repairs and higher-than-expected demand because of warm   temperatures.   A two-unit Southern California plant that the ISO hoped would be working   Tuesday had not been fixed. One of its units might go online at noon to help   the situation, the ISO's Jim Detmers said.   In addition, hydroelectric power imports from the Northwest were 800   megawatts lower than Monday, he said. The ISO oversees most of the state's   power grid.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  California Panel to Order Utilities to Make $1 Billion in Back Payments  By Jason Leopold    03/20/2001  Dow Jones Business News  (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)    Dow Jones Newswires   LOS ANGELES -- The California Public Utilities Commission will order Edison   International's Southern California Edison and PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas &   Electric unit to pay small power generators that are qualified utilities   about $1 billion in past-due payments in order to keep the plant owners from   dragging the utilities into an involuntary bankruptcy proceedings, and to   also ensure the generation units keep pumping out electricity, people   familiar with the matter told Dow Jones Newswires late Monday.  Gov. Gray Davis, state Sen. Debra Bowen, and Assemblymembers Fred Keeley and   Robert Hertzberg, all Democrats, spent most of the day y trying to hammer out   an agreement with the so-called qualifying facilities, alternative power   producers that use the wind, sun, steam and biomass to generate electricity   for the state, on supply contracts and past payments the utilities failed to   make.   The qualifying facilities, which represent about one-third of the state's   total power supply and signed contracts to sell power directly to the   utilities under a government mandate, would then agree to sign power-supply   contracts with the utilities for a period of five to 10 years for about $79 a   megawatt hour for the first five years and about $61 a megawatt hour   thereafter, two sources involved in the negotiations said.   The PUC is expected to issue a draft resolution on the issue sometime this   week, one source said.   The lawmakers wouldn't comment on the details of their talks Monday.   Representatives with SoCal Ed (EIX) and PG&E (PCG) said they were unaware   Gov. Davis and his administration were meeting on the issue.   The utilities are more than $13 billion in debt and have failed to make   payments on their qualifying-facilities contracts since November. PG&E has   paid some of its qualified facilities just a fraction of what they are owed.     Legislation To Restructure QF Rates Stalls In Senate Energy Committee     Mr. Keeley had recently drafted legislation, along with state Sen. Jim   Battin, a Republican from Palm Desert, that would have restructured the rates   the qualified facilities charge the utilities, from $170 a megawatt hour to   $80 a megawatt hour for five years.   The bill, SB47X, stalled in the Senate Energy Committee, of which Ms. Bowen   chairs. SoCal Ed opposed the legislation, saying the rates were still too   high. A utility spokesman said the qualified-facilities rates should be   reduced to under $50 a megawatt hour.   But the lawmakers and the governor is trying to avoid the need for   legislation, largely because there isn't much support in both houses for such   a bill and the chance that it won't be passed in time to keep the qualified   facilities from dragging the utilities into involuntary bankruptcy   proceedings, the legislative source said.   The PUC will take over the issue from the Legislature, the source said.   Monday, about 3,000 megawatts of qualified-facilities generation went offline   because the companies that operate the power plants can no longer afford to   buy natural gas used to fuel the plants due to the utilities' failure to pay   money owed to the companies, said Jim Detmers, vice president of operations   for the state's Independent System Operator.   The outages triggered a major shortfall in the state which resulted in nearly   eight hours of statewide rolling blackouts Monday.   Many owners of the qualified-facilities said without immediate relief, they   would likely force SoCal Ed, and possibly PG&E, into involuntary bankruptcy,   perhaps as soon as Thursday.   One such facility, CalEnergyOperating Co., wants to be freed temporarily from   its contract with the utility and be allowed to sell its electricity to third   parties until the utility is able to pay its bills. CalEnergy is an affiliate   of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co., which is majority owned by Warren   Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRKA).   The company sued SoCal Ed last month, and the case is scheduled to be heard   Thursday in Imperial County Superior Court. If a judge delivers an   unfavorable ruling, CalEnergy and other unsecured creditors would drag SoCal   Ed into involuntary bankruptcy, three executives with the companies involved   said.   CalEnergy is said to be organizing a bankruptcy petition now circulating   among six of Southern California Edison's independent power suppliers and   could file the petition very quickly if it fails in its suit Thursday, said   executives with three of the six companies.

All Rights Reserved  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  --------------------------------------------------------------------------  As Davis Seeks Money, Lawmakers Want Answers   Members of both parties angry at lack of dialogue   Lynda Gledhill, Greg Lucas, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau  Tuesday, March 20, 2001   ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle   Sacramento -- The Legislature has warned it may block further state purchases   of electricity as lawmakers' frustration with Gov. Gray Davis' handling of   the energy crisis increases.   A test may come soon because Davis asked yesterday for another $500 million   to continue buying power.   Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, chairman of the Joint Legislative Budget   Committee, wrote to Davis' Finance Department on Friday that the committee   might deny further spending requests \"in the absence any discernable   progress\" from the Public Utilities Commission to ensure that the state would   get its money back.   Members of the committee, both Republican and Democratic, said they supported   Peace's call for more oversight of the spending, given the lack of   information from Davis on details of the state's power purchases.   \"He's been holding things close to the chest, and that bothers me,\" said Sen.   John Vasconcellos, D-Santa Clara. \"I want to know a lot more.\"   Sen. Dick Ackerman, R-Fullerton, said the administration \"has been   stonewalling us about how much is being spent, and how much power we're   getting for it. When the state is spending that kind of money, at a minimum,   legislators should know for what.\"   The state had spent $2.6 billion on electricity through March 11. Davis'   request for more money would put the state at the $3 billion mark by the   middle of April. The state is spending an average of $49 million a day.   The money is supposed to be paid back through the rates collected from   utilities' customers. It is up to the PUC to decide how to divide that money   among the state, the utilities and the utilities' debtors. The commission is   scheduled to take up the issue at its March 27 meeting.   The problem is that there appear to be more demands on the money than there   is money to go around.   The utilities have said they need the money to pay off some of their   creditors. Among those looking for cash are alternative-power generators that   were selling electricity to Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern   California Edison. Half of them have shut down because they have not been   paid.   Earlier this month, the PUC granted the Department of Water Resources, which   has been purchasing electricity for the state, the power to recoup its full   costs through rates.   It's unclear whether that can be accomplished without raising electricity   prices, though Davis has insisted he can solve the crisis without boosting   rates.   Lawmakers said they approved the bill that allowed the state to buy power in   the belief such purchases would be a stopgap until the Davis administration   could sign long-term contracts with power suppliers. However, only about 19   contracts have been signed to date, out of 42 agreements. If all the   contracts are signed, they will account for about 70 percent of the power   California is expected to need.   \"It was our expectation some of these contracts would kick in,\" said   Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco. \"This was designed to only be   bridge money to avert a power disaster. We should hold firm and come up with   a plan.   \"I recall about three weeks ago when we first asked about one of these $500   million letters,\" Migden said. \"We said maybe this one is necessary, but   there won't be carte blanche approval of any future requests. I'm pleased   Sen. Peace is taking that approach.\"   To Assemblyman George Runner, R-Lancaster, Peace's letter was \"another way   for the Legislature to send a message we need to be in this loop. We're just   getting a small little dribble of information, which just creates more   questions.\"   A spokesman for the Department of Finance said officials hoped to work with   the committee members about their concerns.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  --------------------------------------------------------------  Jones rips state on energy crisis   Secretary of state hints that he'll take on Davis in 2002.   By John Ellis   The Fresno Bee  (Published March 20, 2001)   Officially, he's Bill Jones, secretary of state for California. Unofficially,   he's Bill Jones, 2002 gubernatorial candidate.   The evidence is right there between the lines -- in the subtleties of his   speeches, their subject matter, and the way Jones carries himself when he's   in public.   Monday was no different, as Jones addressed a Rotary Club luncheon in Fresno   full of people who are assuming -- though nothing is official -- that the   Fresno native will soon announce his intention to challenge Gov. Davis next   year.   \"Bill, they call me governor,\" Chas Looney, a former Rotary Club district   governor, quipped to Jones. \"I look forward to the day we all can call you   governor.\"   Jones then proceeded to deliver a speech to a packed house in the DoubleTree   Hotel that touched on his accomplishments as secretary of state, but quickly   moved to his main topic: California's crumbling infrastructure and how the   energy crisis is affecting the state.   Always in the background but never mentioned by name was Davis. Jones was   careful to hew to the Rotary rule that speeches steer clear of partisan   politics.   Still, Jones looked, sounded and acted like a candidate for governor, and   near the end of his speech he promised his decision would come soon.   The Fresno Republican's speech began by highlighting his work in passing the   \"Three Strikes and You're Out\" initiative in 1994.   Jones also talked of his efforts to remove 2 million inactive California   voters from the rolls.   But it was clearly the energy crisis and its ramifications -- an issue   Republicans feel they can pin on Davis and the Democratic-controlled   Legislature -- that was the centerpiece of the speech.   Today, the energy crisis is being driven, he said, by a lack of power plant   construction. And while billions go to solve the crisis, he said, the state   faces $100 billion in unmet infrastructure needs -- everything from school   repair to road repair.   \"Doesn't that scare you?\" Jones asked.   He then recounted the warning signs -- ignored by the state, he said -- of   the looming energy crisis.   He cited the initial warnings that the deregulation bill was flawed, last   summer's request by Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric to allow forward   contracting and the Republican request for a special session to deal with the   energy crisis. All ignored, Jones said.   Now, Edison and PG&E are near bankruptcy and the state finds itself stepping   up as a creditor. \"And the solution now becomes California getting into the   energy business,\" he said. \"Or, even carrying it to a greater degree, not   just in the short term to buy power to keep the lights on. I'm talking about   basically socializing the energy business.\"   Jones said he prefers low-interest loans to Edison and PG&E, taking the   electric grid as collateral.   \"I just do not believe in California getting into something it does not know   how to do -- has never done before -- on top of all of our other   obligations,\" he said.   \"It really worries me that California will not be able to endure that type of   obligation.\"   Jones said polls now show increasing numbers of residents saying the state is   headed in the wrong direction.   \"I feel obligated to speak out and say there is a better way,\" Jones said.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  --------------------------------------------------------------------------  Day 2 -- Battling blackouts: Payment plan sought to restart small plants  By Dale Kasler and Carrie Peyton  Bee Staff Writers  (Published March 21, 2001)   Blackouts rolled across California for a second straight day Tuesday,   snarling traffic, darkening businesses and sending state officials scrambling   to craft a payment plan to revive the wind farms and other critically needed   small energy producers that have shut down because of financial woes.   On a day when another 570,000 customers lost power, Gov. Gray Davis said the   Public Utilities Commission and the Legislature would move promptly to order   Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison to start paying   those small energy producers for their electricity. Davis said the two   utilities will face \"considerable fines\" if they don't pay up.   But several of the producers, known as \"qualifying facilities,\" said they   doubted Davis' plan would go far enough to get them back in operation. And it   wasn't clear whether the plan would keep the increasingly impatient   alternative producers from hauling one or both of the big utilities into   bankruptcy court, as some have threatened.   The shortage of power from the qualifying facilities -- plus a near-record   heat wave (downtown Sacramento topped off at 83 degrees, one degree short of   the 84 degree record set in 1960), a lack of hydropower and other problems --   prompted the state's Independent System Operator to order a second day of   blackouts starting mid-morning. But the blackouts hit only about half as many   Californians as Monday's, with late afternoon conservation efforts helping   balance supply with demand.   The blackouts, usually about an hour long, hit about 7,600 Sacramento   Municipal Utility District customers in Elk Grove and south Sacramento   County. PG&E customers in suburban counties were affected as well.   The order darkened shops in San Francisco's Chinatown and was blamed for a   crash that left two motorists seriously injured in the Los Angeles suburb of   South El Monte. A Sun Microsystems Inc. factory in Newark had to close for   several hours.   Most Californians took the blackouts in stride, though. Elk Grove High School   students filed outside to play hacky sack. Coffee shop patrons in Davis   milled outdoors, enjoying the unseasonably warm weather.   Yet the blackout order was met with outright defiance by one municipal   utility. The city of Lodi refused to cut power to its residents Monday or   Tuesday, saying it shouldn't have to suffer because of the financial crisis   afflicting PG&E and Edison.   The outlook for today and the near future was brighter, as several big power   plants came back on line after repairs. ISO officials also praised   Californians' conservation efforts, which had faltered in the morning but   came on strong in the afternoon, helping to prevent further blackouts. By   evening the grid was in a relatively mild Stage 2 power alert.   But the second day of blackouts -- plus an increasing threat of utility   bankruptcy -- pushed Davis to the brink. The governor cobbled together a   payment plan to rescue the qualifying facilities -- some 600 wind farms,   geothermal plants and other alternative-energy generators whose production   has become increasingly vital in recent days.   Under Davis' plan, the Legislature and the PUC would order PG&E and Edison to   pay the qualifying facilities for power delivered after April 1. The   utilities are required to buy power from the qualifying facilities under a   1978 federal law designed to bring cheaper and cleaner forms of electricity   to market.   Davis said the PUC would release a proposed order late Tuesday that would   require the utilities to pay the qualifying facilities $79 a megawatt hour   for five-year contracts or $69 for 10-year contracts. The Legislature also   would have to pass a law authorizing the PUC to issue such an order.   But the situation was far from resolved late Tuesday, and PG&E and Edison   were likely to oppose at least portions of Davis' plan.   Edison is willing only to make \"some kind of partial payments going forward,\"   said Thomas Higgins, a senior vice president with parent company Edison   International. \"We have a limited amount of resources available to us in   rates, ... and that's the constraining factor.\"   PG&E, which has been making partial payments to the qualifying facilities,   said it could pay them in advance, in full, for future power deliveries.   But PG&E said such payments would eat up half the $400 million it has   available each month to buy power -- and unless it gets a rate hike, there   wouldn't be enough to pay the qualifying facilities and cover other expenses,   including the cost of reimbursing the state Department of Water Resources for   the power the agency is buying on behalf of the troubled utility.   PG&E's proposal could represent a challenge of sorts to state officials:   Accept less money for the water department, or raise rates.   State officials \"need to resolve who they want to see paid,\" PG&E spokesman   John Nelson said. \"There is a limited pool of money.\"   For his part, Davis insisted that the water department would be first in line   to be paid, and he said the PUC will issue a proposed order to that effect.   \"We are getting paid before anybody else,\" Davis said.   Hundreds of qualifying facilities are out of commission because PG&E and   Edison haven't paid them. The situation has robbed the state of several   thousand badly needed megawatts and is a key reason blackouts have been   ordered. In normal times the facilities produce more than 20 percent of   California's electricity.   Some of the qualifying facilities have been threatening to haul one or both   of California's beleaguered utilities into bankruptcy court unless they get   paid soon, saying a bankruptcy filing might be the only way they can save   their businesses.   \"You've got to take care of the QF problem or the whole thing blacks out,\"   said Jerry Bloom, a lawyer representing one group of qualifying facilities.   \"(State officials) are starting to understand.\"   One thing that was fairly certain about Davis' still-sketchy payment plan: It   wouldn't cover PG&E and Edison's existing debt to the qualifying facilities,   estimated at more than $1.48 billion.   In their current financial state, the utilities say they can't afford to pay   the existing debt. In addition, paying the debt would create a major   complication: Other creditors, including the big power generators, would   surely haul Edison and PG&E into bankruptcy court on the grounds that they   weren't being treated fairly.   \"You can't give preferential payment treatment to one class of creditors over   another,\" PG&E's Nelson said. \"You virtually assure that (the other   creditors) have to file an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding against you.\"   But without full payment, it wasn't clear how many of the qualifying   facilities would be able to restart.   Executives at several plants -- the ones that run on natural gas -- said   they're not sure their gas suppliers will deliver unless the existing debts   are cleared up.   \"We need to convince a gas company to supply us,\" said Ed Tomeo of UAE Energy   Operations Corp., which had to shut off its 40-megawatt Kern County plant   Tuesday. \"We're a company that already owes millions of dollars for gas   supplies. How do you coax them to sell you millions more?\"   \"It's wishful thinking ... that the gas suppliers are going to sell us gas,\"   Robert Swanson of Ridgewood Power said.

The small city-run electric system is among many disgruntled utilities,   including the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, that believe their   contractual pledges to cut back during emergencies were never meant for times   like this.   \"It's been a philosophical debate up to this point. Now I guess we've drawn a   line in the sand,\" said Lodi utility director Alan Vallow.   PG&E said it is reviewing its interconnection contract, the agreement that   links Lodi to the grid through PG&E-owned high-voltage lines, to determine   what action it will take next.   \"It's unfortunate that while the city of Lodi has received the benefit of   this agreement for years, they are unwilling to bear the burden of this   statewide energy shortage,\" said PG&E's Jon Tremayne.   One utility coalition, the Northern California Power Agency, believes that   PG&E has already violated that agreement by not lining up enough power for   customers.   The agency wrote PG&E on Friday saying that its members -- municipal   utilities and irrigation districts -- believe they aren't required to   participate in blackouts prompted by financial disputes.   And SMUD, which has been considering dropping out of future blackouts, will   be watching the response to Lodi, said SMUD board President Larry Carr.   Some SMUD directors say they're ready to go to court to force the issue. So   is Lodi, population 58,000, said Vallow.   \"I've heard an Edison executive describe this as a natural disaster akin to   an earthquake. That's crap. This is a man-made event,\" he said.   Lodi said it will still help in genuine emergencies, such as fires or toppled   transmission lines. But it decided that on Monday and Tuesday that wasn't the   case.   \"You have 3,000 megawatts of QFs (qualifying facilities) offline because   their bills haven't been paid. Well, guess what? Somebody ought to pay those   ... bills,\" Vallow said.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------      Blackouts hit for second day; break seen Wednesday           By Audrey Cooper  ASSOCIATED PRESS   March 20, 2001   SACRAMENTO  ) Rolling blackouts hit California for a second straight day   Tuesday, closing souvenir shops in San Francisco's Chinatown, snarling   traffic and plunging schools and offices around the state into darkness.   Roughly a half-million homes and businesses from San Diego to the Oregon   border faced outages, blamed on the same factors that collided to force   blackouts Monday  ) unseasonably warm weather, reduced electricity imports   from the Pacific Northwest, numerous power plants offline for repairs and   less power provided by cash-strapped alternative-energy plants.   Five rounds of outages in San Diego affected about 74,000 customers. State   power grid officials expected to have enough electricity to avoid further   outages through at least Wednesday, although the supply remained tight.                   State power regulators working on energy rescue   Federal regulators scored for not ordering more California refunds   ?         Gov. Gray Davis blamed the blackouts in part on the failure of Southern   California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to pay millions of dollars   they owe \"qualifying facilities,\" power suppliers that use cogeneration  )   steam from manufacturing plus natural gas  ) or solar, wind and other   renewable energy to generate electricity.   State power grid officials say California this week has lost about half the   electricity QFs normally provide. Several cogeneration plants say they   haven't been paid by Edison and PG&E for weeks and can't afford to buy   natural gas to fuel their plants.   Davis said the utilities are taking in money from customers but still failing   to pay the QFs. The state has been spending about $45 million a day since   January to buy power for customers of Edison and PG&E, which are so   credit-poor that suppliers refuse to sell to them.   \"It's wrong and irresponsible of the utilities to pocket this money and not   pay the generators,\" Davis said at a Capitol news conference Tuesday evening.   \"They've acted irresponsibly and immorally and it has to stop.\"   Southern California Edison officials said in a written statement that the   utility is intent on paying creditors and working with the PUC to pay QFs for   future power sales. PG&E representatives were out of the office late Tuesday   night and didn't immediately return calls from The Associated Press seeking   comment.   John Harrison of the Northwest Power Planning Council, a consortium that   monitors power use in several Western states, said blackouts on the first day   of spring are an ominous sign of what lies ahead this summer.   \"We're in trouble,\" he said. \"We will likely be able to meet our needs this   summer, but there won't be much to send to California.\"   Tuesday's outages began at 9:30 a.m. PST and continued in 90-minute waves   until about 2 p.m., when the Independent System Operator lifted its blackout   order.   Grid officials credited an influx of power from the Glen Canyon hydroelectric   plant on the Utah-Arizona border.   The blackouts were blamed for at least one serious traffic accident.   Two cars collided at an intersection without traffic lights in the Los   Angeles suburb of South El Monte, leaving two people with serious injuries,   California Highway Patrol Officer Nick Vite said.   Ventura Foods in Industry sent its employees out for an early lunch after   blackouts shut down its phones and computers.   \"This is mild weather for this time of year. I don't know what's going to   happen in the summer,\" manager Frank Hynes said. \"This is going to have a   serious impact on the state's economy. They can't just keep shutting people   down.\"   Statewide, demand was higher than expected because of warm spring weather.   Temperatures reached record highs across California on Monday, including the   80s and low 90s in Southern California. They were expected to be somewhat   lower Tuesday but still in the 70s and 80s.   The ISO hoped demand would start to subside and conservation would kick in,   but that did not happen Tuesday morning.   \"We have not seen the kind of conservation we saw back in January,\" when the   first blackouts hit, ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said. \"If we don't have   conservation efforts, that just means that's more power we have to take off   the grid.\"   In San Francisco's Chinatown, souvenir shops normally bustling with visitors   were forced to shut down. Nearby, irritated customers waited for a bank to   reopen.   \"It's no good for anybody  ) stores or businesses or people,\" said Yin Sun   Chan, among those in line.   PG&E, the state's largest utility, accounted for most of the customers   affected.   At least 438,000 PG&E residential and business customers were affected as of   early afternoon, spokesman Ron Low said.   Edison cut power to about 50,000 customers. Edison was ordered to cut less   power than PG&E and saved some due to conservation programs, including one   that lets the utility shut off air conditioning for 118,500 residential and   business customers when the power supply is tight.   About 73,400 San Diego Gas & Electric customers were hit by the blackouts.   Los Angeles, whose municipal utility is not on the grid that serves most of   California, wasn't included in the blackout order.   More than 1 million homes and businesses statewide experienced outages   Monday.   California's power crisis is expected to get even worse this summer, when   temperatures soar and residents crank their air conditioning.   Natural gas supplies are tight, water supplies are down and the state is   spending tens of millions of dollars each day to buy electricity for Edison   and PG&E, who say they are nearly bankrupt due to high wholesale power costs.   Edison and PG&E say they have lost more than $13 billion since last June to   climbing wholesale electricity prices the state's 1996 deregulation law   prevents them from recouping from ratepayers.   Adding to the problems, the state this week lost about 3,100 megawatts from   QFs. One megawatt is enough power to serve about 750 households.   The plants say they are owed about $1 billion for past sales to PG&E and   Edison.   PG&E said it is offering to prepay the QFs starting next month to get them   back in operation. Negotiations were expected to continue Wednesday.   California Co-Generation Council attorney Jerry Bloom said he supports   proposals that will get the Qfs paid, but the promise of future payments may   not be enough.   PG&E and Bloom said the utility's prepayments hinge on an upcoming Public   Utilities Commission decision on whether the utility's rates are sufficient   to pay its bills and cover the state's power purchases on its behalf, which   amount to $4.2 billion since early January.   Davis said the PUC planned to issue a draft order late Tuesday directing the   utilities to pay their future QF bills.   It plans to take action on that order next Tuesday, Davis said. The   Legislature plans to approve a bill in the meantime giving the PUC the   authority to issue such an order and fine the utilities if they fail to   comply, he said.   Davis said he is confident the utilities and the state can pay their bills   without further rate increases for Edison and PG&E customers.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------      State power regulators working on energy rescue           By Karen Gaudette  ASSOCIATED PRESS   March 20, 2001   SAN FRANCISCO  ) State power regulators continue to delay the release of   guidelines that will determine a portion of the money the Department of Water   Resources can recoup from financially troubled utilities for electricity it   has bought on their customers' behalf.   These guidelines will help the water department determine whether it must   raise consumer power rates to reimburse the state for the more than $3   billion it has committed to buying electricity.   Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, said Tuesday that the Public   Utilities Commission would likely have to raise rates by 15 percent to cover   the state's costs and the utilities' bills.   The PUC guidelines were most recently delayed by a letter from DWR Director   Thomas Hannigan asking that the water department receive a percentage of   ratepayer money collected by the utilities equal to the percentage of   electricity it provides to utilities.   The DWR currently buys around 40 percent of the power used by Pacific Gas and   Electric Co., Southern California Edison Co. and San Diego Gas and Electric.   Under the DWR's proposal the utilities would have to hand over 40 percent of   the money they continue to collect from ratepayers.   The DWR would then also receive whatever money remains after the utilities   subtract their own generation and long-term contract costs, the letter said.   That amount would become the \"California Procurement Adjustment\"  ) an amount   that will help the state retrieve money spent on power purchases and help   establish the size of state revenue bonds that are currently estimated to   total $10 billion.   The state plans to issue the bonds in May to help pay off the more than $3   billion Gov. Gray Davis' administration has committed to power purchases   since January to help the utilities climb out of debt.   Ron Low, a spokesman with PG&E, said the utility objects to paying the DWR   such a large sum, claiming it would interfere with efforts to pay its   \"qualifying facilities\"  ) power plants that use the sun, wind, biomass or   natural gas to generate about one third of the state's electricity.   The nearly bankrupt utilities owe the QFs more than $1 billion for   electricity they have produced since November, said Jan Smutney-Jones,   executive director of the Independent Energy Producers.   Hannigan also said in the letter the DWR intends to use its authority to   raise consumer electricity rates to recoup any money not reimbursed through   the CPA and other means.   The Public Utilities Commission expected to release the guidelines last week,   but was delayed by debates over legislation that would slash the rates of   environmentally friendly power plants under contract to provide electricity   to the investor-owned utilities.   Without knowing how much ratepayer money the utilities need to pay these   \"qualifying facilities\" for future electricity, it's unknown how much money   they'll have on hand to pay the DWR.   In a written statement, PUC Administrative Law Judge Joseph DeUlloa said that   he would issue a temporary decision on the CPA \"as soon as is practical.\"   Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison Co. say they have   lost more than $13 billion since last June to climbing wholesale electricity   prices that the state's 1996 deregulation law prevents them from recouping   from ratepayers.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------        Federal regulators scored for not ordering more California refunds           By H. Josef Hebert  ASSOCIATED PRESS   March 20, 2001   WASHINGTON  ) House Democrats asked federal energy regulators Tuesday why they   are not going more aggressively after alleged overcharges for wholesale   electricity in California and ordering more refunds.   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has asked suppliers to justify $124   million in sales during the first two months of the year or refund the money,   but critics charge that thousands of additional questionable sales are not   being challenged.   The three commissioners testifying at a hearing of the House Commerce   subcommittee on energy, were asked why they limited their refund demands to   only power sales that occurred during so-called Stage 3 alerts of acute power   shortages in California.   \"It appears to me a price is unreasonable when it is unreasonable,\" and not   just during a power alert, said Rep. Rick Boucher of Virginia, the panels'   ranking Democrat.   The commission last week ordered six power generators to justify some 1,000   transactions during February in the California market whenever the price was   above $430 per megawatt hour and occurred during a Stage 3 emergency alert.   But the lawmakers were told Tuesday that 56 percent of another 14,168   transactions, occurring outside a Stage 3 emergency, also exceeded the $430   trigger, but are not being questioned.   \"The line was drawn to limit the scope of the refund,\" said agency   commissioner William Massey, a Democrat, who strongly opposed the refund   actions because he said they were too limited.   Chairman Curtis Hebert, a Republican, defended the way the commission decide   on what transactions to challenge saying that it sought to replicate market   conditions as they existed at the time of the sales.   \"We deserve a better explanation,\" retorted Boucher.   Massey said that agency's investigation of overcharges for January also   failed to consider thousands of transactions that exceeded the refund trigger   because they did not occur during Stage 3 supply emergencies.   Managers of California's electricity grid, state regulators and utilities   have accused the agency of refusing to aggressively investigate price gouging   by wholesalers who have charged from $150 to $565 per megawatt hour, as much   as 20 times what prices were in 1999.   While Hebert and commissioner Linda Breathitt defended the commissioners   attempt to investigate whole electricity prices, Massey has been highly   critical.   What message does the agency's scrutiny of prices send to the power   companies? he was asked.   \"It makes clear FERC is going to be looking for the wallet under the lamp   post with the lights shining  ) and nowhere else,\" replied Massey.   Meanwhile, Massey and his two fellow commissioners, also disagreed sharply on   whether the energy agency should impose temporary price controls on the   wholesale power market in the West to dampen further expected price increases   this summer.   Massey said he fears \"a disasters in the making\" if some price restraints are   not imposed by FERC, which regulates wholesale electricity sales. \"We need a   temporary time out,\" he said.   But Massey is in the minority on the commission. Both Hebert and Breathitt   are against price caps, arguing they will have long-term detrimental impact   on power supply.   The Bush administration has made its opposition to interfering in the   wholesale markets well known for weeks. Vice President Dick Cheney's task   force is to unveil an energy plan in about a month that is expected to lean   heavily on energy production.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------  Second Day of Blackouts Disrupts 500,000 Homes and Businesses     Power: Grid operators say the shortage should ease in the next few days, but   officials see a grim summer.     By MITCHELL LANDSBERG and ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writers             A traffic signal that stopped working during Tuesday's rolling blackouts led   to this collision be tween a car and a truck at an intersection in El Monte.   The outages ran from 9:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. AP    ?????Electricity blackouts rolled through California for a second straight   day Tuesday, disrupting business in one of the world's most technologically   advanced economies and leaving schoolchildren groping in the dark.  ?????Jinxed by a combination of bad luck and bad decisions, utilities were   forced to cut off power to more than half a million homes and businesses from   San Diego to the Oregon border.  ?????By day's end, there was some good news from the operators of the   statewide power grid, who said the situation had eased and appeared likely to   improve for the next few days. And Gov. Gray Davis announced a proposed   solution to one vexing problem: the utilities' failure to pay the state's   small, alternative power generators, many of whom have stopped producing   power as a result.  ?????Davis called the utilities \"shameful\" for failing to pay, and praised   the alternative power generators, which include solar, wind and geothermal   energy producers, as \"good corporate citizens\" who produced power although   they weren't being paid.  ?????\"We are anxious to pay the [small producers], who are dropping like   flies,\" Davis said.  ?????Despite the progress, it was hard for some people to look on the bright   side after enduring outages that took place when the state's hunger for power   was almost 50% less than at its summer peak.  ?????\"This is a taste, almost like an appetizer, of a really unpalatable meal   that's going to be served up this summer,\" said Michael Shames of the Utility   Consumers' Action Network in San Diego, himself a victim of a rolling   blackout that hit his office in San Diego early Tuesday.  ?????Power officials have warned that this could be a grim summer in   California, since demand for electricity sharply rises when people turn on   air conditioners. The state has been struggling to meet its power needs in   recent months because of rising prices and a flawed deregulation plan that   has left the two biggest private utilities on the brink of bankruptcy. State   leaders have so far failed to agree on a comprehensive plan to solve the   problems.          Wally Quirk teaches a business class in a borrowed classroom Tuesday at   Sonoma State after the state's rolling blackouts cut the power to his usual   classroom, which does not have any windows.  SCOTT MANCHESTER / The Press Democrat    ?????The latest round of blackouts began about 9:30 a.m. Tuesday when the   California Independent System Operator, which runs the statewide grid,   determined that the demand for electricity was 500 megawatts more than the   supply--an imbalance that meant the state was short on the power needed to   supply electricity to about 375,000 homes.  ?????Grid operators blamed a confluence of events, including warmer weather;   outages at several major power plants, including one unit of the San Onofre   nuclear power station; a reduction in imports from the Pacific Northwest, and   the shutdown of many alternative energy producers. Similar blackouts Monday   were the first since January.  ?????The situation improved somewhat by late Tuesday morning, with some   supplies restored and Californians conserving energy, and Cal-ISO was able to   halt the rolling blackouts at 2 p.m.  ?????Once again, customers of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power   were spared, although the municipally owned utility said its electrical   surplus was smaller than usual. The DWP, like Southern California Edison, was   affected by an outage at the huge Mohave power plant in Nevada, as well as by   planned outages at several of its facilities.  ?????As in the past, by far the biggest impact was felt by customers served   by Pacific Gas & Electric, the state's largest utility, which cut power to   438,000 homes and businesses.  ?????Edison cut power to 47,462 customers in about 40 cities, but eventually   was able to avoid blackouts by shutting off the air conditioners of some of   the 118,500 customers who participate in a voluntary cutoff program.  ?????San Diego Gas & Electric cut power to 73,400 customers.    ?????Innovative Ways of Coping  ?????As on Monday, most people took the outages in stride, as an annoying but   ultimately unavoidable inconvenience.  ?????In Palmdale, four schools lost power during one of the hourlong   blackouts, but teachers and students pressed on in the sunlight pouring   through windows and skylights. At Barrel Springs Elementary, Principal Cruz   Earls said the biggest problem came when students had to go to the bathroom:   Hand in hand, they made their way through darkened hallways with flashlights.  ?????All in all, it wasn't a terrible experience. Then again, the weather   wasn't that hot Tuesday, with a high of 79 in Palmdale, so the shutdown of   air conditioners wasn't much of a hardship. \"I don't want to think about the   conditions this could create in May or June,\" Earls said.  ?????Businesses of all kinds complained about the lack of warning for the   outages--and sometimes found innovative ways to get around the problem.  ?????Rattled by news reports of Monday's rolling blackouts, El Burrito   Mexican Food Products in the city of Industry started its Tuesday shift at 2   a.m. to beat the clock in the event of an outage. That hunch paid off.   Workers had just finished cooking and packaging the last batches of salsa and   masa when the lights went out at 10:20 a.m.  ?????Company owner Mark Roth said the firm will continue working odd hours to   avoid further outages. But he isn't buying the line from the utilities that   they can't provide advance warning because of concerns about looting and   rioting.  ?????\"We're ready to do whatever it takes to get through this thing,\" he   said. \"But they've got to give us some notification.\"  ?????At Big O Tires in Elk Grove, just south of Sacramento, owner Daniel Crum   had his 14 workers take an early lunch break or head to the warehouse to   reorganize the goods. Without electricity, they couldn't repair brakes or   align front ends.  ?????\"I'd never let them be idle,\" said Crum.  ?????At least two minor traffic accidents were blamed on the outages.  ?????The blackouts resulted from a convergence of factors.  ?????Demand was slightly higher than expected, probably because of   unseasonably warm weather. Supplies were tighter than usual, in part because   of several outages, including that at the Mohave plant, half of which was   brought back on line by the end of the day.  ?????The San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station was still limping along   without power from one of its two 1,100-megawatt units, which was shut down   Feb. 3 after a half-hour fire in a nonnuclear part of the plant. Edison,   which operates San Onofre, initially estimated the unit would be out for   several weeks but recently said \"extensive damage\" to parts of the turbine   will keep the unit out of commission until mid-June.  ?????Shipments from the drought-stricken Pacific Northwest, which generates   most of its electricity from large dams, were also down.  ?????\"Each time we take a measurement, we're closer to the all-time record   for the driest year,\" said Dulcy Mahar, spokeswoman for the Bonneville Power   Administration, the network of federal dams that provides the region with   much of its electricity. \"We've been doing what we can, but we simply don't   have power to sell.\"  ?????Finally, there was the problem of the small and alternative energy   producers, which have shut down plants because they haven't been paid by the   private utilities since November. Those outages have cost the state about   3,000 megawatts of electricity, enough for about 2.3 million homes.  ?????\"You're seeing the system freeze up,\" said David Sokol, chairman and CEO   of MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co., which runs eight geothermal plants in the   Imperial Valley through its subsidiary, CalEnergy. His company hasn't shut   down yet, but Sokol said smaller companies couldn't continue to sell their   energy to utilities for free.  ?????\"Why should we fund Edison?\" he asked. \"That's just ridiculous.\"    ?????A Choice of 2 Rate Plans  ?????Davis joined lawmakers in the Capitol on Tuesday to outline his plan to   get the producers running again. He said utilities have had no right to   collect money from ratepayers and then not use the funds to repay the small   producers. The state has spent billions to buy power from large conventional   producers on behalf of the utilities but has refused to pick up the tab for   alternative energy.  ?????\"The utilities acted in a shameful manner by putting money in their   pockets that was designed to pay the [small producers],\" Davis said.  ?????The plan outlined by Davis would allow the generators to choose between   two rate plans. They could decide to be paid 7.9 cents per kilowatt-hour over   five years or 6.9 cents a kilowatt-hour over 10 years.  ?????The utilities must begin paying the generators the new rates beginning   April 1 or face fines, Davis said.  ?????The question of how the companies will get paid the about $1.5 billion   they are owed remains unresolved. That issue will be decided in coming weeks   as Davis' negotiators continue to work on rescue plans for the state's   financially hobbled private utilities.  ?????PG&E spokesman Ron Low said the state's largest utility did not take   kindly to Davis' criticism, and noted that the governor's plan is similar to   a proposal that PG&E made last week to producers.  ?????Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of a trade group that includes some   of the small generators, described the plan as a positive step.  ?????\"The governor got it right in that it's not acceptable for small power   producers to continue to generate and not be paid,\" Smutny-Jones said. \"But   we'll need to see what the order says; the devil will truly be in the   details.\"  ?????Grid operators said the state's overall energy situation eased by midday   Tuesday because of repairs at the Mohave plant and another large plant at   Ormond Beach, and because the Western Area Power Administration came up with   300 megawatts of electricity from Glen Canyon Dam.  ?????Also, grid spokesman Patrick Dorinson said conservation savings spiked   upward after earlier complaints that Californians weren't conserving.  ?????\"We saw the people of California probably conserve 900 megawatts today,\"   he said. \"That was probably the difference.\"  ---   ?????Times staff writers Andrew Blankstein, Jose Cardenas, Marla Dickerson,   Noaki Schwartz, Nicholas Riccardi, Doug Smith, Rebecca Trounson and Richard   Winton in Los Angeles, Miguel Bustillo and Julie Tamaki in Sacramento, Maria   La Ganga in San Francisco, Stanley Allison, Matt Ebnet, Scott Martelle,   Dennis McLellan, Monte Morin, Jason Song, Mai Tran and Nancy Wride in Orange   County, and Richard Simon in Washington contributed to this story.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------  Fragile Supply Network Apt to Fail     By JENIFER WARREN and ERIC BAILEY, Times Staff Writers     ?????A lot of people were caught off guard by the blackouts that swept over   California this week. Debra Bowen wasn't one of them.  ?????As chairwoman of the state Senate Energy Committee, she is   intimately--and painfully--familiar with the state's energy supply. And she   is willing to share a secret: It's a fragile system, capable of collapse at   any time.  ?????That knowledge keeps Bowen awake at night, particularly with the   approach of summer, when power demand surges as Californians get reacquainted   with their air conditioners.  ?????\"I sound a bit less like Chicken Little today, don't I?\" Bowen said   Tuesday, as chunks of the state once again were forcibly darkened. \"I know a   lot of people don't feel we have a problem. But we have a very, very big   problem.\"  ?????With the recent slowdown in Stage 3 emergencies, a sense of calm had   settled over the energy debate, and even some legislators were speaking with   guarded optimism about the hot months ahead.  ?????On Tuesday, however, a creeping sense of doom was almost palpable among   energy watchers, and previous supply forecasts--which predict that the state   may yet escape summer blackouts--were being given a second look.  ?????\"The outages of the last two days are something that Californians are   going to have to get used to for July and August,\" said Michael Zenker,   California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. The   Massachusetts consulting firm is predicting about 20 hours of blackouts this   summer.  ?????At the California Independent System Operator, which manages 75% of the   statewide power grid, officials said the energy cushion the state had in   recent weeks was, in some ways, a phantom caused by heavy imports of power.  ?????Cal-ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said people may have been deluded   into a false state of comfort: \"Maybe there is a tendency to think things   have improved,\" he said. In fact, they haven't.  ?????More than anything, this week's events illustrate the delicate balance   of factors that keep California illuminated, from the multitude of supply   sources to the weather.  ?????Temperatures were higher than usual. Alternative-energy suppliers--who   haven't been paid in months by the cash-strapped utilities--cut their output.   Suppliers in the Northwest--which faces a drought--slashed exports. Equipment   breakdowns and maintenance at power plants--much of it unanticipated--took   13,000 megawatts offline. A utility-run program that gives businesses   discounts in exchange for cutting power during emergencies is all but dead.  ?????\"The fragility of the system is such that a small perturbation can turn   everything upside down very easily,\" said Gary Ackerman, executive director   of the Western Power Trading Forum, a group of electricity generators and   traders.  ?????One factor receiving particular attention is the dip in supply caused by   unscheduled maintenance. To help officials predict available supply,   generators provide an annual maintenance plan that is updated regularly.  ?????In addition, however, facilities sometimes shut down for unexpected   reasons: leaking tubes, burnt-out transformers, cracked turbines and faulty   feed pumps. At one point Tuesday, about 8,200 megawatts were unavailable   because of unscheduled shutdowns. That's enough to supply about 6 million   households, and up from 5,700 megawatts a week ago.  ?????The huge 1,400-megawatt Mohave power plant near Laughlin, Nev., which   supplies Southern California Edison and the Los Angeles Department of Water   and Power, was felled Monday by a transformer problem. That was enough to   push the state into blackouts.  ?????A growing number of skeptics, however, question whether those reasons   are always valid, accusing generators of withholding power to shrink supply   and drive up prices.  ?????\"There's no way to verify it, so you've got to take their word for it,\"   said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who studies California's   electricity market. \"And given that it's very profitable for these things to   occur, you start to wonder if they're creating an artificial scarcity.\"  ?????Tom Williams of Duke Energy said the Houston-based company is working   hard to keep its California power plants, which are capable of producing   3,351 megawatts of electricity, in operation after months of near-continuous   operation.  ?????\"It's like riding a moped across the country,\" he said. \"They're just   not meant to run this hard.\"  ?????Last week, the state Senate formed a committee to investigate charges of   market manipulation by power suppliers. The chairman, state Sen. Joe Dunn   (D-Santa Ana), says the issue of unscheduled plant shutdowns is on his agenda.  ?????\"The problem is: How does one prove that a particular outage was part of   a deliberate strategy to deprive the state of kilowatts, rather than a result   of normal business operations?\" Dunn said.  ---   ?????Times staff writer Nancy Rivera Brooks contributed to this story.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------  Elevator Anxiety Is Riding High     Emergencies: Workers in skyscrapers worry about blackouts trapping them in   their buildings. Some take the risk in stride; others make plans to take the   stairs.     By JOHN M. GLIONNA and JOE MOZINGO, Times Staff Writers     ?????SAN FRANCISCO--In Susan Clifton's highly placed opinion, sunny Tuesday   would have been a picture-perfect day to work atop one of the tallest   buildings in San Francisco, a scenic city littered with soaring skyscrapers.  ?????But Clifton--like many other high-rise office dwellers in blackout-prone   parts of California--couldn't help but feel some high anxiety at the prospect   of being stranded by electrical outages that were sweeping across the state   for a second day.  ?????\"I think about it all the time,\" said Clifton, a 21-year-old   receptionist at Deutsche Bank's offices on the 48th floor of a tower in the   city's financial district who recently moved from rural Virginia. \"The way I   see it, Californians take a lot of things on faith, working atop tall   buildings with all these earthquakes and power outages.\"  ?????For Long Beach office worker Dave Suhada, the anxiety has taken the form   of elevator phobia: a fear of getting stuck on an 80-degree day crammed in a   pod of sweating, heavy-breathing humans, with no way out.  ?????\"I'm just eyeing the buttons to see which one I could push as fast as I   can if the power goes out,\" he said.   ?????For 20-year-old Lisa Riley, it means entering the elevator each day in   her Long Beach office building with a prayer. \"I just could not get stuck for   an hour and a half,\" she said, nodding nervously. Often she now opts for the   stairs.  ?????In San Francisco, emergency services officials say that most of the   city's office buildings are equipped with backup generators to run elevators   and security equipment in the event of a blackout.  ?????Fire Department spokesman Pete House said the city has 19 trucks with   experts trained to extricate people trapped in elevators. Firefighters   handling blackout-related emergencies rescued a person trapped in a downtown   building Tuesday and handled five elevator mishaps Monday.  ?????Christopher Stafford didn't get caught inside an elevator Monday, but   suffered the next-worst thing: being stranded in his 15th-floor apartment   after the power failed when he went home for lunch.  ?????So the 41-year-old real estate worker trooped down the stairs to the   lobby and even made some new friends along the way, helping a few elderly   women who were struggling down the stairs.  ?????\"It was a pain,\" he acknowledged. \"But I have to tell you: I really like   my panoramic view, so it's worth the hassle.\"  ?????Nowadays, Sherrie Tellier makes sure her cellular phone is in hand when   she gets in the elevator. She got trapped once before, and the emergency   phone didn't work. It's amazing, she said, how small an elevator seems when   you can't get out. \"It's like a broom closet.Now there's a sigh of relief   every time the door opens.\"  ?????Some high-rise office workers said Tuesday that they preferred not to   think about the perils of going without power and being vulnerable and   isolated so high up.  ?????But on the 42nd floor of San Francisco's Transamerica Tower, Sasha   Monpere wasn't fazed by the chance that during a blackout, her building's   backup generators wouldn't kick in.  ?????\"Hey, I'm young and I'm healthy. I can always walk down the stairs,\"   said the 29-year-old receptionist. \"I've done the Statue of Liberty. It can't   be any worse than that. And walking down 42 flights is a lot easier than   walking up all those stairs.\"  ?????Likewise with Phil Ip, who works on the 52nd--and top--floor of San   Francisco's tallest skyscraper. The 25-year restaurant veteran says he has   the utmost faith in modern technology.  ?????\"We're safe, even up here,\" said Ip, assistant general manager of the   Carnelian Room, a restaurant atop the Bank of America building. \"You should   see the engineer's room in this building. It's like a big steamship. They're   equipped for anything that could happen.\"  ?????One floor below, Cheryl Martin hears every day about people's fear of   heights. In the year since she began answering phones in a law office, she   has often escorted clients afraid of express elevators that shudder and rise   so fast that passengers' ears pop from the altitude gain.  ?????\"Everybody, and I mean everybody, asks, 'So, what happens during a power   outage?' \" she said.  ?????Rory Thompson said he believes in karma and is sure that if the rolling   blackouts come calling, his office will be spared. In July 1993, Thompson's   building was the site of an incident known as the 101 California St.   massacre, in which gunman Gian Luigi Ferri killed eight people and wounded   six before killing himself.  ?????\"This building has already had its bad day,\" he said. \"They say that the   day after a crash is the safest day to ride an airline. So I'll take my   chances with the rolling blackouts.\"  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  --------------------------------------------------------------------------  State Says It's Accelerating Plan to Buy Power Utilities' Grid     Government: Talks with Edison are reported near completion, but agreement   with heavily indebted PG&E has a way to go.     By RONE TEMPEST and DAN MORAIN, Times Staff Writers     ?????SACRAMENTO--As blackouts hit California for a second day Tuesday, a key   consultant to Gov. Gray Davis said negotiations to buy the power grid owned   by the state's largest utilities \"are proceeding at an accelerated pace.\"  ?????Wall Street consultant Joseph Fichera said talks with Southern   California Edison could be wrapped up within days, although those with PG&E   are much less advanced.   ?????The administration and PG&E have not reached even an agreement in   principle, he said. PG&E, which has more debt than Edison, says its   transmission lines are more extensive than those of its Southern California   counterpart.  ?????The state wants to buy the utilities' transmission lines and other   assets for about $7 billion to provide cash to the utilities, help stabilize   the electricity supply and ease the power crunch that has plagued California   for months. To research the grid purchase, Fichera said, the state has had to   pore over 80,000 documents just to assess the utilities' liabilities.  ?????\"We are working at a good pace,\" said Fichera, chief executive of the   New York firm Saber Partners. \" . . . If we get to a deal-breaker, it might   be longer.\"  ?????By making Fichera, who is also a consultant to the Texas Public   Utilities Commission, available to reporters Tuesday, the Davis   administration was clearly trying to reassure the public that progress is   being made on the governor's plan to pull the state out of the crisis.  ?????Since mid-January, when the big utilities' credit failed and suppliers   stopped selling to them, the state has spent nearly $3 billion buying   electricity from a handful of large suppliers in Texas, Oklahoma, Georgia and   North Carolina. Not a cent has gone to the hundreds of alternative energy   suppliers in California who provide about a quarter of the state's   electricity.  ?????The Monday and Tuesday blackouts occurred partly because many of the   cash-strapped alternative suppliers, including solar, biomass and wind power   units, cut their normal supply to the system in half. They say Edison and   PG&E have not paid them since November; the utilities say they are out of   cash.  ?????Assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek) said the plight of the   alternative suppliers has dragged on because of the complexity of dealing   with \"almost 700 individual contractors.\"  ?????Another delaying factor, said Keeley, who with state Sen. Jim Battin   (R-La Quinta) worked for almost three months to come up with a legislative   plan to lower the small producers' prices, was \"the huge enmity . . .   manifested between the utilities and the qualifying facilities. These people   just don't like each other.\"  ?????This week's blackouts provided two painful lessons for the Davis   administration:  ?????* When it comes to electricity, size doesn't matter--every kilowatt   counts. During peak use, a small wind power facility in Riverside County can   make the difference between full power and blackouts.  ?????* There is no such thing as a partial solution. Unless the whole energy   equation is balanced, the parts don't work.  ?????For the Davis plan to work, several key elements need to come together   or utility customers will almost certainly face rate increases above the 19%   already set in motion:  ?????* The cost of power purchased by the state must be reduced through   long-term contracts with the big out-of-state producers.  ?????These contracts, the details of which the Davis administration has kept   confidential, are still being negotiated by Davis consultant Vikram Budhraja   of the Pasadena firm Electric Power Group. The administration says it has   concluded 40 contracts with generators, about half of which have been signed.  ?????According to the most recent statistics released by the Department of   Water Resources, which buys power for the state, current prices are still   well above the rate state Treasurer Phil Angelides says is necessary for a   planned $10-billion bond offering to succeed.  ?????The bonds, set for sale in May, will be used to reimburse the state for   the money it will have spent by that time to buy electricity. The state is   currently spending at a rate of $58 million a day to buy power. If prices   stay high, the $10 billion in bonds will not cover the state's power   purchases by the end of the summer.  ?????Angelides says he cannot proceed with bridge financing for the bonds   until the Public Utilities Commission devises a formula to guarantee that a   portion of utility bills will be dedicated to bond repayment. Angelides has   estimated that, under the January law that put the state in the power buying   business, the state must be reimbursed $2.5 billion annually, and that $1.3   billion is needed to service the debt.  ?????PUC Administrative Law Judge Joseph R. DeUlloa is expected to announce   his ruling on the reimbursement rate later this week, leading to a PUC vote   on the matter as early as next week.  ?????* The rates charged for electricity by the alternative producers, known   as qualifying facilities, must be cut at least in half, down from an average   of more than 17 cents per kilowatt-hour. In his news conference Tuesday,   Davis said he will ask the PUC to set QF rates at 6.9 cents for 10-year   contracts and 7.5 cents for five-year contracts.  ?????Meanwhile, PUC Chairman Loretta Lynch, a Davis appointee, said Tuesday   that the commission will vote next week on a proposed order requiring   Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric to pay the QFs for   electricity in the future. Lynch said a recent PUC assessment showed that the   utilities have enough cash on hand for that.  ?????\"We are trying to make sure the folks providing the power get paid,\"   Lynch said. \"The qualified facilities have demonstrated that they haven't   been paid and that it is impairing their ability to provide power.\"  ?????The utilities contend that if they pay the small providers what they owe   them, there will not be enough money left to pay other creditors.  ?????\"There is not enough money in the current rate structure to pay the   [alternative producers], pay the [Department of Water Resources] and pay the   utilities for their generation,\" said John Nelson, a spokesman for PG&E.  ?????* The utilities must sell to the state the power they produce   themselves, mainly from hydro and nuclear sources, at a rate only slightly   above the cost of producing it. This is tied to the ongoing negotiations   between the Davis administration and the utilities to restore the   near-bankrupt utilities to solvency.  ---   ?????Times staff writers Julie Tamaki, Miguel Bustillo and Tim Reiterman   contributed to this report.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  --------------------------------------------------------------------------  L.A., Long Beach File Suits Over Gas Companies' Prices     Energy: Separate actions allege a conspiracy and gouging. Suppliers blame   rising demand and a fluctuating market.     By TINA DAUNT and DAN WEIKEL, Times Staff Writers     ?????Seeking damages that could reach \"into the billions of dollars,\" the   cities of Los Angeles and Long Beach on Tuesday filed separate lawsuits   alleging that a coalition of gas companies illegally conspired to eliminate   competition, drive up natural gas prices and discourage the construction of   electricity generating plants in California.  ?????Officials from the two cities alleged that Southern California Gas Co.,   San Diego Gas & Electric and El Paso Natural Gas Co. violated the state's   antitrust law and engaged in unfair and fraudulent business practices that   caused gas prices to skyrocket.  ?????The cities are the first California municipalities to take action   against the gas companies. A number of similar lawsuits filed by antitrust   attorneys, state regulators and private citizens are pending elsewhere.  ?????The energy companies deny any impropriety. They contend that California   is the victim of its own soaring electricity demand and overreliance on   fluctuating spot markets for natural gas.  ?????\"The conspiracy theories that have been promoted have no basis in   reality,\" said Denise King, spokeswoman for Southern California Gas' parent   company, Sempra Energy, which also was named in the suits. \"Southern   California Gas continues to look out for the best interest of its customers.\"  ?????The lawsuits filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court accuse the   companies of conspiring to manipulate the price of natural gas by agreeing to   kill pipeline projects that would have brought ample supplies of cheaper   natural gas to Southern California.  ?????They allege that executives for the energy companies made the pact   during a meeting in a Phoenix hotel room five years ago to discuss   \"opportunities\" arising from the state's newly deregulated electricity market.  ?????\"The fulfillment of the illicit plan has had devastating effects on   Southern California gas consumers,\" according to Los Angeles' suit. \"Gas   prices in the Southern California market have skyrocketed, and the Southern   California gas consumers are paying the highest prices in the nation.\"  ?????In recent months, natural gas prices have tripled across the nation for   a number of reasons, including a shortage of supplies to meet demands for   home heating. Prices have increased far more in California, where natural gas   is a central factor in the state's energy crisis. The state relies on the   clean-burning fuel to generate half its electrical power.  ?????\"This not only led to price-gouging of all natural gas consumers, from   homeowners to government to industry, but it contributed to the current   electrical power crisis in California,\" said City Atty. James K. Hahn, a   mayoral candidate who urged the City Council to pursue the case.  ?????Chris Garner, Long Beach's utility director, said that since November,   the average residential bill for gas in Long Beach has more than doubled, to   $175 a month. Some customers, he said, have seen rate increases of 500%.  ?????\"The people of Long Beach are being gouged by energy conglomerates who   are artificially manipulating the supply of natural gas and reaping excess   profits at the expense of the public,\" said City Attorney Robert Shannon.  ?????Holding a special meeting, the Los Angeles City Council voted 12 to 0   Tuesday to file the suit.  ?????\"If the allegations are true, they are extremely serious,\" said   Councilman Mike Feuer, who is a candidate to succeed Hahn as city attorney.   \"And there appears to be some important evidence that substantiates the   allegations in the complaint, which means that this lawsuit is, I think, more   than a viable lawsuit.\"  ?????Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas added: \"We cannot tolerate this and we   must use the full weight of the law to try to correct it.\"  ?????A growing number of lawsuits around the state are targeting California's   natural gas suppliers. El Paso Corp., which owns the main pipeline   transporting out-of-state gas to Southern California, has been targeted   repeatedly by utility companies, state regulators and antitrust attorneys.   ?????Some of the first antitrust lawsuits were filed against Sempra Energy in   December. They were brought by Continental Forge Co., a Compton-based   aluminum forging business, and Andrew and Andrea Berg, who own a business in   San Diego.  ?????The cities' lawsuits request that the defendant companies be barred from   such conduct in the future, and they seek civil penalties and damages.  ?????Shannon estimates that Long Beach could collect more than $100 million   in damages, including triple penalties for antitrust violations.  ?????\"We are filing this for our citizens,\" Shannon said. \"They include the   poor, the elderly, people living on fixed incomes and small business owners.\"  ?????The Los Angeles suit was filed on behalf of all Californians. Officials   place damage estimates \"in the billions.\"   ?????Hahn, however, warned council members that it could take the city a year   or more to resolve the suit.  ?????\"Lawsuits take time,\" Hahn said. \"We are hopeful we can enter into   meaningful discovery to disclose what's been going on.\"  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  --------------------------------------------------------------------------  Davis OKs Subsidy of Pollution Fees     Smog: As part of secret deal to get long-term energy contracts, state would   pay for some of the credits that allow excess power plant emissions. Critics   renew call for full disclosure.     By DAN MORAIN , Times Staff Writer     ?????SACRAMENTO--As part of his closed-door negotiations to buy electricity,   Gov. Gray Davis has agreed to relieve some generators from having to pay   potentially millions of dollars in fees for emitting pollutants into the air,   Davis said Tuesday.  ?????Davis announced two weeks ago that his negotiators had reached deals   with 20 generators to supply $43 billion worth of power during the next 10   years.  ?????However, the Democratic governor has refused to release any of the   contracts or detail various terms, contending that release of such   information would hamper the state's ability to negotiate deals with other   generators and therefore ultimately would raise prices Californians pay for   electricity.  ?????Sources familiar with the negotiations, speaking on condition of   anonymity, said the agreement reached with Dynegy Inc., a power company based   in Houston, is one that includes language requiring that the state pay the   cost of credits that allow emissions. Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel declined   to discuss the company's deal with the state.  ?????\"We couldn't get them to sign contracts; it was a sticking point,\" Davis   said of the decision to pay the fees of some generators. \"We had to lock down   some power so we were not totally dependent on the spot market.\"  ?????The fees in question are part of an emission trading system known as   RECLAIM. Under the system, companies are allotted a certain amount of   allowable pollution. If their operations pollute more, companies are required   to purchase credits on an open market. Currently the credits cost about $45   per pound of pollution--an amount that can lead to a bill of well over $10   million a year for a power plant.  ?????The South Coast Air Quality Management District, which regulates   pollution in the Los Angeles Basin, is considering steps to significantly   lower the cost of the system--a step that could considerably cut the state's   potential cost, Davis said.  ?????Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey)   defended the decision to cover the power company's costs.  ?????\"It is a question of whether it brings down the price of power,\" she   said. \"If it brings down the price of power, I don't have a problem with it.\"  ?????Nevertheless, word that the contracts could bind the state to pay   pollution fees caused some critics of Davis' policy to renew calls for Davis   to reconsider the secrecy surrounding the power negotiations. The payment   provision underscores the fact that the contracts involve more than merely   the prices the state will pay for its megawatts, the critics note.  ?????\"The Legislature should have known about it,\" said Senate President Pro   Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco). \"It is going to cost taxpayers money. It   makes you wonder. . . . This was a policy issue that was never discussed with   the Legislature.\"  ?????V. John White, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club, who also represents   alternative energy producers, called the contract proposal \"a horrible   precedent.\"  ?????\"Until we know exactly what the state has agreed to and how much of a   subsidy this represents, we can't determine how serious the breach of   principle this is,\" White said.  ?????Another critic of the secrecy of the negotiations, Terry Francke,   general counsel for the California First Amendment Coalition, said the   provision in question \"raises the possibility that there are other   [concessions]\" that have not yet come to light.  ?????In the summer, when demand for power is highest, some generators   probably will exceed pollution limits set by regional air quality management   districts.  ?????To avert blackouts, state officials might ask the companies to keep   plants running. In such cases, some sources familiar with aspects of the   contracts said, the contract language could be interpreted to suggest that   the state would cover any fines--although Davis said Tuesday the state will   not cover the cost of fines.  ?????A recent Dynegy filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission   underscores the rising cost of pollution-related measures. The company, which   is partners with NRG Energy in three California plants in El Segundo, Long   Beach and Carlsbad in San Diego County, said its \"aggregate expenditures for   compliance with laws related to the regulation of discharge of materials into   the environment\" rose to $14.3 million in 2000, from $3.6 million in 1999.  ?????A South Coast Air Quality Management spokesman said Dynegy's facilities   appear to be fairly clean--although Sierra Club lobbyist White said Dynegy   has been seeking a permit at one of its plants to burn fuel oil, which is   dirtier than natural gas.  ?????Davis said he intends to \"make this information public,\" but he added   that \"we do not want to put the public's interest in jeopardy by asking them   to pay higher prices.\"  ?????\"Nobody likes the notion that [the administration is] not being fully   forthcoming,\" Davis said. \"But I also have a corollary responsibility that I   don't stick these generators with a higher rate.\"  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  --------------------------------------------------------------------------  As Losses Mount, Companies Work Around Outages     By MARLA DICKERSON,JERRY HIRSCH and NANCY CLEELAND, Times Staff Writers     ?????As blackouts moved from theory to reality, many Southern California   businesses spent Day 2 assessing their losses and digging in for what they   expect to be a long, hot summer.  ?????An hour without electricity may be an inconvenience for most residents.   But for manufacturers and many other businesses, even a brief loss of power   can generate tens of thousands in losses.  ?????Whether shaping metal or making salsa, businesses of all kinds   complained Tuesday about the lack of warning of impending outages, even as   they sought sometimes creative ways to work around the loss of power.  ?????Rattled by news reports of Monday's rolling blackouts, Industry-based El   Burrito Mexican Food Products started its Tuesday shift at 2 a.m. Workers had   just finished cooking and packaging the last batches of salsa and masa when   the lights went out at 10:20 a.m.  ?????\"We dodged a bullet,\" said El Burrito founder Mark Roth. \"Losing a day's   production of salsa would have cost me $15,000 to $20,000.\"  ?????But other companies weren't so fortunate.  ?????Long Beach-based Delco Machine & Gear was still totaling up its losses   from Monday's blackout, which amounted to at least $30,000 in lost wages and   production, said Nick Campanelli, vice president of manufacturing. The   company, a division of Florida-based B/E Aerospace Inc., makes parts for the   aerospace industry. The sudden loss of power caused its sophisticated metal   cutting and grinding machines to crash, ruining precision parts in production.  ?????But the losses don't end there. He said employees will need to spend   hours resetting the equipment. Campanelli is particularly irked that the   company received no warning.  ?????\"Five minutes' notice,\" he fumed. \"That's all I needed.\"  ?????Although businesses such as Campanelli's typically receive no warning   that they are about to lose power, insurance companies count the rolling   blackouts as \"planned events,\" a determination that in most cases   disqualifies a business from making a claim.  ?????\"I know it must be frustrating for businesses who have the power go off   suddenly, but these outages are planned by the grid operators,\" said Pete   Moraga of the Insurance Information Network of California. \"That means it   would not be a covered peril in a traditional business insurance policy.\"  ?????Typically, business insurance covers loss of profit and damage from   unforeseen events such as fires or windstorms. The component of the policy   that covers interruptions in business kicks in after a given amount of time   elapses, usually 24 to 48 hours.  ?????Business polices can be written to include unusual coverages, Moraga   said, but he has never heard of a policy that covers losses from a rolling   blackout.  ?????Some companies are taking measures not to get caught in a situation   where a blackout can hurt them.  ?????The region's largest steel supplier shut down for two hours Monday after   Southern California Edison called to warn of tight supplies.  ?????\"We just can't take a chance,\" said Lourenco Goncalvez, president of   California Steel Industries Inc. in San Bernardino County. \"We have a lot of   safety issues. People could get hurt.\"  ?????Goncalvez said the plant has multiple 20-ton and 25-ton overhead cranes   that operate with electromagnetic devices, which would fail if they lost   power suddenly. Falling materials could injure workers below, he said. \"We   have been asking to be exempt from rolling blackouts,\" he said.  ?????Goncalvez said he couldn't put a price on the lost production at the   24-hour plant and said he worried more about the long term.  ?????\"Two hours is nothing,\" he said. \"My concern is this thing will start to   happen almost every day. If it will be like this all summer, you can be sure   it will have dramatic consequences for the entire economy. . . . We're going   to have a shortage of steel products in California. Maybe the government does   not consider this is serious. We'll see.\"  ?????At Sport Chalet, a La Canada Flintridge-based chain of 22 sporting goods   stores in Southern California, an administrative assistant monitors the state   power situation, hoping to warn any stores that are in danger of losing   power, said Craig Levra, the company's chief executive.  ?????Levra said the assistant was assigned the monitoring duties last year,   when rolling blackouts were still only a threat.  ?????The chain put in place an emergency plan--similar to what it would do in   a major earthquake. Backup power will kick on emergency lights and allow the   cash registers to complete transactions. Employees are instructed to escort   customers from the building safely, Levra said.  ?????Other businesses, however, have plans to remain open during the 60- to   90-minute blackouts.  ?????When power went out at two Cheesecake Factory restaurants in Orange   County on Monday afternoon, the eateries switched to serving cold dishes such   as sandwiches and salads, said Howard Gordon, senior vice president of the   Calabasas Hills-based chain.  ?????The restaurants had enough backup power to operate emergency lights and   cash registers. Large windows provided the rest of the light, Gordon said.  ?????So far, the 99 Cents Only Stores chain has missed the shotgun pattern of   the blackouts. But with nearly 100 stores in California, company President   Eric Schiffer believes it is only a matter of time before the lights go out   at one of its outlets.  ?????Though the stores have some backup power, the chain has systems in place   to operate without it. Its cash registers can open mechanically, Schiffer   said. Because an item sells for a multiple of 99 cents, sales clerks are   equipped with \"blackout sheets\" that calculate a customer's tab, including   tax. All the clerk has to do is count the number of items in the shopping   cart and check the tables on the sheet.  ?????This week's power crunch has been exacerbated by the fact that so-called   interruptible electricity customers no longer face large penalties if they   decline to shut down their operations when supplies get critically low.  ?????The Public Utilities Commission suspended the fines in January to ease   the burden on about 1,400 businesses that found themselves bearing the brunt   of the crisis to prevent rolling blackouts in the rest of the state.  ?????According to Edison, about 10% of its interruptible customers are   complying with requests to curtail electricity usage during crunch time. But   Scott Keller isn't among them.  ?????The owner of Chino-based STC Plastics Inc. said he was forced to shut   down more than 20 times since September, costing him as much as $10,000 in   lost production per day. He ignored requests Monday and Tuesday to curtail   usage and said he doesn't feel a twinge of remorse.  ?????\"If I'm shut down, I can't pay my workers,\" he said. \"I'd feel more   guilty about that.\"  ?????But this is one area where insurance eventually might help. Moraga said   some carriers are developing plans that would cover penalties for continuing   to use power after they have been asked by a utility to cut back.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  --------------------------------------------------------------------------  Wednesday, March 21, 2001   A Blackout on Answers   Davis needs to do a better job in communicating to Californians about the   electricity crisis. In the absence of that, cynicism grows.     ?????The oil shocks of the 1970s, from the Arab oil embargo to the Iran-Iraq   war, were dead simple compared with the California power shortage. Then, the   problem was a lack of imported oil and the chief symptom was long lines and   high prices at gas stations. Politicians urged conservation: Turn down the   heat, drive fewer miles, buy more efficient cars. People understood the cause   of the crisis and the benefit of their actions. Today it's a different story   and a damnably complicated one that gives consumers no place--or actually,   too many places--to focus their anger.   ?????The last two days of rolling blackouts, including previously exempt   Southern California, have not reduced power demand, or at least not enough.   Consumers are suspicious: Are out-of-state power companies holding back   production? Did utilities really not have enough money to pay alternative   energy producers--the little guys who, combined, could produce enough power   to prevent the blackouts? And what happened to long-term power contracts, the   state-bargained deal that was supposed to stabilize the crisis?   ?????The frustrations are vast, and there are too many gaps in the story. If   it's just a pack of thieves creating an artificial shortage, as even some   consumer organizations charge, why should anyone sacrifice to conserve? That,   in a nutshell, is the problem that Gov. Gray Davis, the state Legislature and   the Public Utilities Commission face.   ?????Davis, for one, has to level with the public and stop acting as if he   can fix the crisis. He has proved he can't, at least not without reductions   in usage and, most likely, rate increases. If Davis, who is notoriously   averse to delivering bad news, had leveled with the public about the   fragility of the current system, the last two days of blackouts statewide   (except in places with full municipal power, like Los Angeles) might not have   come as such a shock.   ?????The Legislature tried and failed earlier to solve the alternative energy   producers' nonpayment problems with a very complicated bill. Tuesday night,   Davis and legislators announced a simpler plan that would set lower, more   flexible rates for alternative power but also force the utilities to pay for   future purchases.   ?????Which leads to the utilities themselves. With the state shelling out   billions for power from the major generators, how could Southern California   Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric still not have the cash flow to pay the   alternative producers? That motley collection of biomass, solar, wind and   cogeneration companies has been shutting down for nonpayment--some of them   because natural gas suppliers have cut them off. PG&E has made some payments,   but SCE has paid zilch, though a spokesman says it hopes to strike a deal to   start paying this week.   ?????Without enough honest information, conspiracy scenarios fill the holes.   Bad news is better than no news, something Davis seems not to quite realize.   By today or Thursday, the weather will cool and some plants taken down for   repair will come back online. The blackouts may cease but the crisis will be   just as deep as it was Monday and Tuesday. It is up to Davis to do a better   job of persuasively explaining why. Otherwise, the cynicism grows.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  --------------------------------------------------------------------------  Wednesday, March 21, 2001   Rolling Blackouts: Blatant Extortion     ?????* Re \"Rolling Blackouts Hit Southland for First Time as Production   Falls,\" March 20:   ?????So here we are, 22 years after the notorious gas shortage, having   another gun held to our head by an opportunistic energy consortium. Back in   1979, we all had to wait in long lines just to pay more for gasoline. Now, we   have to face food in our freezers thawing and simmering in our homes during   hot summer days, just to earn the honor of paying more for electricity.   ?????Of course, as soon as the rates are up and the environmental concerns   are shoved aside, watch how plentiful power will be. When is somebody in   government going to stand up for the consumer and stop this blatant form of   extortion?   ?????JOHN JOHNSON   ?????Agoura Hills",

		"_body" : "      After trying most of the week to reach John Sommer at Oneok, I received two calls this morning, one from Kevin Willt (Bushton Plant) and the other from Steve Winston regarding the Bushton measurment issues.  Kevin just wanted to let me know that he would be their measurement contact for day to day operations issues at the Bushton plant and wanted the phone number for Kenneth Cessac.  He said he would be getting with Kenneth about the April/May differences between metered volumes and PTR and would be working with Kenneth going foward on the day to day measurement issues.      Steve Winston wanted to discuss a number of issues.  Here's how that discussion went.  This may be far more detail than anyone wants but since I'm just jumping into this I want to make sure everyone knows what's taking place.  If you want far less detail going foward, please let me know.       Steve asked what our plan was.  I told him that we were waiting for their technical expert to get with Ken Cessac to look at the April/May differences (this was based on Ken's call to John Sommer last week) and that I had been trying to get with John Sommer to set up a meeting as a follow-up to his discussions with Phil to talk about their concerns and need for further clarification to the Measurement Agreement.  Steve informed me that John Sommer would no longer be in the picture as a result of recent org changes and that we should work with he and Terry Spencer.     He stated that Blaine Bender, their Kansas Operstions Manager, and Kevin Willt, their Bushton plant measurement person are supposed to be getting with Ken Cessac to look at the April/May differences.  I told him that I had just talked to Kevin.  They have hired Steve Stark as their technical expert/consultant to work on this.  He stated that the arbitration hearing had \"given us a clean slate\" and that the metered volume/PTR comparisons in June, July and August looked pretty good with both sides of the plant running but that April and May were a still a concern to them.  They're desire is to look into it and \"let the science prevail\" on these months.  I told him that our position, based on the arbitration decision, was pretty clear, that being that our metered volumes prevail, a comparison is really indifferent.  He did not respond all that well to this statement and said that we both have to work together on this issue going forward.  I told him that we would certainly work with them to look at the April and May differences and that if that look/see showed anything we would certainly consider it but reemphasized that the measurment agreement is the basis for our business decisions.      He then wanted to know what needed to be done from the standpoint of the measurement agreement.  I told him that we were open to listening to their concerns and if we needed to get together for a meeting, that we could get one set up.  I asked if he could share some of his thoughts on what they were thinking.  Here's a bullet list of some of the things he brought up.      They want to build a relationship with us where both sides openly share their measurement data and information as is relates to metered volumes and PTR.      They have no long term confidence in the ultrasonic measurement without a comparison to PTR.  He also brought up the issue of two phase flow as temperatures begin to cool this fall and condensate starts come up the pipe.    They propose that the agreement be redone in such a way that it is more \"self correcting\" and that compares the metered volumes to PTR.  And as long as this comparison falls within certain tolerances, then there would be no adjustments.  While he didn't want to commit to a tolerance, he did give a \"Steve Winston opinion\" of around 1%.  He described the process as a \"self correcting\" process. Not real clear what that means.      He also stated that they would want to define a level of exceedance that would require a joint investigation of the problem and defined resolution process.      I asked if as a starting point, he would generate a list of their proposed change provisions and send that to me.  He said he was already working on it, he called it \"Bushton PTR Measurement Settlement\" and would get a bullet list to me in the next couple of days that we could start looking at.  We agreed that we would start from here and then see where it takes us.    ",

		"_body" : "Steve and Shelley,  Included in our 2002 general plant capital was a $50,000 item to replace UPS (Uninterruptable Power Supply) A which provides the power for Gas Control on EB42 and also serves Enron Security. Within Gas Control it supports the Gas Control Center, the Computer Room, and the Mux Room. Randy Lord had recommended that we plan on replacing UPS A in 2002 due to it's age and other issues. UPS systems generally cost a good deal more than $50K but we hoped to leverage some of the UPS equipment in the Enron building that would become available.   For the past 2 months we have been working with Charles Upshaw to determine what existing equipment we could utilize and what the cost would be. For various technical reasons the newer, available UPS systems could not be used to replace UPS A without costly modifications. In the end, a much cleaner, cheaper, and effective approach was to leverage the 50KVA UPS on level EB44 and simply run a new feeder to a new panel on EB42. Option A below describes the recommended approach and the estimated cost. Instead of replacing UPS A, we will simply provide a redundant power supply to the computer room and mux room equipment, continuing to maintain UPS A for as long as it makes sense. The UPS on Level 44 will also provide conditioned and reliable power to several small areas on level 44. In addition to being very cost effective, this approach gives us redundancy for several single points of failure in the existing system.   Charles Upshaw, James Sumpter, John Wilhelm, and I recommend proceeding with Option A. Please reply to this note with your approval and/or any questions or concerns.  Thanks, Gary x33094",

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Co. (ENE) closed on the remaining $450 million of a previously announced $1 billion in secured credit lines and said it is in active discussions to restructure its debt to improve liquidity.  In a press release Wednesday, Enron said the $450 million credit facility is secured by the assets of Enron's Northern Natural Gas Co.  A $550 million credit facility, secured by the assets of Enron's Transwestern Pipeline Co., closed Nov. 16. The proceeds are being used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.  The company said the maturity on its $690 million note payable obligation will be extended to mid-December.  Dow Jones Corporate Filings Alert reported Monday that Enron is currently preparing a restructuring plan aimed at taking aggressive steps to rationalize the company's existing cost structure, accelerating the process of divesting noncore businesses and assets and restructuring scheduled maturities of debt and other obligations.     The Death Of A Pipedream Pamela Williams  11/24/2001  Australian Financial Review  Page 22  Copyright of John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd  Some of the biggest names in Washington have been long associated with the dream of opening up the rich energy fields to rival Gulf oil. But the war in Afghanistan has killed off one of the most ambitious projects.  The web site of the US oil giant, Unocal, tells a tale of corporate power in hiding. It is a blunt statement of repudiation, far from the covetous plans of the 1990s for crossing Afghanistan with pipelines rich with oil and gas.  Instead, in an admission of defeat, the company has posted the message: ``Unocal does not have nor do we plan to have any projects in Afghanistan. We do not support the Taliban in any way whatsoever.''  Hailed as the biggest single economic event of the 21st century with more oil and gas than Saudi Arabia's fabled reserves the project was a multi-billion dollar pipeline, bringing gas from the prime Turkmenistan reserves, across Afghanistan, to the huge Indian and Pakistan markets. Another pipeline would have carried oil from the Caspian reserves.  But in 1998, the project faced defeat as the civil rights and feminist lobby in the United States took on the oil giants over the suppression of human rights by the fervent Islamic clerics and mullahs of the Taliban. They wrested the attention of the United Nations and forced the hand of then president Bill Clinton. Notwithstanding years of pressure by Unocal and its star-studded array of consultants, Clinton declared that the Taliban's repression of women's rights meant there could be no recognition of the Government in Kabul.  It was a bitter blow for Unocal.  But now, with the Taliban steadily being blasted from power, there is renewed speculation that Unocal might seek to breathe new life into the project, bringing a new frenzy of lobbyists and consultants from the US oil industry into the broken Afghan capital.  Absolutely not, according to Unocal spokesman, Barry Lane. He rejects outright the suggestion that Unocal never gave up the pipeline dream, and pressured new President George W. Bush to re-open the door to the Taliban earlier this year.  ``Why would we want to go back in there,'' Lane demands. ``In the intervening three years since we pulled out, our company has refocused its interests.''  Furthermore, he insists that Unocal never cut deals with the Taliban in the first place. He is keen to paint the company (which is a major donor to the Republican Party), as having moved on to greener pastures.  ``It [the Afghanistan pipeline proposal], had all the earmarks of a very good project. But there was no recognised government and therefore you could not get finance, so the project could not go forward,'' Lane says. ``And we were always an advocate on women's rights and we pressured them [the Taliban] at the time,'' he insists. That's not the way the very influential US lobby group The Feminist Majority remembers it. This organisation rallied women and trade unions across America, and galvanised Hollywood to rally for Afghan women's rights. In the end, the Clintons buckled.  Spokeswoman for The Feminist Majority, Kathy Spillar, says: ``The whole world was willing to look the other way as this Taliban regime stripped women of every human right except to breathe, while it planned on how to exploit these oil interests. Now the eyes of the world are on what this new government will look like. And we're going to be watching the oil interests closely. There are just too many times these brutal regimes have flourished while business interests look the other way.''  The speculation about the continued pressure by oil companies on US foreign policy in Afghanistan has been fed by the publication of a new book which alleges that the oil giants stayed George W's hand on investigating terrorism this year while they tried one last round of diplomacy to secure some concessions from the Taliban.  In Bin Laden: the Forbidden Truth, by Jean-Charles Brisard and Guillaume Dasquie, the authors claim that under pressure from US oil companies, George W. Bush's Administration blocked intelligence agencies from investigating terrorism while it bargained with the Taliban to give up Osama bin Laden in exchange for political recognition and economic aid.  The authors claim that US oil companies and the US relationship with oil-rich Saudi Arabia were the two greatest obstacles to hunting Islamic terrorists. And they assert that until August this year, the US goal was actually to consolidate the Taliban in the hope of finally striking the lucrative pipeline deals.  According to the book, the US re-opened negotiations with Taliban representatives in February this year meetings that continued until August, just a month before New York's World Trade Center was attacked.  The authors claim as their source for this extraordinary revelation, the former deputy director of the FBI, John O'Neill, who for many years led the FBI investigations into Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network.  They say that O'Neill this year complained bitterly that his investigations into bin Laden were blocked by the State Department and the oil lobby connected to President George W Bush. In frustration, O'Neill resigned from the FBI. In a chilling turn of events, he took a new job as head of security at the World Trade Center. He was killed on September 11 in the attack on the twin towers.  Certainly the top layers of George W. Bush's Administration enjoy excellent relations with the American oil giants. Aside from the Bush family's oil background, Vice-President Dick Cheney was until last year the chief executive of energy services giant, Halliburton; the National Security Adviser, Condoleezza Rice, was a director of Chevron through the 1990s, and the Secretaries of Commerce and Energy, Donald Evans and Spencer Abraham, worked for oil company Tom Brown. And Unocal includes on its board of directors, Donald Rice, who was Secretary of the Air Force under the first president Bush.  In its efforts to secure a pipeline deal with the Taliban in recent years, Unocal went to extraordinary lengths.  With consultants on board such as the former US Ambassador to Pakistan, Robert Oakley, the company pursued all opportunities, including donating nearly $US1million to the University of Nebraska to the school of Afghanistan Studies. The money was used in part to set up training programs for Afghans who would work on the pipeline, should Unocal end up in the box seat with the Taliban.  Taliban mullahs visited the US twice, with representatives travelling to Houston in late 1997 as the guests of Unocal, visiting the home of Unocal boss Marty Miller, enjoying the sights, with trips to the zoo and shopping centres. On the side there were talks with the State Department.  All the while, intense fighting raged across Afghanistan between the warlords and the Taliban and amongst the warlords themselves.  The CentGas project, as the Unocal consortium (with its major partner the Saudi company Delta Oil), was known, had to raise its funds by late 1997 to meet its deadlines. But the fighting made it impossible to envision stability and finally the CentGas consortium began to unravel.  The stakes for the oil giant were huge. In February 1998, Unocal's vice-president of international relations, John Maresca, testified before the House Committee on International Relations. Maresca too, was from the family fold, having been George Bush Snr's Ambassador to Cyprus.  He outlined the glittering prospects if only the centre could be made to hold in Afghanistan. Despite two decades of bitter warfare and the suppression of human rights, Afghanistan was still the best option for Unocals' pipelines as far as the company was concerned.  ``The route through Afghanistan is the one that would bring Central Asian oil closest to Asian markets and thus would be cheapest in terms of transporting the oil,'' Maresca said.  And to bring gas, there was the CentGas pipeline.  But as with the oil pipeline, construction could not begin ``until an internationally recognised Afghanistan government was in place. For the project to advance, it must have international financing, government-to-government agreements and government-to-consortium agreements.''  Four weeks later, Bill Clinton, with UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright by his side, dispatched Unocal's hopes, declaring there would be no diplomatic recognition for the Taliban.  In his best-selling book, Taliban, Ahmed Rashid, quoted Yasushi Akashi, the UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs speaking in 1996: ``The outside interference in Afghanistan is now all related to the battle for oil and gas pipelines. The fear is that these companies and regional powers are just renting the Taliban for their own purposes.''  The Taliban may now be all but gone, but the oil and gas reserves in the region mean that Afghanistan has by no means reached the end of its long march with the US oil giants.     Pipeline projects flourish  11/23/2001  Tulsa World  FINAL HOME EDITION  Page 8  (Copyright 2001)  Tulsa-based Williams Cos. Inc., El Paso Corp. and other domestic energy firms are leading a $2 billion-a-year expansion of natural- gas pipelines in the United States, the biggest since the 1960s.  Spurred by a projected 30 percent rise in demand for gas in the next nine years, pipeline companies are building projects that will snake their way from the Great Plains to California, and from Canada to New York.  Falling gas prices and a weakening economy haven't slowed construction. El Paso recently said it plans to spend as much as $1.8 billion on a 750-mile line to bring gas to New York from Nova Scotia, and Duke Energy Corp. announced a $478.1 million expansion of a Canadian line to Boston.  \"We're looking through the short-term cycle,\" said Stephen Beasley, president of El Paso's Tennessee Gas Pipeline unit. \"We're in a transition from a petroleum to a natural-gas economy. If you're building a new boiler, a new home, a new power plant, the principal fuel is natural gas.\"  Houston-based El Paso owns 58,000 miles of interstate pipeline, the biggest U.S. network.  Since 1997, federal regulators have granted construction certificates for 60 onshore and offshore projects that would add 8,110 miles of pipeline with the capacity to move an extra 23.2 billion cubic feet of gas a day. The projects are valued at $10.7 billion.  There are 24 additional projects, worth $4.4 billion, awaiting federal approval for an additional 8 billion cubic feet of capacity and 1,730 miles of pipeline.  This year, about 17 pipeline projects are scheduled for completion, adding 5.5 billion cubic feet in daily capacity and 1,400 miles of new or upgraded pipeline, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.  The construction involves pipelines to new gas reserves, lines to new markets and line expansion to new customers, Beasley said.  The United States has 185,0000 miles of interstate pipelines and 75,000 miles of distribution pipelines. The system can move about 22 trillion cubic feet of gas daily.  Forecasts by the Interstate Natural Gas Association and DOE put 2010 demand close to 30 trillion cubic feet.  Pipeline companies sell line capacity to gas users before starting construction, so the fall in gas prices this year isn't expected to halt construction.  \"These aren't the types of projects you do on speculation,\" said Cuba Wadlington, head of pipeline operations for Williams. \"We aren't selling gas -- we're selling capacity.\"  Williams, also one of the biggest energy traders, has a 27,300- mile pipeline network that spans North America. Its biggest project is a $1.6 billion joint venture with Duke Energy for a line from Alabama to Florida. The pipeline will run 700 miles and carry 1 billion cubic feet of gas.  The company also is working on a $135 million expansion of its Kern River pipeline to California, and is spending $300 million to build a line to the Pacific Northwest from central Wyoming.  Williams plans to spend an additional $6 billion in the next three years on pipeline projects, Wadlington said. The company also is part of a group that announced recently it will draw up a plan to build a pipeline for bringing Alaskan natural gas to markets in the \"lower 48\" states.  The group expects to present a plan to the owners of Alaska's gas reserves and the state by the end of the year to build and run the line by 2008.  Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd., a venture of TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. and Westcoast Energy Inc., owns the right of way to the route.

CREDIT:FROM STAFF AND WIRE REPORTS     N Amer Oil, Gas Industry On High Alert After FBI Warning  11/26/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service  (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  WASHINGTON (AP)--The oil and gas industry is on especially high alert after a Federal Bureau of Investigation warning that Osama bin Laden may have ordered retaliatory strikes against North American natural gas facilities in event of his capture or death, industry sources said Monday.  The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the warning issued by the FBI last week was general and singled out no specific target, but referred specifically to natural gas infrastructure such as pipelines.  There are thousands of miles of gas pipeline, most of them buried, crossing the U.S. and Canada. Thirty interstate gas pipelines carry 90% of the natural gas transported, according to the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America.  One source characterized the warning as similar to one issued earlier this month on potential attacks against West Coast bridges that prompted security alerts, but no evidence of actual terrorist intentions.  The FBI alert prompted the American Petroleum Institute, which is the lead industry group coordinating with the FBI and Energy Department on security matters, to issue a warning to oil and gas companies.  \"We have received uncorroborated information that Osama bin Laden may have approved plans to attack natural gas supplies in the United States,\" said the memo, adding that the information was \"from a source of undetermined reliability.\"  The FBI warning continued that \"such an attack would allegedly take place in the event that either bin Laden or Taliban leader Mullah Omar are either captured or killed.\"  Energy companies have stepped up security at refineries, pipeline pumping stations and other facilities since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington and the U.S. retaliatory attacks in Afghanistan.  There are thousands of miles of natural gas and petroleum pipelines crossing North America, making protection of such lines difficult. Aerial monitoring of pipelines have increased and security has been intensified at pipeline pumping stations, according to industry officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  Also, some detailed information about location of pipelines and other energy infrastructure have been taken off some corporate and government Internet sites. Access to facilities has been tightened as well, officials said.    Enron Is Sued Over 401(k) Plan; Plaintiffs Seek $850M  11/26/2001  Dow Jones News Service  (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) was sued Monday in the latest of at least three purported employee class action suits the company faces over lost 401(k) retirement savings due to the recent collapse of the price of Enron stock.  In a press release Monday, Eli Gottesdiener, a Houston attorney who filed the latest suit on behalf of employees, said it seeks $850 million in plan losses, in part because the company sold Enron stock to its employees knowing the price was artificially inflated.  An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment.  Unlike two similar, recently filed suits against Enron, the latest also contends that Enron offered the stock without the required prospectus.  If proven, the sale without a prospectus \"give workers the automatic right to rescind their purchases and receive their money back with interest,\" Gottesdiener said in a statement.  Enron \"locked down\" the retirement plan from Oct. 17 to Nov. 19, to make administrative changes, which prevented employees from selling Enron shares as the share price collapsed amid growing disclosures of financial problems.  Earlier this month, Houston-based Dynegy Inc. (DYN) offered to buy its far larger competitor in an all-stock deal that values Enron shares at $10.85 a piece, or about $9.2 billion.  Enron later disclosed that its future earnings would be substantially less than expected and shares fell sharply.  Enron currently trades at $4.05 a share, down from their 52-week high of $84.88 a share in December 2000.  The first suit was filed Nov. 13 on behalf of plaintiffs by Campbell Harrison & Wright LLP in Houston. A second was filed last week by Seattle-based Hagens Berman LLP.  -John Seward; Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5400      MOU Signed for 1,700-mile Alaskan Gas Pipeline Project  11/26/2001  Gas Processors Report  (c) 2001 Phillips Business Information, Inc.  A memorandum of understanding has been signed between subsidiaries of six U.S. companies and three Canadian firms to immediately begin developing a proposal to build a 1,700- mile natural gas pipeline being designed to transport Alaskan natural gas from the North Slope to Canada and the lower 48 by 2008. The companies are hoping to present a proposal to producers by year-end. If and when an agreement is reached with the producers, the companies will move forward with the Alaskan portion of the project.  The U.S. companies involved in the project include Williams, Duke Energy, Sempra Energy International, Enron, PG&E Corp., El Paso Corp., while TransCanada PipeLines, Westcoast Energy and Foothills Pipe Lines represent the Canadian parties. The signing of the MOU is significant because it shows a renewed interest in eliminating the historic and other commercial roadblocks to building the project, according to our source.  All of the companies are the original partners in the Alaskan Northwest Natural Gas Transportation Co., which was designed by the President and U.S. Congress to build and operate the Alaskan portion of the project in 1977. The companies dropped out of the project years ago, even though the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission had already received approval for the project. Numerous other federal permits for the construction and operation of the Alaskan Natural Gas Transportation System (ANGTS) are already in place. The statutory framework for the project provides for a quick approval of the remaining permits needed before construction can begin.  \"This is a big step forward in bringing Alaska's natural gas to markets in the Lower 48, said Alaska Senator Frank Murkowski. \"I always have believed that construction of an Alaskan gas transportation system to the Lower 48 is going to take the synergistic efforts of pipeline companies and the oil and gas production companies in cooperation with the State, the federal government and Canada. While this does not guarantee construction of a North Slope gas delivery system, it is a big step in the right direction.\"     Wall Street - Oil, oil, boil and trouble.  11/24/2001  Financial Times - FT.com  (c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved  A short week on Wall Street appeared a very long week for the energy sector, an industry that has - in everything from oil to electricity - succeeded in delivering some stinging surprises to the US economy this year.  Last Sunday, Conoco and Phillips Petroleum jolted merger and acquisition specialists out of their torpor with the year's biggest deal, a $35bn \"merger of equals\" to create the third-largest integrated energy company in the US and the sixth-largest in the world.  Coincidentally, on Monday, ChevronTexaco feted the consummation of its merger with a New York analysts' meeting at which David O'Reilly, the combined group's chief executive, promised higher than expected annual savings of $1.8bn by 2003.  Whether the sector needs another clumsy baptism - the fruit of Sunday's announcement will, inevitably, be saddled with the name ConocoPhillips - is not really at issue. Consolidation that began in the 1990s has left medium-sized energy companies such as Conoco and Phillips with little option but to combine resources for exploration and production in order to compete with \"super-majors\" such as ExxonMobil.  Volatile oil prices - another story of the week - appear to add to the urgency of the combination, although James Mulva, Phillips's chairman and chief executive, denied that was a prime reason for consolidation. After all, the industry has learned to live with volatility.  These are companies that, in just three years, have shrugged off concerns about what would happen if crude oil remained at $10 a barrel, and, at the other extreme, the possibility of crude lingering above $30.  In the short term, the fate of stock prices in the sector may depend on Opec's ability to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat in its confrontation with Norway and, in particular, Russia over calls for a cut in oil output to underpin the world price. Oil stocks, as measured by the Philadelphia Oil Service index, have had a turbulent time since September 11, plummeting initially only to rally back to their levels before the terrorist attacks and then slump again as the wrangling between Opec and non-Opec oil producers burst into the open.  ChevronTexaco, for one, seemed unperturbed by the stand-off. \"If you want a stable price environment, you don't want to be in this business,\" O'Reilly said on Monday. He was talking about the oil price but he might just as easily have been referring to energy stocks.  Energy-related industries - from utilities to pipelines - make up six of the 10 worst-performing sectors over the past month, according to Dow Jones data analysed by CBS Marketwatch.  None, however, has fallen as precipitously or as publicly as Enron, the energy trading company. Its share price at the close on Wednesday was $5.01, down 44 per cent on the week and 94 per cent below its 52-week high of nearly $85. Remember that this was a company that outperformed the Nasdaq Composite Index even as the technology-heavy index rose to its March 2000 peak.  In addition, Enron remained at stratospheric price and valuation levels even after the dotcoms, whose magic dust its online trading operations borrowed, fell to earth.  In the process, its ability to pioneer new trading markets, such as bandwidth, made it the envy of Wall Street's own broker-dealers, jealous of its trading bravado and its share rating.  Two of Wall Street's giants - JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup - are now helping to prop up the group, laid low by its failure to disclose adequately off-balance-sheet transactions that it carried out as part of its rapid expansion. The two banks are advising Enron on a rescue bid from Dynegy, the much smaller rival energy group part-owned by ChevronTexaco, and backing it with $1bn of credit, secured on pipeline assets.  The trigger for this week's sharp decline was Enron's regulatory filing late on Monday, which revealed for the first time to shaken shareholders and bondholders that the group would have to repay $690m of notes next Tuesday because of a downgrade 10 days ago by Standard & Poor's.  Wednesday's announcement that Enron had managed to postpone that deadline until the middle of next month seemed to do little to allay the crisis of confidence about the group's ability to repay its heavy debts. Ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, few share traders seemed to want to hold the stock, which fell 28 per cent on Wednesday alone, and electricity and gas counterparties are also wary of entering long-term contracts in the markets that Enron helped pioneer.  The Enron debacle is a reminder of how quickly fortunes can change. Earlier this year, the well-connected and politically influential Houston-based group was powerful enough to be accused by Californians of playing a key role in provoking the electricity crisis on the west coast.  Now Enron's shares and bonds are trading as though it may go bust. If it does, it could drag down other, weaker energy companies, because of its role as a market-maker, supplying liquidity to the power and gas markets. If the worst fears of some Wall Street bankers are realised there may even be repercussions for the wider financial markets, where Enron lays off the risk of price fluctuations, using derivatives.  andrew.hillft.com.

Volatility Fell Slightly in Light Holiday Trading As Enron Calls, Lilly Puts Attracted Interest By Cheryl Winokur Munk  11/26/2001  The Wall Street Journal  Page B8  (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  NEW YORK -- The options market dozed, as many participants stayed home to recover from too much turkey and football.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange's market volatility index, or VIX, which measures certain Standard & Poor's 100 Index option prices to gauge investor sentiment, remained in a tight range during the abbreviated trading session the day after Thanksgiving. It fell 0.53 to 24.79.  VIX typically ranges between 20 and 30. A rise indicates traders and money managers are becoming anxious about the stock market; a fall shows investor optimism.  Volatility has been dropping from post-Sept. 11 levels in recent weeks amid victories over the Taliban in Afghanistan and interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and other central banks. VIX ranged between 30 and 40 for several weeks following the attacks.  Volatility is likely to remain low, said Mika Toikka, head of options strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston. \"Typically, going into the Thanksgiving and December holidays, we tend to experience a seasonal drift lower in implied volatility. We would expect the same this year, especially in markets outside the U.S. where volatility is still lingering at high levels,\" Mr. Toikka wrote in a recent research note.  The CBOE's Nasdaq Volatility index, or VXN, a sentiment barometer for the technology sector, fell 1.86 to 50.82 while the American Stock Exchange's Nasdaq volatility index, or QQV, dropped 1.03 to 42.74.  Elsewhere in the options market:  Calls in Enron Corp., the embattled Houston energy and trading company, continued to trade briskly, with one investor buying 10,000 January 5 calls and simultaneously selling 12,250 January 10 calls.  More than 14,800 of the January 5 contracts traded, compared with open interest of 3,640, as shares fell 33 cents, or 6.6%, to $4.68. These calls cost $1.40 on the American Stock Exchange where most of the volume was traded.  More than 15,000 of the January 10 contracts traded, compared with open interest of 30,674. These out-of-the-money calls cost 30 cents on the Amex.  Eli Lilly & Co.'s December 80 out-of-the-money puts also were popular Friday, as shares fell 91 cents, or 1.1%, to $82.42. Morgan Stanley cut its rating on the company to neutral from outperform, saying the stock has become too expensive even with Food and Drug Administration approval of its potential blockbuster drug Xigris, which treats septic infections. More than 3,000 of these puts traded, compared with open interest of 6,427. They cost $1.25 on the CBOE, which saw much of the volume.     War is the variable in the oil equation. By IAN BREMNER.  11/26/2001  Financial Times  (c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved  Oil prices are in the news again. Over the past two months, competition for market share and the threat of global recession have caused oil prices to plummet. Investors have regarded this as a positive development, since low energy prices can help resuscitate struggling western economies.  However, the markets may be pricing the wrong end of the equation, for it is supply, not demand, that may prove a shock to the system.  At issue is risk in the Middle East. As the war against terrorism moves beyond the Taliban, the US-led coalition will turn elsewhere to root out supporters of al-Qaeda and other terrorist networks. The top suspects are Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq - oil exporters with 45 per cent of the world's reserves among them.  Pressure on these regimes to change their position on terrorism will mount in the coming months. But with the present governments in place, none is likely to do so. The Saudis and Iranians are unable, the Iraqis unwilling.  While Saudi Arabia has been a military and economic ally of the US, its business and religious leaders have long supported the Taliban and al-Qaeda. Full co-operation with the investigations of September 11 and severance of the financial networks that supported it would critically expose the ruling family.  Meanwhile, domestic opinion in Saudi Arabia runs counter to the interests of the US-led coalition. For Crown Prince Abdullah to maintain authority, he must take a far more radical stance against the US. Signs of Saudi intransigence have grown accordingly. Prince Abdullah stated that the US and Saudi Arabia should recognise and pursue their separate interests, and stepped up criticism of US policy on Palestine and Iraq.  Iran's internal stability is also in doubt. Iran tops the US list of state sponsors of terrorism, through its continued support of Hamas and Hezbollah. President Mohammad Khatami would like to move his country towards the west; privately, his advisers hint that he is prepared to make significant concessions on the terrorism issue. But despite an overwhelming electoral victory for the reformers last June, authority remains in the hands of the Khamenei-led conservatives, who soften their stance at their peril. The political situation in Iran - where soccer riots have led to widespread anti-government demonstrations - leaves little room for compromise.  Demographics work against both regimes. Rapidly expanding and extremely young populations have led to high unemployment and drastically diminished per capita income. Oil prices in the teens could not come at a worse time, guaranteeing crippling budget deficits and cutbacks on stretched social services. Together with pressure from the west, the position of both regimes is increasingly untenable.  Saddam Hussein, Iraq's president, has little concern for domestic instability. But reports of Iraqi intelligence connections to the September 11 terrorists, coupled with Mr Saddam's alleged development of biological and chemical weapons, make it hard for the US to avoid escalation. President George W. Bush does not yet subscribe to the view of many in the defence department that Iraq should be the US's next military target, but pressure to remove Mr Hussein from power will undoubtedly increase.  Further stirring the pot, the propaganda war is being lost by the US and the UK. Few in the Middle East feel any sympathy for Mr bin Laden, but the war in Afghanistan remains unpopular. Many are incensed by harm to Iraqi civilians over the issue of sanctions and by US support for Israel. As the war against terrorism moves closer to them, these feelings will intensify, further destabilising isolated regimes.  The danger is not that Saudi Arabia or their neighbours will stop selling oil to the west on principle: their need for petrodollars is overwhelming. The risk is that one or more key oil producers will face a sudden crisis of government, disrupting the flow of oil. And there are other dangers, such as a terrorist attack on key refineries or pipelines.  Nevertheless, few economists are seriously discussing the possibility of a jump in oil prices. They remain focused on prospects for recovery in the middle of next year. Significantly higher prices are far from certain, but $40 a barrel for any sustained period would damage or stall any recovery.  Washington can do little to help. Using its strategic oil reserves is a possibility, as is exploiting new reserves in Alaska. Strategic discussions with Russia to keep supply high and increased flows from the Caspian would also help.  Either way, a recovery is dependent upon maintaining stability in the Middle East. US fixes are simply nibbling around the edges.  Ian Bremmer is president of Eurasia Group and senior fellow at the World Policy Institute.  (c) Copyright Financial Times Ltd.

Terror threat puts oil firms on alert-- Letter warns of attacks on installations, pipelines if bin Laden killed or captured PETER KENNEDY  11/26/2001  The Globe and Mail  Metro  Page A4  \"All material Copyright (c) Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc. and its licensors. All rights reserved.\"  VANCOUVER -- Canada's oil-and-gas sector is on high alert after learning of a threat that associates of Osama bin Laden may be planning to sabotage energy installations and pipelines in North America.  A spokesman for B.C. Gas Utility Ltd. confirmed yesterday that the company has received a copy of a warning it believes was distributed to about 400 members of the Washington, D.C.-based American Petroleum Institute last week.  In a confidential letter, the institute said it had received information from a source of \"unde- termined reliability\" warning that an attack will take place if Mr. bin Laden or Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar is either captured are killed.  The letter contained no details on who issued the warning, how such an attack would be carried out, or which facilities would be targeted.  B.C. Gas spokesman Dean Pelkey said the warning may be the work of a prankster. \"But at the same time, when something like this comes out, you can't dismiss it out of hand,\" he said.  \"Since Sept. 11, we have increased security at our facilities and we are being more vigilant in watching and monitoring our pipelines. I think other oil-and-gas companies are likely doing the same,\" he said.  Mr. Pelkey said he believes the confidential warning was sent to other Canadian members of API, which, according to its Web site, include Alberta companies Petro-Canada and Syncrude Canada Ltd.  Contacted yesterday, officials at Petro-Canada and Syncrude Canada said they were not aware of the warning. They said their security measures have been stepped up since the Sept. 11 attacks.  Syncrude Canada spokeswoman Cherry Holland said the oil sands company's 3,700 employees have been told to wear personal identification tags at all times.  A Petro-Canada official said the company has installed fencing and surveillance cameras around its Edmonton refinery. Company employees also need security cards to get in and out of Petro-Canada's office buildings.  \"We are cognizant of the events of Sept. 11, as terrible as they were, and it is certainly accurate to say that we are being very conscious of security measures lately,\" Petro-Canada spokesman Chris Dawson said.  News of the warning comes just weeks after oil-patch representatives met with Alberta government officials to talk about security.  At the meetings Sept. 28, Alberta Premier Ralph Klein said the government needs to see an inventory of what oil-and-gas sector projects around the province need increased security. He said government and industry need to co- ordinate their efforts.  A spokesman for the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers declined to discuss the API warning.  \"On matters like this we make absolutely no comment other than that all information we received is passed on to federal and provincial authorities,\" he said.  About 40 per cent of U.S. oil-supply needs are met by Canadian producers, according to API's Web site.     Dynegy Board Silent On Status Of Enron Takeover  By Christina Cheddar  11/26/2001  Dow Jones News Service  (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- As the market continues to speculate about the status of Dynegy Inc.'s (DYN) takeover of Enron Corp. (ENE), Dynegy's board isn't offering its opinion.  \"Any comments coming out of Dynegy are coming from the company's executives,\" said Jerry Johnson, a Dynegy board member who also is an executive vice president at Safeguard Scientifics Inc. (SFE).  Johnson declined to comment on any matters related the pending acquisition of its larger rival, and wouldn't say whether the board has been meeting to discuss the transaction.  Three other board members, through their representatives, declined to comment as well. Other non-executive directors on the 14-member board either weren't immediately available to comment or couldn't be reached.  As for Dynegy's management, spokesman John Sousa said the company's opinion on the deal remains the same since its last comments on Wednesday.  At that time, Dynegy Chairman and Chief Executive Chuck Watson said Dynegy was continuing its due diligence and was looking to accelerate regulatory approval of the deal.  According to Sousa, Dynegy worked through the holiday weekend gathering information as part of its due diligence efforts.  Meanwhile, Enron continued its discussions to raise between $500 million to $1 billion of additional financing, said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne. The company also is working to restructure its debt by mid-December, she said.  But investors appear to be voting with their feet. Enron shares were recently down 18.3%, or 86 cents, to $3.85, while Dynegy shares slipped 2.7%, or $1.06, to $39.34. As a result, the already huge discount to the deal's offer price has grown even bigger as the market continues to signal the deal won't get completed on its original terms.  Under the terms of the transaction, Enron shareholders are to receive 0.2685 of a Dynegy share for each share outstanding, or about $8.98 billion, based on Dynegy's recent stock price.  At Enron's recent level, the stock is trading at a 64% discount to the Dynegy offer.  Neither Sousa or Denne would comment on the stock movement.  Dynegy has already provided Enron with a $1.5 billion cash infusion that is secured by Enron's pipeline assets. While that investment has helped Enron's near-term liquidity position, it remains unclear how long the company can remain solvent without any added investments.  -By Christina Cheddar, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5166; christina.cheddar@dowjones.com     Enron, Banks Formalize $690M Debt Extension To Dec. 14 By Carol S. Remond and Christina Cheddar  11/26/2001  Dow Jones News Service  (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  Of Dow Jones Newswires      NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) and a group of banks last week formalized an agreement to extend the due date on a $690 million syndicated loan by three weeks to Dec. 14.  The loan relates to one of Enron's consolidated limited partnerships that owns minority interests in power and energy projects around the world. Enron said last week that Standard & Poor's downgrade of its credit rating to \"BBB-\" had triggered an obligation to repay the loan by Nov. 27.  People familiar with the matter said last week that lead banks J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. and Enron will use the extension to negotiate a further postponement of the debt to the middle of 2002 when other Enron bank loans come due. About $1.75 billion of Enron's $3.5 billion in syndicated bank loans come due in May 2002 and will likely need to be restructured.  About $250 million of the assets securing the $690 million loan are in the process of being sold and will be used to pay down the loan, reducing the outstanding portion of the loan that will need to be restructured, those people familiar with the matter said.  Enron's shares and bonds continue to suffer from mounting uncertainties about the company's finances and whether those could force one-time rival Dynegy Inc. (DYN) to reconsider its offer to buy Enron, an offer that many see as Enron's only chance to avoid bankruptcy. Enron stock was recently down 18% to $3.84. Meanwhile, Enron bonds are also lower, with the 6.4% bonds due 2004 recently trading at a distressed level of 48 cents on the dollar.  Carol S. Remond; 201-938-2074; Dow Jones Newswires; carol.remond@dowjones.com  and Christina Cheddar; Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5166     Another Sign Investors Don't Trust Enron By Michael Rapoport  11/26/2001  Dow Jones News Service  (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  A Dow Jones Newswires Column     NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- If you needed any further proof that investors no longer trust Enron Corp. (ENE), here's another piece of evidence - one that goes to the heart of the recent plunge in the company's stock.  Enron doesn't simply trade for less than its book value; it fell below that milestone weeks ago. No, now it trades for less than ONE-THIRD of its book value.  That's a rare level for a company of Enron's size and prominence. And it may mean, among other things, that investors have decided that they simply can't place any further faith in the veracity of Enron's earnings and balance-sheet figures, much-revised as they've been - something that has unnerving implications for any attempt to value the company fairly.  First, let's be clear about what this means. Enron stock is currently about $4 a share; the company's reported book value is about $12.90 a share. In other words, Enron stock sells for less than one-third of what shareholders would get if the company were to liquidate - were to turn all its assets into cash, pay off all its liabilities on its balance sheet and give what's left over to shareholders.  This is an uncommonly dismal level for any company, even a troubled one. For comparison's sake, Dynegy Inc. (DYN), which has agreed to buy Enron, trades at about three times book value, as does El Paso Corp. (EPG), a competitor of both companies. In fact, Enron has the second-lowest price-to-book ratio of any company in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index - only Conseco Inc. (CNC), another troubled company, is lower, by an eyelash.  Part of the problem is undoubtedly the continuing fear among investors that Dynegy's agreement to buy Enron will fall apart, and the belief that Enron will have to file for bankruptcy if it does, in which case Enron shareholders would be hard-pressed to realize any value. The Dynegy deal now amounts to about $10.60 per Enron share, itself well under Enron's book value; the huge premium that level offers over Enron's current stock price is an indication of the big risk investors see that the deal won't be consummated in its current form.  But given Enron's current woes, it's certainly also possible that Enron is trading at such a big discount to book value because investors don't feel they can trust the earnings and balance-sheet numbers coming out of Enron. Those numbers, after all, are the raw material that form the basis for valuing Enron, or any other company, by computing figures like price-to-book and price-to-earnings ratios.  And the Enron debacle has been all about the quality of those numbers, with Enron shifting assets off its balance sheet to outside limited partnerships from which some of its executives benefitted. In terms of those numbers, the ground has shifted underneath investors three separate times now - when the company slashed its reported shareholder equity by $1.2 billion to unwind its transactions with one of those partnerships, when it restated nearly five years' worth of earnings downward by a total of $586 million, and when it revealed that it could take further charges and was facing an imminent deadline to post collateral on a $690 million note. (That deadline has now been extended until Dec. 14.)  When you've gotten punched in the face three times, it's not unreasonable to fear there'll be a fourth blow, no matter how much the puncher assures you there won't be. Given Enron's insanely complicated structure, and the way bad financial news has dribbled out of the company over the past several weeks, who can guarantee there aren't more such shocks yet to come?  That's what investors appear to be fearing, and that may be part of the reason Enron stock has fallen so precipitously. Thanks to Enron's repeated demonstrations that its numbers can't be relied on, investors no longer have a firm, trustworthy basis on which to value the stock. And so, not surprisingly, the value is getting ratcheted down to the most conservative, bare-minimum level.  An Enron spokesman couldn't be reached for comment.  It's ironic, in a way. For a long time, it was hard to properly value Enron because its structure and finances were so complex and hard to decipher. Now it's hard to properly value Enron because the company's attempts to clarify its finances have made it clear that it's hard to expect investors to trust in their accuracy.  -By Michael Rapoport, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5976; michael.rapoport@dowjones.com     Nov. 26, 2001, 11:19AM Oil, gas industry on high alert after FBI warning  Associated Press  WASHINGTON -- The oil and gas industry is on especially high alert after a Federal Bureau of Investigation warning that Osama bin Laden may have ordered retaliatory strikes against North American natural gas facilities in event of his capture or death, industry sources said today.  The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the warning issued by the FBI last week was general and singled out no specific target, but referred specifically to natural gas infrastructure such as pipelines.  There are thousands of miles of gas pipeline, most of them buried, crossing the United States and Canada. Thirty interstate gas pipelines carry 90 percent of the natural gas transported, according to the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America.  One source characterized the warning as similar to one issued earlier this month on potential attacks against West Coast bridges that prompted security alerts, but no evidence of actual terrorist intentions.  The FBI alert prompted the American Petroleum Institute, which is the lead industry group coordinating with the FBI and Energy Department on security matters, to issue a warning to oil and gas companies.  \"We have received uncorroborated information that Osama bin Laden may have approved plans to attack natural gas supplies in the United States,\" said the memo, adding that the information was \"from a source of undetermined reliability.\"  The FBI warning continued that \"such an attack would allegedly take place in the event that either bin Laden or Taliban leader Mullah Omar are either captured or killed.\"  Energy companies have stepped up security at refineries, pipeline pumping stations and other facilities since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington and the U.S. retaliatory attacks in Afghanistan.  Also, some detailed information about location of pipelines and other energy infrastructure have been taken off some corporate and government Internet sites. Access to facilities has been tightened as well, officials said. ",

Mapes Seattle Times staff reporter  Washington's first new coal-fired power plant in 30 years is being planned for Cherry Point in Whatcom County.  The plant is proposed to generate 249 megawatts of power and could be up and running within 36 months, said John O'Brien of U.S. Electric Power of Point Lookout, N.Y.  The plant's size falls just below the requirement for review by the state Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council. The facility must still meet all requirements of the federal Clean Air Act as well as state air-pollution controls.  Coal is considered the dirtiest of major fuels for power generation, emitting more carbon dioxide and gases that lead to smog than natural gas.  But coal plants vary widely in the amount of emissions they produce, depending on the quality of the coal, the technology used to burn it and the environmental standards.  O'Brien said the plant will burn only ultralow-sulfur coal and use stack scrubbers and other technology to make the coal plant at least as clean as a natural-gas-fired plant.  \"We are going to employ the best technology, and we will spend the money to make sure it happens. If there is anything dirty about it, we will not build it.\"  The company is also examining ways to partially offset carbon-dioxide emissions - the major cause of global warming - through reforestation of land in northwestern Washington, O'Brien said.  \"On CO2, we will do our best, and we will do better than anyone else, and more than any of the gas-fired folks,\" he said.  O'Brien says he knows the plant will be controversial despite his planned \"Green Coal\" public-relations campaign beginning May 1.  http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/SeattleTimes.woa/wa/got oArticle?zsection_id=268466359&text_only=0&slug=coal23m&document_id=1342765 28  Gregory Rehmke Foundation for Economic Education (914) 591-7230 x213; Cell: (914) 760-5638 www.freespeaker.org  ",

		"_body" : "NGI's Daily Gas Price Index  published : October 29, 2001 ALJ Clears Transwestern of Market Power Charges  A FERC administrative law judge has found no improprieties, nor evidence of the exercise of market power in negotiated rate contracts between Transwestern Pipeline and two shippers on its system, which resulted in the shippers being charged as much as $27/MMBtu last February, far in excess of the pipeline's allowed transportation rate of 38 cents/MMBtu (RP97-288-009).  ALJ Jacob Leventhal had only one fault to find, and that was with Transwestern's method of posting capacity. The judge said, and Transwestern agreed, to modify its tariff \"so that all posting, bidding and award procedures are set forth in a separate provision with an appropriate caption\" on its Internet bulletin board. Shippers had said that reviewing capacity on the Transwestern web site was \"a tortuous process.\"  Indicated Shippers claimed Transwestern's inadequate capacity posting and award procedures did not provide all interested parties with an opportunity to bid for the capacity that was available.  While \"both Indicated Shippers and (FERC) Staff find it curious that SET (Sempra Energy Trading) and Richardson (Products Co.) were the sole bidders on the contracts awarded to each of them...curiosity does not translate into proof,\" the judge said. Witnesses in the expedited hearing testified no bids were considered in advance of the capacity posting (see Daily GPI, Aug. 30). The judge subsequently found the capacity was awarded in a manner consistent with Transwestern's tariff.  Similarly, Levanthal could find no evidence that Transwestern exercised market power in negotiating the rates with shippers or withholding or threatening to withhold capacity. The capacity was available at recourse rates, and the shippers knew those rates were available. \"Staff's arguments really are criticisms of the posting and award procedures, but do not demonstrate the exercise of market power.\"  The two shippers said they made a business decision to propose the \"index-to-index\" formula that produced the higher rates, rather than take the recourse rate \"to minimize any risk on transportation options.\" The index-to-index formula refers to taking the difference between the daily published commodity prices at two different points and subtracting to get the transportation rate between them. In this case the two points were the San Juan Basin and the SoCal Needles delivery point.  The case was set for expedited hearing last summer by the commissioners acting on staff recommendations (see Daily GPI, July 26). ",

		"_body" : "EOL users can run eports and see all the details of transactions.  As  currently structured this would mean that any EOL user, including ENA, would  be able to run a report to see detail behind bids on pipeline capacity.   Obviously this would be a problem under the marketing affiliate rules.  At  their last meeting Dale and Shelley outlined three possible ways to address  this:  Add security such that ENA/EES users cannot run reports on pipeline bid  data.  I understood leaving the meeting that this might be technically  difficult or expensive. Exclude pipeline data from the reporting feature altogether.  Here the story  was that while this was not necessarily difficult, EOL could not make any  changes before version 2 was ready.  The impression was that this would be  possible after version 2. Erect procedural firewalls.  Mark Taylor suggested that perhaps we could  inform all ENA and EES personnel that the company has a policy that prevents  them from running reports on GPG data.  This probably isn't a good long-run  solution, but we all agreed that it might serve as a bridge measure.  This  approach is supported by the fact that Enron Networks has already entered  into a confidentiality agreement with GPG.  Solutions 1 and 2 require extensive technical work and unfortunately we  cannot currently spare the technical resources required for it. We can go  with solution 3 at present with the understanding that in the absence of a  large volume of trades it might be the permanent solution. This is something  that legal on both sides would have to agree to. Steve will check with their  legal department to see if this is acceptable. Dale can you please check with  Mark Taylor.  Further the credit departments on both sides should meet and iron out the  credit issues. Steve is going to make sure the two credit departments talk to  each other.  Thanks.  Savita      ",

Prior to this date, they faxed it to TW and the reps. would load that volume into the capacity system for the Socal point. Linda Ward thinks that we have the old fax documents saved in the file room.  Mary and I also called the EDI Hub team to find out how far back they store our EDI files. Currently the EDI Hub keep six months of data then the archive it. We could get to that date if needed. They would be a charge involved to pull archived data.  Wayne on the TMS team will also check to see if this information is replicated to adhoc (meaning we keep a complete history), or if it is not replicated (meaning we only keeps six months of data).

		"_body" : " Randy,  Yesterday, Sunday the 24th, one of the Gas Control Dispatchers was stuck in an elevator for approximately 5 hours. Apparently the alarm and the intercom were not functioning and she had no way of notifying anyone that she was stuck between the 39th floor and the plaza. After other dispatchers became concerned about her being missing and searched for her, it was 2 hours before they determined she was stuck in an elevator. It then took another 3 hours to repair the elevator and get her out. We were advised by one of the guards that the weekly test and inspection of the intercoms was not performed on Saturday, as scheduled. We also were led to believe that the level of maintenance and monitoring of the elevators has recently changed.   As you know, the Gas Control Center on EB42 is a 7X24 operation. It goes without saying that this type of situation is unacceptable and that a post-mortem of the event is required to correct any maintenance or operating deficiencies that may exist. Please research the event and let us know the root cause of the elevator failure, the intercom failure, and any changes in maintenance and monitoring that may have contributed.

		"_body" : "Due to the additional activity within ETS and the holidays, we will not hold a GISB Update meeting during the remainder of this year.  Hopefully we'll get back on a schedule after the first of the year.  Below is my update on a few GISB matters.  We'll go into more detail at our next meeting.  ENERGY INDUSTRY STANDARDS BOARD (EISB) The GISB Board of Directors has approved revisions to GISB's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws to incorporate language necessary to transition to the new organization, which will address standards for wholesale and retail gas and electric transactions.  The new organization, which goes into effect January 1, 2002, will be named the North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB).  The wholesale gas quadrant, which is now GISB, should continue with business as usual.  In January, I'll give a more detailed update on the workings of NAESB.  GISB REPRESENTATON Stan Horton's term on the GISB Board of Directors expires December 31, 2001.  Shelley Corman will take his place on the Board.  Her term expires December 31, 2003. My term as a representative on GISB's Executive Committee expires December 31, 2003.  ORDER 637 TRANSACTIONAL REPORTING The development of the new transactional reporting datasets for use on EBBs is almost complete.  The EBB implementation should be included in the next publication, which is scheduled for July 31, 2002.  This is probably a firm date.  The EDI implementation is now a lower priority, but will still be developed.  GISB VERSION 1.5 STANDARDS AND ERRATA Two separate errata have been developed for the version 1.5 standards.  The errors in the standards books are extensive.  The errata are posted alongside the books on the GISB homepage and have been distributed internally to all who received standards books.  I am working to have GISB correct the standards books.  Some people want to hold off and incorporate the corrections into the next version.  Our implementation will be much smoother if we don't have to continually refer to the errata along with the standards books.  I'll let you know what is decided.   Thanks, Theresa",

This would include the BCP Directors and Coordinators,  ETS Business and IT Team Leads, Mgrs, Dirs, VPs, and key staff, and ENW Contacts. The second card is for the OCC.  The third card is for the remainder of the ETS BCP Team members, both Business and IT staff.   Jean is touching up the OCC ETS BCP defined call burst groups and messages to match this process. Bob and I will be completing the Hangar Offsite layout, setup process, teams, and other documentation on Monday. We will get the documentation mounted and stored at the Hangar for use during an activation. We will also get the equipment stored  at the Hangar.   There is a meeting planned for Tuesday, at which we should be able to finalize the initial process, and schedule the first test.   Get us your comments on the attachments. We tried to keep it short and simple, but with enough detail to avoid  confusion during such an event.   Thanks, Gary   ",

		"_body" : " Here are some samples of the articles I mentioned during our phone call   Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.      Enron's Bonds Tell the Tale: Stay Away By Herb Greenberg <<mailto:hgreenberg@thestreet.com>> Senior Columnist RealMoney.com 10/24/2001 03:40 PM EDT URL: <<http://www.thestreet.com/p/rmoney/herbonthestreet-rm/10002953.html>>  Updated from 2:47 p.m. EDT  If you ever have questions about whether a battered stock is cheap, check out its bonds. Bond analysts almost always know best because they're looking at the guts of a company -- the ability of a company to service its debt. If it can't service the debt, stockholders are at a greater risk of getting pummeled because debtholders always come before stockholders when it comes to getting paid.  Which brings us to Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) . The only reason to mention it is that some analysts are really reiterating buys based on its low multiple. (Low, fellas, is relative to reality!) Cramer today talks about his hunch that the stock is vulnerable because, as he says, \"accounting irregularities = sell.\"  Good point. Now let's back that up with the bond market's view, which can be seen in the so-called \"swap spread,\" which is bond-traderspeak for the spread between the LIBOR interest rate and the interest rate for comparable paper, or swaps. It's a benchmark bond traders use to determine risk. Tuesday, that spread on Enron's five-year notes was 650 basis points, or about 6.5 percentage points. Today, it's 1,000 points, or 10 percentage points. As one bond trader told me today, anybody would be crazy to pay that much. Another bond trader told another friend the same thing.  Why? As of June 30, Enron had cash of just $847 million and debt of nearly $13 billion.  And this observation: Those five-year notes currently yield more than 11%. That's a junk-bond yield for what is still rated as an investment-grade debt; anything more than 9% is considered ultra-high risk. So while you can make 11%, that's still not enough \"where the accounting is questionable,\" one bond trader says. \"You're not being adequately compensated for the fact that the company could default. You have to worry about your recovery value.\"  Not the kind of risk/reward an investor wants to see when the company in question still has a market cap of about $12.5 billion with a capital B.  Speaking of bonds and stocks: Even with its stock at about $1.16, Global Crossing (GX:NYSE - news - commentary) still has a market cap that exceeds $1 billion. But while its stock has rallied, its bank debt has stayed relatively flat at around 50 cents to 53 cents on the dollar. Similar stories can be told for XO Communications (XOXO:Nasdaq - news - commentary) , with a market cap of about $473 million and bank debt trading at around 52 cents on the dollar; Level 3 Communications (LVLT:Nasdaq - news - commentary) , with a market cap of $1.2 billion and bank debt trading at 66 cents; and McLeodUSA (MCLD:Nasdaq - news - commentary) , with a market cap of $462 million and debt that trades at 53 cents.  Where are opportunistic bond investors, who should be hopping on such cheap debt -- especially bank debt, which is at the top of the getting-paid-back food chain? They're nowhere to be seen, for the same reasons they're not jumping to buy Enron's bonds: Too much risk, because when companies like those go bad, their assets trade for less than the bonds are currently trading. (Try telling that to \"hope-springs-eternal\" stock investors!)  Providian pratfalls: Turns out an item here back in May was more fortuitous than it appeared. The item noted how institutional bond investors, who often pony up a slight premium to LIBOR to buy so-called credit default-protection insurance, couldn't find any at any price for Providian (PVN:NYSE - news - commentary) . The insurance is sold by investment banks such as J.P. Morgan Chase and typically involves a complex hedge of stocks and options that requires an investor to take the other side of the trade. If nobody'll take the other side of the trade -- or will charge a ridiculously high price to do so -- investors should beware. Which brings us back to Enron: It is possible to buy credit insurance, but at more than a whopping 1,000 basis points over LIBOR. Hardly a vote of confidence.    Waiting for the Other Shoe to Drop on Enron By James J.

Those three words and an equals sign have always served me well. They remain squarely posted on the base of my quote machine, always in view. They have never let me down. When I have deviated from them I have had to pay severely, as I did when I ignored the accounting irregularities in Cendant (CD:NYSE - news - commentary) initially or when, because of my four-month holding period, I couldn't sell Qwest (Q:NYSE - news - commentary) .  Which is why I came in with guns blazing on this Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) , telling you to sell it. The stock has now lost half its value and all I can say is, I still can't see why you have to tempt fate and own this one. The notion that the businesses are fundamentally sound, that it has a great core business, is just hokum. Who the heck knows? Who has any idea of what this company can really earn? Who knows what it did earn?  All I know is that soon the drumbeat will be on from the Democrats that the Justice Department is playing political favorites by not pursuing Enron (noted Republican-giving company) for alleged fraud.  When that happens, when that shoe drops, wherever Enron is, then maybe it is worth some scrutiny.  But I bet I still won't like it.    Enron's Excuses Sound Familiar By James J. Cramer <<mailto:jjcletters@thestreet.com>>  RealMoney.com 10/23/2001 01:43 PM EDT URL: <<http://www.thestreet.com/p/rmoney/jamesjcramer/10002874.html>> If you disclose something that is wrong, and you get accountants to check off that wrong deed, and outside lawyers to check off on that wrong deed, is it therefore right?  That's what Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) is asking us to believe. By telling us that its ridiculous dealings with the chief financial officer and his private partnership were all sanctioned by outside professionals, they have simply compounded the error. Next they will tell us that Janus, the largest shareholder, knew and wanted those partnerships to generate upside surprises!  What they are doing at Enron is, well, positively -- here we go -- '80s! In the '80s, you had all of these savings-and-loan jokers pleading that the outside accountants and lawyers checked off on massive chicanery. Somehow it was supposed to make the chicanery kosher.  Nope.  What it ended up doing was getting the lawyers and accountants in trouble. The government ended up going after them, too, for abetting the travesties.  Enron didn't use taxpayers' money, so it is arguably not as clear-cut. But the more we probe this Enron, the more we check it out, the more we know it really stinks and that Jeffrey Skilling didn't leave because the stock got hammered, or some other authentic Wall Street gibberish, but because of this nasty, unseemly situation.  We don't want an SEC probe here. We want a Justice Department probe. This isn't about unclear disclosure. This could end up being about fraud.  In the meantime, I wouldn't touch this stock with a 10-foot pole. This one's gonna get real nasty before it gets nice. If it ever does.   FOOL ON THE HILL  Enron's Disdain for Investors  The Motley Fool.com 10/24/01 While recent coverage of Enron centers on the CFO's past partnerships, a smaller -- and more obvious -- omission is what should really make individual investors turn the heat up on this company. Not only does it not release its cash flow statement during each quarter's conference call and press release, something we don't like but is prevalent, it also doesn't release its balance sheet. The company must think we're idiots. They're wrong.  By Tom Jacobs <<http://www.fool.com/About/staff/tomj.htm>> (TMF Tom9)  October 24, 2001  Enron's (NYSE: ENE) <<http://quote.fool.com/uberdata.asp?symbols=ENE>> troubles just don't stop. On Monday, the company announced <<http://www.enron.com/corp/pressroom/releases/2001/ene/70-LJMfinalltr.html>> that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had requested information on \"certain related party transactions <<http://www.fool.com/specials/2001/sp010802e.htm>>.\" That was a veiled reference to partnerships until recently organized and directed by Enron CFO Andrew Fastow. There has been a flurry -- a hailstorm -- of financial media attention to this. There are only three possibilities, and none is palatable: The company's board allowed this deal in order to -- using corporate speak -- \"incentivize\" the CFO, and it was not legal;  It was legal, but unethical; or  Enron has been less than forthcoming, perpetuating a pattern of disdain for investors and keeping them in the dark.  The accounting machinations involve mind-numbing terms and obfuscation, making a simple explanation of what is being alleged above my capacity to provide. The New York Times' Floyd Norris calls them \"some of the most opaque transactions with insiders ever seen.\" That leads me to one conclusion when I think about burying myself with the company's SEC filings, accounting texts, my high-speed Web connection, and some beer: that of Shakespeare's King Lear -- \"that way madness lies.\"  On the one hand, I know that pulling all this apart might teach me useful things about accounting, reading financial statements, and finding trouble. (To read what this is all about, check the \"Certain Transactions\" section of the company's latest proxy statement <<http://quote.fool.com/sec/sec.asp?date=03/27/2001&currTicker=ene&symbols=ene&guid=%7B5D0F1D1D%2D5DB7%2D4F4E%2D9BD9%2DFA154603F662%7D>>.) I fully intend to do that -- someday. For now, though, all I need to know about Enron as an investment is that the company has not made these issues transparent. What's worse, though, is that Enron has made it a habit to keep investors in the dark, and not only about the potentially troublesome CFO issue. The company goes out of its way to hide its true financials. That really cheeses me off. The quarterly call and press release parade Most companies hold quarterly conference calls and simultaneously spew press releases (for which the companies pay good money to Business Wire and PR Newswire for dissemination) that allegedly state their latest quarter's numbers and talk about the business. Sometimes, when they have cleaned off their glasses enough for visibility and run it by their lawyers, execs will even venture to speak about the business climate ahead. At least thanks to Regulation Fair Disclosure <<http://www.fool.com/Specials/2001/sp010418.htm>> -- \"Reg. FD\" -- analysts don't get a secret call with the \"real\" numbers at another time than the public. We like that. Perhaps in a world of pro forma numbers <<http://aol.fool.com/portfolios/rulemaker/2001/rulemaker010815.htm>> and EBITDA <<http://aol.fool.com/portfolios/rulemaker/2001/rulemaker010906.htm>> -- both of which Phil Weiss has skewered appropriately in past columns -- the calls and press releases could never be expected to be that substantive. That makes individual investors increasingly correct to greet such information with cries of \"bullfeathers!\" It only takes a few reviews of earnings press releases to make anyone a skeptic. The PR department carefully dresses them with spin, leaving the details for the fine print. Headline: \"Earnings up!\" (Revenues down 40%.) Headline: \"Revenues up!\" (Earnings down 40%.) The skullduggery of spin and pro forma mangles earnings to meaninglessness <<http://www.fool.com/news/foth/2001/foth010504.htm>>. At least the conference calls themselves allow you a sense of managers as people and potentially some information about the business, but the financials are not helpful. Why?  Hiding the cash flow statement Because almost every company gives up only part of the financial picture at call and press release time. If the income statement is increasingly unhelpful, at least the balance sheet tells you whether the company has increased or decreased cash, right? Well, not quite. You really need the cash flow statement -- the best measure of how the company's business actually performs. Even then, you may need to make further adjustments <<http://aol.fool.com/portfolios/rulemaker/2001/rulemaker010906.htm>>. Yet the overwhelming majority of companies do not provide the cash flow statement at the call and press release time.  Check the companies you own. If they don't release cash flow statements with their earnings -- or, at least, prior to SEC filings, you should write and otherwise hound investor relations to push management to do so. Encourage your fellow investors to do so too, and tell the company that The Motley Fool sent ya. They will maintain that the numbers aren't ready at earnings time. Tell them to wait until they are. The numbers are certainly ready in time for the SEC deadline, and wouldn't we be happy to wait a week or two for the complete picture? Or, hey, why not do two releases -- one when the earnings are ready and another for the cash flow?  If not releasing the cash flow statement were Enron's only sin, it wouldn't be that big a deal. It has plenty of company. But this pre-Halloween < <http://www.fool.com/specials/2001/sp011024.htm>> scary tale gets worse. Unfortunately for Enron investors, the company does the hide-the-cash-flow-statement gig one better. Hiding the balance sheet For at least the last three quarters that I checked, Enron hides the balance sheet until SEC filing time. That's right: Not just the cash flow statement, but the balance sheet too. All they release is the income statement -- though, in truth, it does provide pages of income statement information for its many businesses. But why fail to release the balance sheet? The only conclusion can be that management doesn't want to show its cash balances until it can slip them into SEC filings it thinks people won't bother to read. When questioners on a conference call earlier this year urged former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling to provide a balance sheet at earnings release, Skilling reportedly \"called the questioner a common vulgarity that surprised many listeners.\" Off his meds that day? Or a symptom of the company's attitude towards shareholders? Looks like the latter: Skilling's gone, but the practice hasn't changed.  It's about management We don't depend on management for the numbers during the quarterly public calls and releases. A publicly traded company's financials will appear a few weeks later through its SEC filings available through our Quotes & Data page <<http://quote.fool.com/>>. No investor should be buying -- or holding -- stock in companies if they don't read their filings carefully. It's hard enough to discern what's going on in a business without doing so, and even in those filings -- such as with options grants to management -- the real meat is buried in footnotes. Not reading 10-Qs and 10-Ks is like getting married without dating, or buying a car by paint color only. What Enron's failure to release this information says is that its management and corporate governance are sub-par. It says management is willing to hold these events, but it'll be darned if it'll present anything meaningful or make it easy for individual investors to find out anything other than management's spin. In Enron's case, its former CEO heaped abuse on someone who dared ask for a change. Does that make Enron's earnings releases circuses? Draw your own conclusion. Is management listening? Perhaps. It hastily pulled together a conference call yesterday. TMF community member emschulze took notes <<http://boards.fool.com/Message.asp?mid=15974151>>: \"On call, analyst asks why no balance sheet with recent earnings release given company's previous claim that it will work to offer investors greater transparency in measuring its performance... response was that balance sheet doesn't normally come together until the week after its earnings release and that it will be included in 10-Q to be filed by Nov. 14... CEO indicates that it will do a better job of improving timing of release of earnings and balance sheet in future, implying that investors won't have to wait all the way until 10-Q filing deadlines to see balance sheet.\" That's a good sign. But until the company makes an unambiguous commitment to provide the balance sheet at earnings time, Enron should be in the doghouse.  Good corporate governance means companies release all their quarterly financial statements and discuss them at the same time because today's income statements and pro forma numbers are borderline useless. If it means a delay or a second release to get the numbers together, what's the problem? Shareholders should demand no less. When a company trumpets an income statement, as Enron has, no one should be surprised when smoke appears. And perhaps much more. Tom Jacobs (TMF Tom9) would like to improve his own cash flow statement. At press time, he owned no shares of Enron.

Barr  10/24/2001 Capital Markets Report (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) Of DOWJONES NEWSWIRES   NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The bonds of embattled Enron Corp. (ENE) are trading on a dollar basis and not on a yield margin or spread to Treasurys - another sign of increasing investor skittishness about the once high flying energy trader. The bonds, which carry investment-grade ratings, \"started trading with a dollar price two days ago,\" said Gary Brown, managing director and head of corporate trading, Wachovia Securities, Charlotte, N.C.  Bonds are being offered at dollar prices in the high 80's to low 90's, say traders.  Investment grade bonds typically trade on a spread margin over comparable Treasury issues. \"Credit bonds,\" which have questions about their quality, are traded in dollar quotes, said one analyst.  Moody's Investors Service rates the company's senior unsecured debt Baa1, but recently placed the debt on review for downgrade. Both Standard & Poor's Corp. and Fitch rate the debt triple-B-plus.  But the company \"may be going into the double-B (non-investment grade) sector, \" said Harold Rivkin, principal of H. Rivkin & Co., a distressed debt brokerage firm, Princeton, N.J.  \"I am starting to get inquiry from investment grade holders about the market for Enron bonds,\" Rivkin said, noting that some high-grade portfolios can't have paper below investment-grade.  Houston-based Enron, the nation's biggest energy trader, recently announced a large third-quarter loss and an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into a partnership arrangement that involves the company's chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow.  Enron has approached Citicorp (C) about obtaining a possible $750 million loan, according to a source close to the bank. But the source indicated Tuesday that nothing has proceeded past the preliminary inquiry.  The company's stock, while once a favorite of the investment community, has taken a pounding. It traded early this year at more than $80 a share. Late Wednesday, it was at $15.70 a share.  And, in a reflection of current investor sentiment, for the second time this week analyst Carol Coale of Prudential Securities downgraded the company to a sell recommendation from a hold. Her concern is \"not because of the things we know but because of the things that we potentially don't know.\"   -By Michael C. Barr, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2008; michael.barr@dowjones.com  (David Feldheim contributed to this article.)    Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.    USA: Group to put corporate directors under microscope. By Kevin Drawbaugh  10/24/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. WASHINGTON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Directors of corporations will be graded according to their performance by a service expected to be launched soon by business research group The Corporate Library, the group's cofounder said on Wednesday.  In a move that could cause some sweaty palms in boardrooms across the country, long-time shareholder activist Nell Minow said directors will be awarded grades of A, B, C and lower, based on meeting attendance and other benchmarks. \"It's always been my dream to rate individual directors like bonds. Directors have not had the scrutiny they deserve,\" said Minow, who said the service will be called Board Analyst.  Planned as an added feature on an existing Web site, thecorporatelibrary.com, Board Analyst is still in testing stages but is expected to launch next year, she said.  Only directors of U.S. companies will initially be evaluated. Non-U.S. directors may be added later.  Minow and partner Robert Monks have written several books on corporate governance and shareholder rights. They formerly managed the Washington-based shareholder activist Lens Fund, which they sold last year to British fund management group Hermes.  Their latest venture may find a receptive audience on the institutional buy-side, said industry spokespersons.  \"There's been growing interest within our membership in board membership, in general, and individual directors, in particular. I definitely think there would be interest in more information on individual directors,\" said Ann Yerger, spokeswoman for the Council of Institutional Investors, which represents America's large pension funds.  The corporate governance movement since its beginnings in the 1970s has focused on making directors more accountable and responsible. Many companies have responded by requiring more outside directors and more meaningful stock ownership among directors. But examples of lax board oversight still abound.  One example would be Enron Corp. , whose stock has plunged in recent days since the company said the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating transactions involving certain outside partnerships and the company's chief financial officer, Minow said.  \"Where was the Enron board in all of this?\" she asked. \"Boards and outside consultants are supposed to vet ideas for partnerships like these. That apparently didn't happen here.\"  Taking the corporate governance argument a step further, Minow argued that effective board membership is more than a theoretical question. It should be an issue for investors to evaluate when they consider buying stock in a company.  \"This isn't just a corporate governance thing. This is part of investment analysis,\" she said.  Institutional investors routinely examine corporate management when analyzing stocks. Whether they will begin to examine directors, as well, remained an open question.  \"Nell and Bob Monks have been shareholder activists for a long time and have moved corporate governance in a positive direction,\" said Peter Gleason, vice president of research and development at the National Association of Corporate Directors, which represents more than 3,000 corporate directors.  Surveys by the association recently showed that corporate directors rank self-evaluation high on their list of concerns. \"More and more directors are saying this is something we should be doing,\" Gleason said.

(AP) -- Electricity wholesalers have   overcharged California more than $5 billion since May by manipulating the   energy market, according to a report prepared for power grid managers.   The Independent System Operator will file the findings with federal   regulators and ask for a refund, ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said.   The state auditor also said Thursday that the state's 1996 deregulation law   encouraged both buyers and sellers of electricity to ``manipulate wholesale   prices to their advantage'' by underestimating supply and demand.   The auditor's report lays out what it calls ``a complex combination'' of   deficiencies and misjudgments it says led to the state's power problems.   According to the ISO report, five in-state power suppliers and 16 importers   frequently offered electricity at prices higher than it cost them to produce   -- effectively withholding supplies -- or didn't bid at all when they were   able to generate power.   ISO Director of Market Analysis Anjali Sheffrin presented the findings at a   conference in Berkeley last week.   The companies have denied overcharging California and have said they expect   the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will determine their prices were   justified.   The commission has recently stepped up scrutiny of power companies' behavior   during California's power crisis, asking suppliers to justify $124 million in   sales during the first two months of the year or refund the money. Critics   claim thousands of additional questionable sales are not being challenged.   California has been spending about $45 million a day -- $4.2 billion since   January -- to purchase power for Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern   California Edison. Both utilities, the state's largest, have been cut off by   electricity wholesalers because their credit is almost worthless.   Edison and PG&E say they are nearly $14 billion in debt due to soaring   wholesale power costs. The state's deregulation law blocks them from   recovering the costs from customers.   State Controller Kathleen Connell said Wednesday that the state's   power-buying is gutting its budget surplus.   Since the state started making emergency power buys, the surplus has fallen   from $8.5 billion to about $3.2 billion, she said.   Connell ordered an audit of the power buys, saying Gov. Gray Davis is   withholding key financial information from her office and the Legislature.   She said she would refuse to transfer $5.6 billion into a ``rainy day fund''   she said was set up to impress Wall Street as the state prepares to issue $10   billion in revenue bonds to cover its power buys.   Transferring the money would leave the state general fund $2.4 billion in   debt, Connell said.   Sandy Harrison, spokesman for the state Department of Finance, and Keely   Bosler, of the Legislative Analyst's Office, said such transfers are routine   and required by law.   ``The law says she has to do it. The law does not give her the power to   demand that kind of audit information,'' Harrison said.   Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the administration has released the   financial information it can without jeopardizing negotiations for long-term   power contracts with wholesalers.   Also Wednesday, a federal judge ordered a major wholesaler, Reliant Energy   Services, to continue selling power to California despite its fear that it   will not be paid.   The ISO buys power from companies like Reliant on behalf of utilities in   attempts to fend off rolling blackouts like those that hit the state this   week and during two days in January.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------------------  Reliant To Appeal Fed Judge Ruling To Sell Pwr To Calif    03/22/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service  (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)    LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) said Thursday it will   immediately file with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco in   response to a federal judge's ruling late Wednesday that the company continue   selling power to California regardless of whether it is paid.   U.S. District Court Judge Frank Damrell granted California's Independent   System Operator, which makes last minute power purchases in the spot market,   a preliminary injunction against Reliant, saying Californians were at risk of   irreparable harm if Reliant stopped selling power to the state.  The ISO, manager of the state's electricity grid, said the judge's ruling   will allow the agency to keep the lights on in California.   Reliant, which is owed more than $300 million from the state's cash-strapped   utilities, supplies California with about 3,000 megawatts of electricity from   power plants it owns in the state.   Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley said the state Department of Water   Resources, the agency that buys California's bulk power needs on behalf of   PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric, Edison International (EIX) unit   Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas &   Electric, should back the ISO's last minute power purchases.   In a filing with the Securities and Commission, Reliant said it is owed $108   million by the DWR for last minute power purchases the ISO made during the   six weeks prior to the agreement Reliant made with the DWR.   Damrell dismissed Reliant's claim, saying he does not have the authority to   force the DWR to pay for that power.   \"We're going to immediately appeal Judge Damrell's order,\" Wheatley said.   \"Clearly the judge understands the implications of his order. We are required   to do business with creditworthy entities. Unfortuantely the judge did not   force the ISO to post a surety bond, which would allowed us to do business   with the ISO.\"   Gov. Gray Davis has said the state is not responsible for the last minute   power purchases the ISO makes, despite a law passed authorizing the DWR to   buy power on behalf of the utilities.   Wheatley added that the company will also seek relief on the issue at the   Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Damrell's ruling remains in effect   until the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rules on the matter.   Separately, Wheatley said a short-term power supply contract that Reliant   signed with the DWR expired Monday and the DWR has not renewed the contract.   A spokesman for the DWR would not comment on the issue.   -By Jason Leopold; Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;   jason.leopold@dowjones.com  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------  Federal judge orders major power wholesaler to sell to California    Updated: March 21, 2001 - 8:23 p.m.   A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction Wednesday ordering a major   electricity wholesaler to continue selling to California despite its fear   that it will not get paid.   U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. said Californians were at risk of   irreparable harm if Reliant Energy Services stopped selling power to the   Independent System Operator, which oversees the state's power grid. The ISO   buys last-minute power on behalf of utilities to fill gaps in supply to try   to fend off blackouts.   Damrell dismissed Reliant's attempt to force the state Department of Water   Resources to back the ISO's purchases for the state's two biggest utilities.   The state has been spending about $50 million a day on power for Pacific Gas   and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, both denied credit by   suppliers after amassing billions of dollars in debts.  The judge said he had no authority to force the DWR to pay for that power.   Gov. Gray Davis has said the state isn't responsible for purchasing the   costly last-minute power ISO buys for Edison and PG&E, despite a law   authorizing state power purchases on the utilities' behalf.   ISO attorney Charles Robinson said the ruling gives ISO operators \"a tool to   assist them in keeping the lights on in California.\"   \"Had the decision gone the other way, one could expect other generators to   simply ignore emergency orders,\" Robinson said.   Damrell's preliminary injunction will remain in effect until the Federal   Energy Regulatory Commission rules on the matter.   Damrell denied the ISO's request for preliminary injunctions against three   other wholesalers, Dynegy, AES and Williams, who agreed to continue selling   to the ISO pending the FERC ruling.   Spokesmen for Reliant, Dynegy, AES and Williams were out of the office   Wednesday night and didn't immediately return calls from The Associated Press   seeking comment on the ruling.   The ISO went to court in February after a federal emergency order requiring   the power sales expired. The judge then issued a temporary restraining order,   requiring the sales, but dropped it after the suppliers agreed to continue   sales to California, pending his Wednesday ruling.   The ISO said it would lose about 3,600 megawatts if the suppliers pulled out,   enough power for about 2.7 million households. One megawatt is enough for   roughly 750 homes.   Grid officials said Reliant's share alone is about 3,000 megawatts. Reliant   said the amount at issue actually is less than a fourth of that, because most   of the power is committed under long-term contracts.   Reliant, which provides about 9 percent of the state's power, worries it   won't get paid due to the financial troubles of PG&E and Edison.   PG&E and Edison say that together they have lost about $13 billion since June   due to soaring wholesale electricity costs that California's 1996   deregulation law bars them from passing onto customers.   At the same time, the state has faced a tight electricity supply, due in part   to California power plant shutdowns for maintenance and to a tight   hydroelectric supply in the Pacific Northwest.   Managers of the state power grid imposed rolling blackouts across the state   Monday and Tuesday as supply fell short of demand. Wednesday, cooling   temperatures and the completion of repairs at several power plants allowed   the state to avoid blackouts.  State Controller Kathleen Connell said Wednesday that the energy crunch also   imperils California's financial health.  Connell said the state's power-buying on behalf of Edison and PG&E is is   gutting its budget surplus. Since the state started making emergency power   buys in January, the surplus has fallen from $8.5 billion to about $3.2   billion, she said.   Connell ordered an audit of the state's power-buying, saying Davis is   withholding key financial information from her office and the Legislature.   She is refusing a request by Davis and the Legislature to transfer $5.6   billion into a \"rainy day fund\" she said was set up to impress Wall Street as   the state prepares to issue $10 billion in revenue bonds to cover its   power-buying.   Transferring the money would leave the state general fund $2.4 billion in   debt, Connell said.   Sandy Harrison, spokesman for the state Department of Finance, and Keely   Bosler of the Legislative Analyst's Office, said such transfers are routine   and required by law.   They put the state's budget surplus at $5.6 billion.   \"The law says she has to do it. The law does not give her the power to demand   that kind of audit information,\" Harrison said.   He said the state's budget isn't in danger because it will be repaid with the   $10 billion in long-term debt.   Wells Fargo & Co. chief economist Sung Won Sohn said he sees little progress   in efforts to fix the state's power problems and end state electricity   purchases.   \"If we're going to pour money into a bottomless pit, I would worry about the   state's finances,\" he said. \"At some point we're going to run out of money.\"  The controller's criticism of fellow Democrat Davis won support from Assembly   Republicans and Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican considering   challenging Davis next year.   Jones said he wants to announce his own plan to solve the state's energy   woes, but can't unless Davis releases more financial details.   Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio dismissed the criticism.  \"Political grandstanding doesn't generate one more kilowatt of energy for   California in this time of emergency,\" he said.   Maviglio said the administration has released the financial information it   can without jeopardizing negotiations for long-term power contracts with   wholesalers.   Also Wednesday, a report by Davis' chief power negotiator appears to show   that as much as 75 percent of the state's power purchases will have to be on   the expensive short-term market this summer, said Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina   del Rey, chairwoman of the Senate Energy Committee.   \"The prices may be phenomenol,\" she said, particularly given predicted   hydroelectric shortages due to drought in the Pacific Northwest.   The report by David Freeman, who is negotiating the state's long-term power   contracts, shows California has finalized 19 contracts and has 25 agreements   in principle. Freeman said DWR is continuing to negotiate other contracts.  Bowen said FERC should impose short-term price caps or let generators to   charge enough to make a reasonable profit \"or we could be subject to enormous   price-gouging this summer.\"     -- Associated Press  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------  State falling short on pacts that provide low-cost energy   Published Thursday, March 22, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News   BY CHRIS O'BRIEN AND JOHN WOOLFOLK     Mercury News     The state has signed low-cost contracts for just a third of the energy it   needs this year, raising the prospect that California could be forced to buy   much of its electricity this summer on the expensive spot market.   A spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis conceded Wednesday that the state will be in   trouble without more contracts, but insisted California will meet its needs   through conservation and additional long-term deals for cheap electricity.   The state, according to a report released Wednesday, has fallen far short of   the governor's goal of filling almost all its electricity needs through such   deals. In fact, the state has lined up contracts for about half the amount   Davis had projected earlier this month.   If the state has to rely heavily on the volatile spot market, where the price   of electricity this summer could reach five times the state's contract price,   pressure could mount to raise the cap on the electricity rates consumers pay.   But Steven Maviglio, the governor's spokesman, said, ``The governor has said   he's committed to work this in the existing rate structure, so that's the   plan.''   In the report sent to state lawmakers, the state Department of Water   Resources indicated that it had secured just more than 20 million   megawatt-hours for this year, leaving it far short of the 60 million   megawatt-hours needed.   ``This is just a progress report,'' Maviglio said. ``They did all this in   three weeks, which is pretty amazing when you think about it, and we have a   lot more to do.''   The state got into the power buying business in January, supplying it to the   state's nearly bankrupt utilities.   The state negotiated long-term contracts with generators to supply that power   at a reduced rate. Based on the report, the state will pay an average of $68   per megawatt-hour over the next 10 years -- significantly less than in   December when prices spiked higher than $300 per megawatt-hour but not as low   as the $55 Davis hoped to reach.   Most of this power, however, won't be delivered until 2004. From 2004 to   2006, the Department of Water Resources estimates, it has enough power under   contract. Until then, the amount falls short.   In 2001, it appears the state has about one-third of the power it needs. The   gap closes to about half in 2002 and two-thirds in 2003.   At a news conference in Los Angeles two weeks ago, Davis said the state would   have to buy only 30 to 45 percent of the power it needs this summer on the   open market.   At the time, critics said with only two-thirds of the power under contract, a   rate increase was almost inevitable. Even Davis' chief negotiator, S. David   Freeman, offered a bleak assessment for the summer, saying that all available   electricity has already been sold.   ``We'll be subject to extremely high prices,'' said Frank Wolak, a Stanford   professor who sits on a market committee for the Independent System Operator,   the agency that runs the state power grid.   Wolak said there are two main hopes for avoiding a price increase this   summer: Federal officials could cap the wholesale price, a step they've   resisted, or Californians can conserve an unprecedented amount of power.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------  Crisis saps state surplus  POWER CRISIS   Controller moves to block a transfer of funds, saying the $8.5 billion   surplus has been cut more than half since January   By Mike Taugher  TIMES STAFF WRITER   The energy crisis has bled California's once-touted budget surplus by more   than half since taxpayers began buying electricity two months ago, leading a   top state finance official Wednesday to order an audit of the power purchases   and block Gov. Gray Davis' plan to transfer funds into a reserve account.   A booming economy last year produced a budget surplus that totaled $8.5   billion in January. But that figure now stands at about $3.2 billion,   according to Controller Kathleen Connell.   \"We started this year with a generous budget surplus,\" Connell said in a   statement announcing her decision to block what Davis administration   officials described as a routine transfer of surplus money. \"The energy   crisis has taken much of that away, and this transfer on top of the   electricity purchases would put the fund at risk.\"   Meanwhile, the Davis administration released a report by David Freeman, the   governor's chief negotiator on power purchases, on the progress of executing   long-term agreements meant to stabilize the power buys.   According to the report, only about 40 percent of the electricity needed from   the open market this year has been lined up. That means the state could be   forced to continue buying a substantial amount of power on the highly   expensive spot market and further drain its coffers.   And a key regulatory panel is scheduled next week to issue a ruling that   would determine how quickly state funds will be replenished when it decides   what portion of electric bill payments should be allocated to the state   treasury, a decision that could include a rate increase to fully repay   taxpayers without further crippling the state's two largest electric   utilities.   The Public Utilities Commission also will consider whether it will force the   utilities to pay alternative energy producers, whose shutdowns this week   contributed to blackouts.   Connell's action underscores a growing nervousness over the sheer volume of   money that is being poured into energy buys, despite the fact that state   officials plan to replenish the treasury with up to $10 billion in loans that   will be repaid by electricity consumers.   The state has committed to spending $4.2 billion to date to keep lights on   since taxpayers were forced in mid-January to take over electricity buys from   the financially crippled utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern   California Edison. Tax money is going out at a clip of about $50 million a   day.   High prices already have brought PG&E and Edison to the brink of bankruptcy,   and now the state's surplus is at risk, according to Connell.   In addition to requesting an audit and announcing her intention to delay the   transfer to the reserve account, Connell said she wanted the administration   to send her office more information about the electricity purchases.   Davis' representatives questioned Connell's authority in trying to block the   funds transfer, which they called a routine accounting procedure, and accused   her of making political hay.   \"It is not helpful to the taxpayers or ratepayers or the people who just want   to keep the lights on, it isn't helpful to have the situation muddied like   this,\" said Sandy Harrison, a Finance Department spokesperson. \"We're sorry   it came up in this manner.\"   Connell and the administration have butted heads in recent weeks. The   controller wants to post details of the state's electricity purchases on her   Web site, a plan that have been delayed under pressure from Davis because of   the governor's concerns that releasing those details will allow power   generators and traders to sell at higher prices.   Harrison said administration officials believe Connell lacks the authority   either to block the funds transfer to a reserve account or to audit the state   water resources department.   Two days of widespread blackouts this week show how vulnerable the power grid   is to financial glitches. Although several factors combined to produce the   blackouts, state power officials say the outages could have been avoided if   the utilities were paying their bills to alternative energy producers.   Many of those producers, including clean-burning natural gas power plants,   wind, solar and geothermal energy developers, shut down enough production to   spell the difference between grid reliability and blackouts Monday and   Tuesday.   Davis called the utilities' failure to pay bills to those producers, known as   qualifying facilities, \"immoral.\" The QFs were either unable to buy gas from   their suppliers or were frustrated with the utilities' failure to pay them.   \"The utilities hoarded billions of dollars since November without paying any   money out,\" said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio. \"They've got the money --   we're pulling the trigger to make them pay it.\"   The utilities, however, say they are doing all they can to conserve enough   cash to continue operating. Together, they owe the QFs about $1.5 billion.   Next week, the PUC is scheduled to consider whether to force the utilities to   heed Davis' demand to pay the QFs, and it might also decide how much of   ratepayers' bill payments will be used to refund taxpayers for power buys.   PG&E says that under a formula proposed by the administration, the water   resources department would receive about 40 percent of the money collected   from ratepayers for power purchases.   The rest of that money, about $240 million, would have to be divided among   QFs, existing power contracts, operating PG&E's nuclear and hydroelectric   plants, and what hour-by-hour purchases the utility still must make on the   spot market, according to PG&E spokesman John Nelson.   \"There isn't enough to do that,\" he said.   That is making it increasingly likely that electric bills will be hiked,   according to a growing chorus of officials and experts.   Unless rates are raised, Nelson said, the only entity that can absorb a lack   of payment or a partial payment is the state treasury. Cutting off any others   will lead to electricity becoming unavailable and more blackouts, he said.   \"If they do it under existing rates -- given that the existing pool of money   is not enough -- who doesn't get paid or who gets a partial payment?\" Nelson   said. \"What's the only entity left with wiggle room? The state.\"   Rate hikes are also a sticking point in negotiations to bail out the   utilities through purchase of their transmission lines and other assets,   Maviglio said.   \"They want rate increases of significant magnitude, and we're not going   there,\" he said.   WE CAN TRIM STORY HERE IF NECESSARY, BUT KEEP TAGLINES AT BOTTOM   About one-third the electricity needed by the customers of California's three   major utility companies is produced by the companies themselves, one-third   comes from alternative producers who use environmentally friendly techniques   and one-third is bought on the open market.   The state stepped in to buy the one-third needed from the open market after   the utility companies ran out of cash and credit in January to make the   purchases themselves.   But that electricity has proven to be enormously expensive, and Davis has   planned to lower those prices by committing to long-term purchases.   Freeman's report on the progress of those long-term purchases, dated March 15   but released this week, said the state has finalized 19 contracts with seven   suppliers and reached 25 additional agreements.

The state Senate passed the bill, AB 8x, but with Republicans balking, it was   rejected in the Assembly along party lines. Assembly leaders said they may   try again today.   For most of Thursday, lawmakers scrutinized legislation they had overhauled   the night before to include Gov. Gray Davis' plan to force utilities to pay   solar, wind and small gas-fired suppliers. Such providers, called \"qualified   facilities,\" or QFs, provide more than 20 percent of California's   electricity, and their shutdowns were partly to blame for rolling blackouts   Monday and Tuesday.   Under the Democratic governor's plan, the state Public Utilities Commission   would determine prices at which alternative generators may sell power, but   legislation is needed to authorize the PUC action.   Lawmakers faced time pressures Thursday. They wanted to pass the bill quickly   so the PUC could act next week and legislators could embark Monday on an   annual three-day lobbying trip in Washington, D.C.   Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks, said the Republicans'   rejection of AB 8x could jeopardize more than $4 billion the state has spent   or allocated for electricity during the energy crisis.   Hertzberg said producers of alternative energy, which are owed more than $1   billion, have threatened to drag debt-ridden utilities into involuntary   bankruptcy if the Legislature failed to pass the measure.   \"They said it, and I believe it,\" Hertzberg said. If such bankruptcies occur,   he added, the state with its multibillion-dollar debt would become \"just   another creditor in a pile of creditors.\"   But Assembly Republican leader Bill Campbell of Villa Park said the   finger-pointing is unfair. Passage of AB 8x would not necessarily prevent   bankruptcies, he said.   One alternative energy provider won a crucial court ruling Thursday that   staved off, at least for a while, threats by some creditors to haul one or   both big utilities into bankruptcy court for nonpayment of bills.   CalEnergy Co. Inc. won the right to sell its geothermal power, which was   contracted to Southern California Edison, on the open market. CalEnergy said   it is owed $45 million by Edison.   If the Imperial County judge hadn't ruled in CalEnergy's favor, the company   and seven other QFs \"were fully prepared\" to file an involuntary bankruptcy   petition against Edison this morning, said David Sokol, chief executive of   CalEnergy's parent, MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co. of Des Moines, Iowa.   \"That is currently off the table.\"   An involuntary bankruptcy proceeding would take California's energy crisis   into uncharted territory, although a bankruptcy judge would have the leeway   to reject the filing.   Freed from its contract with Edison, CalEnergy will move to sell its   electricity \"to people who will pay for it,\" Sokol said.   Besides calming the bankruptcy movement temporarily, the ruling also could   prompt other alternative energy providers -- hundreds of which have shut down   because of nonpayment by Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. -- to follow   CalEnergy's example and find other buyers for their electricity, said Gary   Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, an association of generators.   Assembly Republicans said they felt the Senate's decision to package three   important energy issues into a single bill was an attempt to ramrod   legislation through both houses.   \"We have to stand and say no,\" Campbell said during floor debate.   Besides determining alternative generator payments, the bill would change an   earlier law by capping the value of bonds the state may sell for power   purchases at $10 billion. It also would extend to large businesses an   existing rate cap in the San Diego Gas and Electric Co. service area.   And it would earmark a portion of rates paid by utility customers to fund the   state's ongoing power purchases. Within a week, the state will have spent   $4.2 billion on power since January.   Without the bill, some legislators fear, Pacific Gas and Electric and   Southern California Edison would be reimbursed before the state.   \"They have got (some) gall to go to the PUC and say they're going to go to   court to keep our money -- to keep our money to pay off their creditors,\"   said Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco.   Most of the bill's controversy, however, centered on how the PUC would treat   gas-fired alternative generators.   The commission issued a revised draft decision Wednesday that would impose   prices for qualifying facilities at $79 a megawatt-hour for five-year   contracts or $69 a megawatt-hour for 10 years.   But those producers that use natural gas -- representing about two-thirds of   the alternative energy providers in California -- spent Thursday arguing that   Davis' plan to rescue them would all but guarantee that they would go out of   business instead.   The plan -- ordering Edison and PG&E to pay them a fixed price for their   power -- would set rates well below the cost of natural gas, they said.   Democratic lawmakers tried to assure such producers that the PUC would set   prices that make business sense, even obtaining a letter to that effect from   Loretta Lynch, who heads the commission.   Davis has vowed to fine Edison and PG&E if they don't pay alternative   producers for future deliveries. But Sokol said his company isn't convinced   that Edison will pay.   Calling Edison a \"confrontive, in-your-face, nasty organization,\" Sokol said   the utility was \"sitting on $2 billion\" and not paying its bills. Edison, in   a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Thursday, said its debts outweigh   its cash reserves by $722 million.   The Senate sent the Assembly two other bills that deal specifically with   supply and demand. The first, SB 5x, would spend about $1 billion on energy   conservation and low-income assistance programs. The other, SB 28x, would   streamline siting procedures for power plant construction.   In separate energy-related matters Thursday, the Assembly approved:   AB 21x, which would allow businesses, industries or other electrical   customers to negotiate private contracts with energy providers.   Nine energy bills designed to generate or save 665 megawatts of electricity   -- including 345 megawatts this summer. One megawatt is enough electricity to   light about 1,000 homes.   The state put power emergencies behind it, after dropping out of a Stage 1   alert late Wednesday. The California Independent System Operator, which   manages the state's power transmission grid, was predicting no further alerts   this week. It expected cooling temperatures and a regular dropoff in   electricity use on Fridays to lessen demand, at the same time that more power   plants were returning to service.

By David Whitney  Bee Washington Bureau  (Published March 23, 2001)   WASHINGTON -- A key House panel wrapped up a series of hearings on the   California electricity crisis Thursday and now will decide whether to come to   the state's aid with legislation.   But the panel's Texas chairman made clear that West Coast price controls   won't be on the table.   \"Caps will not be in anything I am submitting,\" said Rep. Joe Barton,   chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's energy and air quality   subcommittee.   Some form of federal controls to hold down escalating wholesale prices this   summer because of power shortages has been the most frequent appeal of   witnesses who testified before the panel during roughly 30 hours of hearings   over five days.   Such controls have been sought by the governors of California, Oregon and   Washington. As power shortages are forecast for other regions, states like   New York also have appealed for temporary price controls to halt gouging.   But the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which is responsible for   enforcing reasonable wholesale rates under the Federal Power Act, has refused   to impose them, and the Bush administration is bolstering that decision by   opposing any legislation that would compel such action.   Barton, in a brief hallway interview, declined to say what other legislative   remedies he might propose to address the worsening California situation.   He said he expects to submit a list of ideas to the White House today, and   after receiving comment on it, sit down with other committee Republicans and   Democrats next week to see if any legislation is in order.   \"If we are going to do anything to help California or the West this summer,   we have to make it law within the next month or six weeks,\" Barton said.   Even the panel's senior Democrat, Virginia Rep. Rick Boucher, was urging a   \"careful and deliberate approach\" to the California crisis, which he said was   largely of the state's own making.   There are steps Congress might take to provide some help to the West, such as   more money for conservation and relaxed federal regulation of air quality   standards. That would permit older, more polluting generators to operate   through a long, hot summer when electricity demand could exceed supply by   about 3,000 megawatts, roughly the amount needed to power 3 million homes.   But Alan Lloyd, chairman of the California Air Resources Board, said power   production already is being maximized without sacrificing air quality.   \"Simply put, no essential electricity generation has been curtailed due to   air emission limitations,\" he said. \"California's programs to protect public   health are not major factors in the electricity shortages experienced to   date.\"   The concern is that as shortages turn into more rolling blackouts, wholesale   prices will jump even higher and steadily bleed the economies of California   and the West Coast.   William L. Massey, the lone member of the energy regulatory commission who   supports price controls, said at a Tuesday hearing that without them the West   Coast faces economic catastrophe this summer.   It was evident from the comments of some Republicans that they think their   party could capitalize politically from a difficult summer.   \"If they had a bad summer, it could show up in the polls,\" said Rep. Charlie   Norwood, R-Ga. \"And sometimes that's not a bad idea.\"   One of the most dramatic exchanges during the weeklong hearings came Thursday   with S. David Freeman, the former general manager of the Sacramento Municipal   Utility District who now heads the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.   He recently was named Gov. Gray Davis' chief negotiator with power generators   for long-term contracts to stabilize future deliveries.   \"Don't feel sorry for California,\" Freeman said. \"We're going to come out of   this stronger than ever.\"   But Freeman said it will be a year or two before all the fixes are in place,   and in the meantime the region desperately needs Congress' help to force the   FERC into controlling wholesale prices, which witnesses said are likely to   rise from $7 billion last year to as much as $70 billion or more this year.   \"We recognize that the current administration and various legislators have   their own opinion as to the California situation,\" Freeman said. \"But my   personal plea is that if the federal government is not going to help us, the   least it should do is refrain from legislation that attempts to tell us what   to do.\"   Barton perked up at that idea.   \"Leave California alone, huh?\" Barton said. \"That might be a good motto.\"   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------  Dan Walters: Crisis deepens: politicos panic      (Published March 23, 2001)   That choking sound you hear is California's political class shifting into   near-panic mode as it realizes that the energy crisis is on the verge of   becoming a full-scale meltdown, with utilities forced into bankruptcy and   consumers hammered by severe and prolonged power blackouts and soaring   electricity bills.   The Legislature, which had been content to allow Gov. Gray Davis to handle   the crisis on his own, suddenly came to life Thursday, jolted by this week's   unexpected rolling blackouts and threats by creditors to force the utilities   into bankruptcy court. Lawmakers quickly fashioned a basketful of legislation   aimed -- or so they hope -- at increasing power supplies, promoting   conservation and relieving the financial pressure on utilities and   electricity generators. But it may be too little, too late -- and Davis and   other politicians are already pointing fingers of blame, aware that a   political price will be paid if the apocalypse strikes.   While Davis chants his mantra that he inherited a fatally flawed utility   deregulation scheme from predecessor Pete Wilson, Republicans are blaming   Davis for moving too slowly after the crisis first surfaced last summer, and   even some of Davis' fellow Democrats are distancing themselves from the   governor.   \"Deregulation was a product of a Republican governor, a Republican author and   a Republican PUC (Public Utilities Commission) that was unduly impatient,\"   Davis said at one point this week as the Capitol buzzed with private   negotiations and public posturing.   A day later, however, state Controller Kathleen Connell, a Democrat, issued a   warning that Davis' power purchases, running at $50 million a day, had   already drawn down state budget reserves by nearly two-thirds, and she   refused to authorize additional transfers. It was a direct shot by Connell at   Davis, an old rival, and came just a day after the governor had endorsed a   Connell foe, Antonio Villaraigosa, in the duel for mayor of Los Angeles.   Other Democrats didn't join Connell's direct challenge to Davis, but there   is, nevertheless, a growing concern among Democratic legislators that the   power purchases are costing many billions of dollars more than the governor   had projected and could place the state budget in jeopardy. They're nervous   because Davis has refused to reveal, even to legislators, exactly how much   power the state is buying each day and how much it is paying.   From the few details that have been disclosed, it's clear that the state is   spending about $1.5 billion a month, which would wipe out the state's   reserves by midsummer. It's also becoming increasingly clear that Davis   probably can't make good on his promise to avoid major consumer rate   increases, unless the state is willing to plunge deeply and semi-permanently   into debt to underwrite wholesale costs, or unless federal authorities order   huge refunds from power suppliers.   Rates in areas served by private utilities have risen only slightly while the   costs, first to utilities and later to the state, soared. Data from the   administration and utilities, when collated, indicate that the state is in   line to collect just 20 cents for every dollar it's spending on power   purchases, and the gap will increase as summer heat drives up demand.   Privately, some economists say that private utility rates will have to rise   33 percent to 50 percent to cover costs of current power supplies, plus   utilities' past debts to generators and the state's purchase of the   utilities' transmission system, if that deal is made final.   \"It's ultimately going to break down, and the ratepayer is going to pay for   it one way or the other,\" Republican Sen. Jim Battin said during one of   Thursday's many committee hearings on utility legislation. No one disagreed   with him.   DAN WALTERS' column appears daily, except Saturday. Mail: P.O.

The Independent System Operator planned to file the findings with federal   regulators Thursday, and ask for a refund, said ISO spokesman Patrick   Dorinson.   In a related development, the state auditor said Thursday that the state's   1996 deregulation law encouraged both buyers and sellers of electricity to   \"manipulate wholesale prices to their advantage\" by underestimating both   supply and demand.                   Disappearing state surplus sparks alarm   Outages darken economic outlook in state, some say   Out-of-state generators question power regulators' authority   Allegheny Energy makes big California connection   Enron stock slides despite earnings reassurance   California's electricity crisis at-a-glance   ?         The auditor's report lays out what it calls \"a complex combination\" of   deficiencies and misjudgments it says led to the state's power problems.   The ISO's filing came a day after the state controller complained that a   relentless energy crisis is jeopardizing California's financial future.   Since May, the companies manipulated the market by bidding at excessive   prices, effectively withholding supplies or by not bidding at all when they   had generation capability available, according to the ISO study.   ISO Director of Market Analysis Anjali Sheffrin presented the findings at an   energy conference at the University of California, Berkeley, last week.   The companies have denied overcharging California and have said they expect   the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will determine their prices were   justified.   In a burst of activity after weeks of delay, both houses of the Legislature   approved bills Thursday designed to ease the energy crisis.   The state Senate approved measures to encourage energy conservation and speed   up power plant construction.   Topping that, the Assembly sent the Senate 14 energy-related bills, including   $455 million in loans and grants to encourage energy efficiency and   conservation and alternative energy projects by this summer.   One of the Assembly bills would require new energy plants approved by the   state to sell their power within California before they offer it to other   states.   \"The (California) Energy Commission says for every day we delay this bill   there are 20 megawatts that could be saved that we're not saving,\" said state   Sen. Byron Sher, D-Stanford, as senators voted 28-10 to send his conservation   measure to the Assembly.   Senators also approved another Sher bill speeding up the siting of power   plants. It went to the Assembly on a 37-1 vote.   Meanwhile, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction Wednesday ordering   one of the companies named in the ISO filing, Reliant Energy Services, to   continue selling to California despite its fear that it will not be paid.   U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. said Californians were at risk of   irreparable harm if Reliant stopped selling power to the ISO, which buys at   the last minute on behalf of utilities to bolster supplies and try to fend   off blackouts.   Such blackouts struck the state twice this week, shutting off power to   hundreds of thousands of people from San Diego to Oregon, snarling traffic   and shutting down businesses.   The state remained free of any power alerts Thursday morning, as power   reserves stayed above 7 percent.   Damrell dismissed Reliant's attempt to force the state Department of Water   Resources to back the ISO's purchases for the state's two biggest utilities,   Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co.   The judge said he had no authority to force the DWR to pay for that power.   The utilities have been denied credit after amassing billions of dollars in   debt paying high prices for power that the state's energy deregulation law   prevents them from passing on to consumers.   Gov. Gray Davis has said the state isn't responsible for purchasing the   costly last-minute power the ISO buys for Edison and PG&E, despite a law   authorizing state power purchases on the utilities' behalf.   ISO attorney Charles Robinson said the ruling gives ISO operators \"a tool to   assist them in keeping the lights on in California.\"   \"Had the decision gone the other way, one could expect other generators to   simply ignore emergency orders,\" Robinson said.   Damrell's preliminary injunction will remain in effect until the Federal   Energy Regulatory Commission rules on the matter.   In another development Wednesday, state Controller Kathleen Connell   complained that the energy crunch is imperiling California's financial   health.   Connell said the state's power buying on behalf of Edison and PG&E is gutting   its budget surplus. Since the state started making emergency power buys in   January, the surplus has fallen from $8.5 billion to about $3.2 billion, she   said.   Connell ordered an audit of the state's power buying, saying Davis is   withholding key financial information from her office and the Legislature.   She is also refusing a request by Davis and the Legislature to transfer $5.6   billion into a \"rainy day fund\" she said was set up to impress Wall Street as   the state prepares to issue $10 billion in revenue bonds to cover its power   buying.   Transferring the money would leave the state general fund $2.4 billion in   debt, Connell said.   Sandy Harrison, spokesman for the state Department of Finance, and Keely   Bosler of the Legislative Analyst's Office, said such transfers are routine   and required by law.   They put the state's budget surplus at $5.6 billion.   Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio dismissed the criticism.   \"Political grandstanding doesn't generate one more kilowatt of energy for   California in this time of emergency,\" he said.   Connell is a candidate for mayor of Los Angeles in next month's election.   The ISO study, meanwhile, covered five major in-state power suppliers  )   Reliant, Dynegy, Williams/AES, Duke Energy and Mirant, as well as 16 power   importers. All deliver power to customers of Edison, PG&E and San Diego Gas &   Electric Co., the state's three largest investor-owned utilities.   \"All overcharged, but some excessively and some by moderate amounts,\" said   ISO's Sheffrin.   According to the report, the overcharging took place beginning last May, when   the energy crisis began, and continued through last month.   During that time, according to the report, energy suppliers commonly offered   their electricity at twice the amount it cost them to produce.   FERC member William L. Massey said he wasn't shocked to hear the amount   overcharged added up to more than $5 billion.   \"Prices over the past 10 months in California have greatly exceeded the   federal standards of just and reasonable prices, and I think they have   exceeded the standards by possibly billions of dollars,\" he said.   Chuck Griffin, spokesman for Atlanta-based Mirant said the company would   justify their charges to FERC officials.   \"I think we're missing sometimes just how basic the problem is in California.   Supply and demand are out of whack and some basic rules of economics kick in   when that happens,\" he said.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -------------    Disappearing state surplus sparks alarm         Controller puts hold on transfer of $5.6 billion to reserve funds  By Karen Kucher and Ed Mendel   UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITERS   March 22, 2001   The state's general fund surplus has dropped to $3.2 billion from $8.5   billion since January largely because California's power purchases are   devouring the money, state controller Kathleen Connell said yesterday.   Connell said she wants to see more documentation about state power spending   before approving the transfer of $5.6 billion from the general fund to a   special reserve fund requested by Gov. Gray Davis.   Connell said the state would have to borrow $2.4 billion to cover the   transfer.                   Report says power wholesalers overcharged California $5.5 billion   Outages darken economic outlook in state, some say   Out-of-state generators question power regulators' authority   Allegheny Energy makes big California connection   Enron stock slides despite earnings reassurance   California's electricity crisis at-a-glance   ?         \"We started this year with a generous budget surplus. The energy crisis has   taken much of that away, and this transfer on top of the electricity   purchases would put the (general) fund at risk,\" Connell said in a statement.   Her action came on a day when state power supplies improved. After two days   of forced outages this week, no rolling blackouts were ordered yesterday.   Several power plants came back on line and imports from the Pacific Northwest   provided enough electricity to meet demand yesterday, said Stephanie   McCorkle, a spokeswoman with the California Independent System Operator,   which manages most of the state's power grid.   \"Gradually more (electricity) generation comes on every day,\" McCorkle said.   \"By Monday, we should see somewhere around 2,200 megawatts back in service   that was not on this Monday. That's if no other generation falls off.\"   Meanwhile, Connell's move took some by surprise.   A spokesman for the state Department of Finance said Connell is denying a   routine transfer that is required by law. \"It was just a routine accounting   measure that we didn't anticipate becoming controversial,\" Sandy Harrison   said.   Connell announced the denial of the transfer a day after Davis endorsed one   of her opponents, former Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, in the race   for Los Angeles mayor.   Connell, who monitors California's cash flow, said she was \"deeply concerned   about putting the state's general fund in a deficit situation in light of the   energy crisis.\"   About two months ago, the state began spending about $50 million a day to buy   power after Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison nearly   went bankrupt. It is also purchasing power for customers of San Diego Gas and   Electric.   The Davis administration said earlier this week it soon will begin spending   an additional $500 million on power purchases, bringing the total to $4.2   billion.   As that staggering sum continues to grow, the state won a court battle with   an electricity supplier yesterday. A federal judge in Sacramento sided with   the state and ordered the wholesaler to continue selling to California   despite its fear that it will not get paid.   Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. said Californians were at risk of irreparable harm   if Reliant Energy Services stopped selling power to the Independent System   Operator. The ISO acquires last-minute power on behalf of utilities to fill   gaps in supply to try to fend off blackouts.   Damrell dismissed Reliant's attempt to force the state Department of Water   Resources to back the ISO's purchases for the state's two biggest utilities.   The judge said he had no authority to force the DWR to pay for the power.   Davis has said the state isn't responsible for purchasing the costly   last-minute power the ISO buys for Edison and PG&E, despite a law authorizing   state power purchases on the utilities' behalf.   Meanwhile, those who manage the power grid say the forecast for power   supplies this week looks good, although conditions can change quickly.   ISO managers continue to stress the importance of conservation. Utility   customers across the state conserved about 900 megawatts of power Tuesday,   which kept blackouts from being ordered that night.   As the power crisis worsened this week, ISO managers wished aloud that they   still could rely on business customers to shut down in exchange for lower   energy rates.   Such \"interruptible\" customers saved as much as 2,100 megawatts last spring,   a figure that dropped to about 1,700 last summer and 1,400 at the end of the   year. But in January, the state Public Utilities Commission told utilities   they could no longer impose fines on business customers who refuse to shut   down when asked.   ISO managers realize the program was harming businesses with frequent   interruptions of service -- but they still miss having that option, McCorkle   said.   \"It would have made an enormous difference, but at the same time we   understand the impact it was having on businesses,\" McCorkle said.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  --------------    Outages darken economic outlook in state, some say         By Dean Calbreath?  UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER   March 22, 2001   Until this week, the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce was predicting   that the county was well-insulated from the growing threat of economic   recession.   But that was before the lights went out in the chamber's downtown   headquarters Monday.   Working by window light in his darkened office, chamber economist Kelly   Cunningham rapidly erased his previous projections for 3.5 percent growth for   San Diego County. Cunningham now feels the local economy could fall into a   recession thanks to its shaky supply of energy.                   Report says power wholesalers overcharged California $5.5 billion   Disappearing state surplus sparks alarm   Out-of-state generators question power regulators' authority   Allegheny Energy makes big California connection   Enron stock slides despite earnings reassurance   California's electricity crisis at-a-glance   ?         \"Blackouts are very disruptive to the economy,\" Cunningham said. \"A business   can absorb rising energy prices by cutting costs or raising its own prices.   But an energy shutoff is much less predictable. It cuts into productivity.\"   Those sentiments are being echoed throughout California, as business leaders   and economists worry that rolling blackouts will darken the state's   previously glowing economy.   At the University of California Los Angeles, for instance, leading financial   theorists will meet April 4 to discuss the question \"Can California grow in   the dark?\" Although the topic was chosen before the recent string of power   outages, the blackouts have given the issue new urgency.   \"These blackouts are not just a single episode,\" said UCLA economist Tom   Lieser. \"They are a bridge to what will happen this summer. If we don't fall   into a recession in the second half of the year, we will fall pretty close.\"   Tapan Munroe, an economist formerly with Pacific Gas and Electric, this week   crossed out his projection for 2 percent statewide growth. After blackouts   rolled toward his consulting offices in the Bay Area city of Moraga, Munroe   decided the state will be lucky if it manages zero growth.   \"I'm a pretty optimistic guy by nature, but this has been sobering,\" Munroe   said. \"On Tuesday, one restaurant alone in San Francisco lost $20,000.   Multiply that by all of the businesses that lost power in the state and   you've got a serious problem.\"   Two days of blackouts in San Diego County have hurt businesses large and   small. Among the industries under threat is the local biotechnology sector,   which requires a steady supply of electricity to power areas of laboratories   that must remain temperature-controlled and sterile.   Continued blackouts \"could have a huge impact, not only in dollars, but   multiple millions of dollars,\" said Tom Oster, vice president of operations   for BioCom, the leading trade organization for the more than 200 biotechs in   San Diego County.   Idun Pharmaceuticals, a biotech near La Jolla Village Drive that has 67   employees, had its power cut for about 40 minutes Tuesday. Though the company   has a back-up generator, some segments of its laboratories and lab equipment   were not supported by it. Chemists also had to turn off some sensitive lab   equipment to avoid the possibility of a damaging power surge once the   blackout was over.   \"We're not in a position as a small company to back up the whole facility,\"   said Steven Mento, Idun's chief executive. \"We haven't done a survey yet to   determine whether we had losses, either in experiments or equipment damaged   -- but we're hoping because the blackout was so short that damage will be   minimal.\"   Mento said rolling blackouts, coupled with continuing high energy costs,   could cripple many small biotechs -- and even take a bite out of bigger, more   established companies.   \"We generate new compounds in controlled environments on a daily basis, and   when power goes off you can lose samples because of contamination and other   issues,\" Mento said. \"We are fortunate that our losses would be in having to   repeat an experiment -- but this could be really critical for companies with   drug manufacturing and issues of quality control.\"   The wireless firms along Sorrento Valley have not been immune from blackouts.   The lights went out at Qualcomm early this week, although executives declined   to comment about the impact.   No blackouts hit the big shipbuilding operations on the waterfront this week.   But the National Steel and Shipbuilding Co. -- one of San Diego's largest   employers -- already experienced a voluntary loss of power this year, its   first since World War II. Since the shipyard does not have its own power   supply, NASSCO executives fear the effect of unplanned outages.   \"Our average payroll totals half a million dollars a day,\" said NASSCO   spokesman Jim Scott. \"When you have a day's work disrupted, that can be   pretty serious. We're currently in discussions about the possibility of   buying from independent power suppliers, or setting up a power plant of our   own.\"   Small businesses, which constitute the bulk of employment in San Diego   County, were hurt by disruptions as well -- costing them vital revenue at a   time when their power bills have skyrocketed.   At Fantastic Sam's, a hair salon in Chula Vista, Angelica Alcala estimated   that business dropped 60 percent when the blackouts hit Tuesday. Among other   things, Alcala had to alter her planned haircuts because she was relying on   scissors instead of electric clippers.   At the Family Fun Center in El Cajon, the management gave vouchers or refunds   to the 15 or so video-game players who were in the midst of killing aliens or   fighting ninja warriors as the power went down.   Papa John's Pizza estimates that it may have lost several thousand dollars in   business after six stores were blacked out Monday and four others lost power   Tuesday. Brian Mills, who runs 23 Papa John's stores in the county, said his   main concern was shutting down the computers so they would not be damaged by   a power surge when the electricity was restored.   Paul Ecke III, a member of the West Coast advisory panel for the Federal   Reserve, said the potential impact of the energy crisis \"is worse than any   downturn in the stock market.\"   Ecke, who runs the Paul Ecke Ranch flower operation in Encinitas, said the   crisis could be particularly harmful for the state's agricultural sector,   since farmers need electricity to pump water and natural gas to heat   greenhouses.   \"What I'm really worried about is the energy thing is going to cast a shadow   on California,\" he said. \"If you're a business person thinking about moving   to California right now, you're probably not going to do it because you're   not sure you're going to have your lights on this summer.\"   Besides the disruption to businesses, the energy crisis is also hurting the   pocketbooks of hourly workers who have been sent home during the crisis.   Under state law, employers are free to send hourly workers home without pay   during such emergencies, although salaried workers must still be paid.   Susan Kemp, an attorney with the California Chamber of Commerce, said there   are ways of minimizing the impact on hourly workers.   \"You have to look at what time it is when the blackout occurs and how long   you think it's going to last,\" Kemp said. \"If it's around a meal time, you   might send the workers out for a longer meal period if you think it's going   to be an hour or hour and a half delay.\"   But the potential for losing wages doesn't sit well with the hourly workers.   \"When you get sent home early and lose your wages, you have even less money   to pay your inflated energy bills,\" said an hourly worker who was sent home   during Monday's blackout.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------      Out-of-state generators question power regulators' authority         By Karen Gaudette  ASSOCIATED PRESS   March 22, 2001   SAN FRANCISCO  ) At least three major out-of-state electricity generators are   challenging the authority of the California Public Utilities Commission to   investigate whether they deliberately reduced power supplies to drive up   prices.   The PUC has asked for power plant maintenance records as it tries to   determine whether Duke Energy, Dynegy Inc., Mirant Corp. and other   wholesalers have manipulated the energy market at California's expense.   At issue is who ultimately controls oversight of in-state plants that provide   most of California's electricity. The plants, once owned by the state's   largest utilities, were sold off as part of the state's 1996 attempt at   deregulation.                   Report says power wholesalers overcharged California $5.5 billion   Disappearing state surplus sparks alarm   Outages darken economic outlook in state, some say   Allegheny Energy makes big California connection   Enron stock slides despite earnings reassurance   California's electricity crisis at-a-glance   ?         PUC President Loretta Lynch said the public deserves to know whether   generators have unnecessarily taken plants off-line to create artificial   shortages, forcing the utilities and now state bureaucrats to buy much higher   priced power on the spot energy market.   \"What I do know is we have historically high levels of outages across the   board,\" Lynch told The Associated Press. \"Dynegy and Duke have been fighting   the PUC in the PUC's quest to obtain documents about these outages.\"   The PUC has the authority to regulate facilities within its borders, she   added. \"It doesn't matter where the headquarters of the company is.\"   Duke, based in North Carolina, says it does matter  ) and that since it and   other wholesalers aren't headquartered in California, the PUC can't require   it to turn over the maintenance records.   \"We have not given them proprietary information because they do not regulate   us,\" said Duke's spokesman, Tom Williams.   Dynegy did not return calls for comment Wednesday.   The PUC also faces a new challenge in the legislature. A bill sponsored by   Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco, which would have granted the   PUC greater inspection authority over out-of-state generators, was amended   this month to grant the authority to Independent System Operator instead.   The ISO has managed the delivery of energy through most of the state's power   grid but historically has done little regulating and has had no policing   authority.   This board, created during the state's 1996 attempt at deregulation, was   redesigned in January. Now it has a five-member board appointed by Davis,   replacing a 26-member ISO board composed of utility executives, marketers,   power plant owners and others.   The latest version of Migden's bill requires wholesalers to report monthly to   the ISO about any plants that are off-line or working at reduced capacity,   and gives the ISO power to audit these reports.   But because the ISO board historically has made key decisions behind closed   doors and is exempt from certain open-government regulations, government   watchdogs are outraged by the switch.   \"The PUC's been no friend of ratepayers, but at least under the constitution   and state law they're required to conduct their process in the open and the   public can intervene,\" said Harvey Rosenfield of the Foundation for Taxpayer   and Consumer Rights.   Davis ordered last month that the ISO take the lead among state agencies to   ensure adequate energy supplies. Alan LoFaso, an aide to Migden, said the   amendment follows Davis' lead.   Both LoFaso and the governor's spokesman, Steve Maviglio, downplayed the   change. \"I don't know if we have a preference\" as to which state agency gets   the authority to continue the probe, Maviglio said.   The challenge by Duke Energy, Houston-based Dynegy Inc. and Mirant Corp. of   Atlanta came in filings March 12 asking for a rehearing of the PUC's February   resolution reasserting its legal authority to \"examine the books, accounts,   memoranda, contracts and records\" of generators selling energy to utilities   already subject to PUC regulation.   Those utilities include Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California   Edison Co., which have been nearly bankrupted buying power from wholesalers,   as well as the financially troubled San Diego Gas and Electric  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------    Allegheny Energy makes big California connection         ASSOCIATED PRESS   March 22, 2001   HAGERSTOWN, Md.  ) Allegheny Energy Inc. said Thursday it has agreed to sell   $4.5 billion worth of power to California's electricity-purchasing agency   over the next 10 years.   The company said the contract call for Allegheny to provide up to 1,000   megawatts that the Hagerstown-based company has secured from western   generating plants through its new energy trading division, Allegheny Energy   Global Markets  ) formerly Merrill Lynch Global Energy Markets.   \"This is a win-win for both the state of California and Allegheny Energy. It   provides a long-term source of fixed-price energy and should help to   stabilize prices in California,\" said Michael P.

Donnelly could lead to a   mass exodus by hundreds of small energy producers that have been selling   power to the state's financially troubled utilities for months without   getting paid.  ?????At the same time, it may have staved off plans by a group of the small   generators to send Edison into involuntary bankruptcy as early as today.  ?????In Sacramento, energy legislation pushed by Gov. Gray Davis passed in   the state Senate but foundered in the Assembly. The measure was intended to   ensure that the state gets repaid for the electricity that it has been buying   on behalf of Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric, which say they lack the cash   and credit to purchase power. The bill also was supposed to guarantee that   the small, alternative energy producers--which together provide nearly a   third of the state's power--get paid. But Assembly Republicans opposed it,   saying it hadn't been given sufficient scrutiny.  ?????The impact of the small producers was made clear in Imperial County,   where Edison's failure to pay CalEnergy, the county's biggest property   taxpayer, had outsize implications. CalEnergy had put county officials on   notice that it was about to miss a $3.8-million property tax payment. The   uncertainty had prompted the tiny Calipatria Unified School District to   postpone a bond issue for badly needed school repairs.  ?????Among CalEnergy Chairman David Sokol's first acts after the judge's   ruling Thursday was to promise Imperial County Supervisor Wally J. Leimgruber   that the company would pay its property taxes on time.  ?????\"That is great news,\" Leimgruber said.  ?????Within hours of its court victory, CalEnergy had stopped transmitting   geothermal power to Edison and begun selling it to El Paso Energy, a   marketing company that purchased the energy at prevailing rates and resold it   on the spot market.  ?????Some of the more than 700 other small energy producers in the state said   they were considering similar action against Edison and Pacific Gas &   Electric.  ?????\"We absolutely need the right to sell to third parties,\" said Dean   Vanech, president of Delta Power, a New Jersey company that owns five small   gas-fired plants in California and is owed tens of millions of dollars by   Edison.  ?????Sokol praised the Imperial County judge and said his company simply   wanted the authority to sell its power \"to a credit-worthy company that, in   fact, pays for the power.\"  ?????An Edison spokesman said the company was disappointed with the ruling,   but sympathized with CalEnergy and other small producers because   \"California's power crisis has placed [them] in financial distress, just as   it has placed utilities in financial distress.\"  ?????Edison expressed concern that the ruling would prompt CalEnergy and   other small producers to sell their power out of state. Sokol said CalEnergy   had specifically told El Paso Energy that it hoped its power would remain in   California, \"but if someone wants to pay a higher price out of state, we   can't stop them.\"  ?????Sokol said that Edison still owes CalEnergy $140 million and that the   company--along with seven other small producers--had been prepared to file a   petition in federal bankruptcy court in Los Angeles today forcing the utility   into involuntary bankruptcy. He said his company no longer intends to do so,   and he believed--but wasn't certain--that the other companies would shelve   their plans.  ?????Edison filed papers Thursday with the federal Securities and Exchange   Commission showing that it owed $840 million to various small electricity   producers, many of which rely on renewable energy sources such as geothermal   steam, solar energy or wind.  ?????The alternative energy producers--and utilities--strenuously objected to   the legislation considered in Sacramento on Thursday. The bill, spelling out   how the utilities are to pay the state and the small producers, passed the   Senate on a 27-9 vote, the exact two-thirds margin required. But it stalled   in the Assembly on a 46-23 party-line vote, well short of two-thirds.  ?????\"When I was a citizen back in Lancaster, I heard these stories about   pieces of legislation that were cooked up late at night, that . . . were cut   and pasted together and were rammed through by the Legislature,\" Assemblyman   George Runner (R-Lancaster) said. \"That's exactly what we have before us.\"  ?????The alternative electricity generators, including oil companies, warned   that they would lose money under the Davis proposal, while representatives of   Edison and PG&E, which have amassed billions in debt in the worsening energy   crisis, said the legislation would push them deeper into the hole.  ?????\"There isn't enough money,\" Edison attorney Ann Cohn testified at a   Senate hearing on the bill Thursday. \"It is a very simple question: Dollars   going out cannot be greater than dollars coming in.\"  ?????The bill, AB 8X, combined several proposals. First, it sought to clarify   earlier legislation by spelling out that Edison and PG&E must pay the state   all money collected from consumers for electricity that the state has been   buying.  ?????Additionally, the bill would turn over to the California Public   Utilities Commission the thorny issue of how much to pay alternative energy   producers for their electricity.  ?????Wind, solar and geothermal producers might agree to the prices offered   by the administration. But most of the alternative energy producers,   including Chevron and British Petroleum, use natural gas to generate   electricity through \"cogeneration,\" a process of creating steam for both   electric generation and heat. With natural gas prices high, they contend,   they would lose money at the prices Davis is offering.  ---   ?????Ellingwood reported from El Centro, Morain from Sacramento.

Like several cities that own their own utilities, Lodi saw the energy crunch   looming last fall and spent millions for long-term power contracts in an   attempt to avoid blackouts.   Now, Lodi and a Northern California municipal utility cooperative that   includes Palo Alto, Santa Clara and Alameda are telling Pacific Gas and   Electric Co. that it's unfair to force their customers to endure blackouts   triggered by the near-bankrupt utility's failure to pay its debts.   \"The problem is not paying bills, so pay the bills,\" said Alan Vallow,   director of the utility serving Lodi's 58,000 residents. \"I won't arbitrarily   screw my customers . . . so 5,000 PG&E customers can turn on their lights   somewhere else.\"   When PG&E relayed an order from state power regulators Monday and Tuesday for   Lodi to black out some of its customers, a strategy intended to keep the   West's power grid from collapsing, Lodi said no.   So far, other cities in the Northern California Power Agency say they will   continue to participate in rotating outages.   But in a letter last Friday to PG&E, members of the agency and four other   utility districts, including Sacramento's, warned they didn't believe long-   standing agreements that allow them to use PG&E transmission lines to connect   to the grid obliged them to endure rolling blackouts because of \"PG&E's   failure to pay its power obligations.\"   They say the agreements require them to reduce power demand only in response   to natural disasters or malfunctions damaging power lines or plants.   The agencies asked for a meeting with PG&E President Gordon Smith before   anticipated summer blackouts hit, \"to develop a more rational program for   allocation of risks associated with (power demand) load shedding before you   call on us to participate in load shedding again.\"   REFUSING TO SHARE BURDEN  PG&E officials accused Lodi of selfishly refusing to share the burden of the   statewide energy crisis.   \"It is regrettable that after reaping the benefits of the (power grid)   interconnection contract for many years, Lodi is suddenly unwilling to bear   their share of the burden of the statewide energy crisis,\" said PG&E   spokesman Ron Low. \"When cities like Lodi do not follow the (state   Independent System Operator's) order to curtail power, it hurts all of   California and jeopardizes the entire power grid.\"   Low also disagreed with accusations that this week's blackouts were triggered   by PG&E's failure to pay its bills, noting that the ISO stated that 12,000   megawatts of power were offline because of plant maintenance.   But ISO spokeswoman Lisa Szot confirmed assertions by the municipal utilities   that power generators had kept an additional 3,000 megawatts offline because   they feared PG&E couldn't pay.   Lodi's Vallow said he was legally obliged to serve city customers. Lodi   residents are facing rate increases of as much as 15 percent under a power   contract that the city secured in hopes of avoiding blackouts. The contract   required Lodi to pay a $10 million premium above its typical $23 million   annual energy bill.   'THAT'S NOT FAIR'   \"I've been hearing (PG&E say), 'Gee, that's not fair. Where's the equity if   everybody is doing rolling blackouts and you're not?' \" Vallow said. \"Well, I   put my customers at financial risk to the tune of $10 million. And if they're   not going to get to use that power they paid for, then by God, give us that   money back.\"   Vallow said he was willing to sell PG&E some of Lodi's power surplus, knowing   Lodi might not be paid.   \"But I'm not willing to turn off 5,000 customers, so 5,000 customers   somewhere else can turn their lights on,\" Vallow said. \"The objective here,   people, is to keep as many lights on as possible.\"   Other city-owned utilities, while annoyed with the rolling blackouts, aren't   going as far as Lodi.   WEATHERING BLACKOUTS  \"I certainly understand the frustrations of utilities like Lodi and actually   share those frustrations in many cases,\" said John Roukema, assistant   director of Santa Clara's utility.   But he stressed that his agency had been able to weather blackouts without   hurting residents or small business, because 17 major industrial power users   had agreed to curtail demand during energy alerts.   \"The prudent thing to do at this time is to continue to do our share and   participate in rolling blackouts, because a single problem could cause a   catastrophic failure in the statewide system,\" Roukema said.   In Alameda, residents endured blackouts this week despite the fact that city   has secured reliable power supplies, said Matt McCabe, spokesman for Alameda   Power & Telecom.   \"It was in the best of interests of Alamedans to maintain the stability and   integrity of the grid,\" he said. \"Now, if it becomes evident that the system   is being jeopardized for financial reasons, then we should not have to   subject Alamedans to rolling blackouts.\"   In Palo Alto, which also had blackouts this week, utility officials told the   City Council they were expecting a 30 to 40 percent rate hike this spring to   pay new contracts guaranteeing a stable power supply, said Councilman Bern   Beecham. The city hopes to avoid giving customers the double whammy of rate   boosts and more blackouts with a program that gets industrial users to cut   demand voluntarily during alerts.   \"When there's not enough generating capacity in the state to protect the   integrity of the grid, that is in fact everybody's problem,\" Beecham said,   but that doesn't mean Palo Alto is willing to endure blackouts to prop up   PG&E's ailing finances.   \"We need to have some very frank discussions with PG&E about mutual   obligations,\" Beecham said.   Energy Tips   With Californians facing electricity and natural gas shortages, PG&E has   several tips to help conserve both:   -- Set the furnace thermostat at 68 degrees or lower, health permitting.   -- Wash only full loads in a dishwasher. If operating instructions allow,   turn dishwasher off before the drying cycle and let dishes dry naturally.   -- Use low-wattage or fluorescent lights.   -- Fix defective plumbing and dripping faucets, which waste water and   increase the gas or electric bill for heating the water.   -- Plug gaps around pipes, ducts, fans and vents that go through walls,   ceilings and floors.   -- Keep furnaces clean, and clean or replace the filter regularly.   -- Turn heaters down when using a fireplace, and close the damper when not   using the fireplace.   -- On sunny days, open drapes on windows facing south and let the sun shine   in. At night, close the drapes to retain indoor heat.   Source: www.pge.com   E-mail Alan Gathright at agathright@sfchronicle.com.   ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle ?

The sudden action on a series of energy bills -- including one to let   businesses buy power directly from generators -- stemmed initially from the   fear of bad publicity lawmakers might receive for a planned three-day junket   next week to Washington, D.C.   When a key bill bogged down in the Assembly late yesterday, Speaker Bob   Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks, announced the trip was canceled.   Another reason for the flurry of action was recognition that time is running   out.   Several alternative energy producers -- like wind farms and biomass plants -   - said they were one day away from forcing the state's two biggest utilities   into bankruptcy because they were owed more than $1 billion.   The Legislature's action and a court ruling that could free alternative   producers from unpaid contracts.   \"This is triage, members of the Senate,\" said Sen. Jim Costa, D-Fresno. \"This   is crisis activity we're engaged in.\"   The Senate approved a bill aimed at helping state regulators get cash to some   alternative energy producers. Most of them have been paid little or nothing   since November by the utilities they sell electricity to.   Senators passed a bill to help the Public Utilities Commission order   utilities to pay solar, wind and other alternative energy producers who sign   lower-priced contracts with the utilities.   The bill failed in the Assembly because of GOP opposition, fanned in part by   price concerns by the oil industry, a major co-generation producer. The   Assembly is set to meet again today to try again pass the bill, which the PUC   needs to issue its final order.   The PUC's proposed order offers the first hint of financial relief for   hundreds of alternative energy producers, known as ''qualified facilities\" in   the energy industry, who have been paid just pennies on the dollar by cash-   strapped Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison.   Lack of payments has caused many alternative generators to shutter their   operations.   The PUC's proposal, which will be considered at the commission's meeting   Tuesday, offers generators a choice of agreeing to a five-year contract at   $79 per megawatt or a 10-year deal at $69 per megawatt, Davis said. The going   rate now is about $150 a megawatt hour.   The order does not address money already owed to the more than 600   alternative energy producers.   Under the order, utilities would have to pay any generator who signed the new   contracts within two weeks.   But PG&E said it might not be able to afford do that.   Operators of co-generation facilities say the contracts contemplated by the   PUC don't cover their cost of producing energy because the sale price no   longer would be pegged to the the price of natural gas.   In a significant court decision affecting generators, one geothermal energy   supplier in Imperial County won a lawsuit yesterday against Edison allowing   the company to escape a contract requiring it to sell electricity to the   utility.   A superior court judge said CalEnergy, operator of the geothermal plant,   could suspend deliveries to Edison and sell the 268 megawatt hours it   generated on the open market.   CalEnergy is owed $75 million by the utility.   The court victory may ease mounting pressure from some qualified facilities,   including CalEnergy, to drive one or both of the utilities into involuntary   bankruptcy.   The Assembly and Senate, meanwhile, rushed through a series of bills aimed at   increasing energy conservation, and rushing the building of new power plants.   Most significant for bigger residential and commercial utility customers is a   measure passed by the Assembly to allow energy customers to buy power   directly from generators.   That right was eliminated in January when the state began buying power for   the cash-strapped utilities.   The bill approved unanimously yesterday would impose a yet to be determined   exit fee on customers who leave the power grid to help cover the state's   financial exposure.

At the current rate of spending, the report estimated that the total   electricity bill in California this year could hit $70 billion, which is more   than twice what it was last year and about 10 times what was paid in 1999 and   1998.   ``The California electricity market has gone from being `dysfunctional' to   precipitating a crisis,'' according to the report from the Independent System   Operator.   It added that the price being charged ``threatens any semblance of just and   reasonable consumer rates, the financial viability of California's   investor-owned utilities, the financial stability of California, of its   neighboring states and of the nation.''   While power suppliers denied any wrongdoing, the report said the state   appears to have been hit with ``excess'' charges totaling $6.87 billion since   May, based on an assessment of the typical operating costs of power plant   owners. Out of that total, $6.2 billion appeared to be excessive charges   during times when power was not in particularly short supply, the agency   said.   The cost of power has become a growing concern now that the state has stepped   in to buy it on behalf of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California   Edison, which claim to be so strapped for cash that they are on the verge of   bankruptcy.   In making public the report, which was sent to the Federal Energy Regulatory   Commission, officials at the Independent System Operator were careful not to   accuse any power companies of price gouging. While the prices appeared to be   unreasonable, they said, the state needs to learn more about the specific   operating costs of power plant operators before they could determine whether   California was cheated.   The officials said they were considering asking the federal agency, which   oversees power wholesalers, to order the suppliers to make refunds. In the   past two weeks, the federal agency has warned a number of suppliers that they   may have to refund $135 million in apparent overcharges during January and   February.   But many experts question whether the federal agency is serious about   demanding such refunds, so California officials also are reviewing the   possibility of suing the suppliers or seeking criminal charges against some   of them. ``We're working very closely with a number of agencies to review the   information we currently have to determine what remedies may be available,''   said Charles Robinson, the Independent System Operator's general counsel.   The report's suspicions were partly bolstered by another study made public   Thursday by the state auditor. It said California's market structure   encouraged bidding gamesmanship by both utilities and power sellers ``in an   effort to manipulate wholesale prices to their advantage.'' But it stopped   short of accusing power generators of profiting illegally.   ``There's clearly some evidence of market abuse,'' said state Auditor Elaine   Howle. Even so, she added, ``that's not to say it's anything illegal. We   hired consultants, they looked at some of the bidding, and they weren't   comfortable going that far.''   Although no power companies were named in either report, officials with   several suppliers insisted they have done nothing wrong.   ``We've conducted our business legally and ethically,'' said Richard   Wheatley, spokesman for Reliant Energy, which runs five major California   power plants. ``The ISO report appears to be nothing more than just another   attempt to put blame at someone else's doorstep, when there's been very   little action out of Sacramento to resolve the problems in the California   marketplace.''   Duke Energy spokesman Jeremy Dreier said the company, which runs plants in   Moss Landing and Morro Bay, sold most of its power last year and this year in   relatively low-cost, long-term contracts, and was among the first to offer   such deals to the state. He added that Duke increased production from its   aging plants to meet surging demand.   ``The fact that we were among the first to bring long-term contracts to the   table speaks volumes about how we're trying to serve this market,'' Dreier   said.   John Sousa of Dynegy Inc., which co-owns three major California plants, added   that ``given the market conditions, the rates we charged were just and   reasonable.''   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -------------------------------------------------                Plan for alternate power plants stalls   Posted at 10:03 p.m. PST Thursday, March 22, 2001   BY DION NISSENBAUM AND JENNIFER BJORHUS     Mercury News       SACRAMENTO -- The state's prospects for plugging a critical electricity gap   dimmed Thursday when the state Assembly rejected a rescue plan for   alternative power companies and a state judge ruled that one such firm could   stop selling energy in California.   Both actions threaten the plan Gov. Gray Davis announced just Tuesday to keep   these companies running and stave off more blackouts. With the state's   troubled utilities failing to pay for their electricity, many alternative   energy plants have been shutting down.   The dual blows came on a day when tempers flared in the Capitol as lawmakers   jarred by back-to-back blackouts launched bipartisan attacks on Pacific Gas &   Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, which aren't paying wind, solar,   biomass, geothermal and small gas-fired plants for their electricity.   After Republicans shot down the measure meant to keep alternative energy   companies in business, Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, warned   that the restless companies might act on their threat to force the utilities   into bankruptcy.   ``They said it, and I understood them to mean it,'' he said.   The failure overshadowed a burst of action in Sacramento where lawmakers   approved a host of other measures. The Senate approved two key bills: one   that would spend more than $1 billion to encourage Californians to conserve   energy and one that would make it easier to build power plants. The Assembly   approved 14 incremental bills.   Six votes short   But the Assembly fell six votes short of passing a hastily prepared bill   meant to help prop up the nearly 700 alternative energy companies, many of   which are now idle.   Those closings sapped California of energy this week and helped cause two   days of rolling blackouts -- the first since January.   In response, Davis and lawmakers cobbled together a plan to set new, lower   rates for alternative power and to fine the utilities if they refuse to pay   these companies, which supply up to a third of the state's power.   But Republicans refused to back the measure and said it contained too many   complex parts that needed more time to analyze.   ``Everyone in this room knows that this piece of legislation has not had a   good look,'' said Assemblyman George Runner, R-Lancaster.   Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Santa Cruz, castigated the Republicans and   implored them to accept an imperfect solution.   ``Ladies and gentlemen: Welcome to the NFL,'' he said. ``Welcome to the world   where large, complex issues don't have a simple solution.''   Approval is needed before state regulators at the Public Utilities Commission   can vote on the fine points of the plan. That was supposed to happen Tuesday.   Much of the criticism focused on concerns raised by power plants that use   natural gas to produce energy. Administrators from those plants said the   Davis price caps would make it impossible for them to break even.   The derailment came hours after the measure narrowly won approval in the   state Senate.   Hertzberg plans to search for a compromise today and canceled plans for the   Assembly's annual trip to Washington.   Thursday's actions were highlighted by angry attacks on the utilities by   frustrated lawmakers.   ``I hope they do go bankrupt,'' shouted Senate President pro tem John Burton,   D-San Francisco, during a debate on the energy crisis. ``Let them go belly   up. I don't care any more.''   Legal decision adds twist   The legislative failure was compounded by a legal decision in Southern   California that further complicated the picture.   A Superior Court judge in Imperial County cleared the way for CalEnergy   Operating Corp. to break its contract with Edison and sell its 268 megawatts   of power on the open market. The judge concluded that Edison had breached its   contract by failing to pay CalEnergy since November.   That ruling could pave the way for hundreds of others to follow suit and   drain off power California needs to prevent blackouts.   ``It's not good,'' said V. John White, director of the Center for Energy   Efficiency and Renewable Technologies. ``This is potentially going to change   the dynamics of the situation, and probably not for the better.''   Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers   Association, said it was unclear whether other companies would sue.   ``I think this is a very significant development,'' he said. ``We're sort of   at a period where the industry's reaching the end of the rope.''   The ruling did have one silver lining: CalEnergy Chairman David Sokol said   his company and seven others had planned to force Edison into bankruptcy if   they lost in court.   But he also warned, ``You stick a sharp stick in enough people's eyes, and   they get pretty tired of it.''   The situation with generators supplying PG&E isn't as dire since the company   has been making partial payments.

		"_body" : "Sorry I missed your call last night.  I had a good cry and went to bed early.     As you noted in your voice message, I am planning to travel by myself on Saturday, Dec 15.  It is the only time I can get a confirmed flight (albeit a more cumbersome route and more expensive).     Here is the other part of my plans.  I feel fairly sure that I will return to the US immediately after my court date, unless the stay requirements are very, very short.  I can fathom the courage to travel by myself, but not to hang around 2 weeks by myself.  Also, all these constant changes have put a serious strain on what is already a very tedious work situation for me.   I am still planning to have Connie move forward with getting Kim a letter of invitation /VISAs -- including a Russian VISA that is good until Mid-January.  That way Kim can return for Alina after the first of the year if necessary.  Please ask Sergei to look into possible arrangements.  I would be happy to pay for Sergei and Larisa to have a holiday in Moscow if they were willing to fly with Alina there.  Perhaps she could stay at the orphanage or with a host family and have an orphanage worker take her to Almaty.     I am totally terrified about traveling by myself  -- but this isn't a fear that will ease with time.  I feel like I just have to dive in or I am going to change my mind.   I need some reassurance on what happens at the airport.  Will the assistance service help me at customs?  Will Sergei pick me up and where will I find him?  Do I have hotel accomodations (if so preferrably at the Hyatt)?   Obviously I am also handling a mountain of guilt about leaving without Liz.  I wrote her a note about my current thoughts on travel and why I am leaning towards leaving on Sat.   Shelley Corman 713-853-7083",

As Chair   Herbert said:  SPP should have read the Commission ,s order in May and taken   it more seriously.  (Issues for possible rehearing are ****).    ? The Commission declined to approve SPP ,s scope and configuration because   the SPP members remain uncommitted to the RTO and have not made a decision to   transfer operational control and the SPP/Entergy relationship remains   somewhat undefined.  The Commission wants to see evidence of serious efforts   to form RTOs that combine current RTO proposals and Entergy and SPP must file   a report by May 25 addressing this scope issue.     o Bulk power sales and purchase figures indicate that natural markets extend   beyond the SPP RTO borders.  There are significant sales and purchases   between SPP and SERC (and Midwest companies to a lesser extent.)   o Expect the existing TOs to file Section 203 applications to transfer   control of transmission to SPP.   o MOU must be clarified to demonstrate that the minimum requirements of an   RTO, such as operational authority, ATC calculation and planning/expansion,   will be met.    ? Approves Entergy ,s proposal for a Managing Member that controls all voting   rights to the Transco and approves Entergy ,s Board approval process (states   that Entergy would control no more than two of the selection committee ,s   seven members).     ? Allows Southwestern Public Service Company to satisfy its merger obligation   by joining SPP instead of MISO.    ? The Commission did not address EPMI ,s motion to condition market based rate   authority on RTO participation.******  ",

My understanding of this is as follows:  In the event of bankruptcy, employees are guaranteed to be paid for work already completed up to an amount of $4650 (If the company were to file next week, this amount should be small since payday was today).  In addition, employees are paid for hours worked after bankruptcy at their normal salary or an amount the judge determines and such payments are not capped at $4650.      -----Original Message----- From:  Enron Announcements/Corp/Enron@ENRON   On Behalf Of Ken Lay - Office of the Chairman@ENRON Sent: Friday, November 30, 2001 5:58 PM To: All Enron Employees United States Group@ENRON Subject: UPDATE - Reporting to Work Next Week   Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.  I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.  We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.  While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.  I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.  Ken",

I will schedule time to visit with anyone that missed the staff meeting.  I know that you are all still searching for answers to the Enron events of the last few weeks.   You asked lots of good questions at the meeting.  At the bottom of this email are responses to a few additional questions.  As I said at the meeting, while I am discouraged by recent events, I am really proud of ETS and of our Gas Logistics Team and I am looking forward to showing off our pipeline successes to the Dynegy management team in the future.   With the Thanksgiving holiday just around the corner, I'd like to take the opportunity to wish you and your family a safe and happy holiday season.  I hope that you can spend time with your families and friends away from the demands of work.  I'd also like to put two dates on your calendar to celebrate work accomplishments with our team.  Team Celebration.  First, I hope you can attend a celebration on November 29 at the Doubletree honoring the Gas Logistics team and the new Contracts/Capacity Release team.  The celebration will include food, games and prizes.  Alma Carillo will be sending out all the details.   Holiday Luncheon.  Second, get out your recipe books and start cooking, because it's also time for our Gas Logistics Holiday Banquet on December 11th in ECN42C2 from 11:30am - 1:30pm.  I'll provide the ham and turkey and team members can sign-up to bring a covered dish.  Ricki Winters will send around a sign-up sheet to make sure that we don't end up with 10 green bean casseroles.   Follow-Up Q/A  Can Employees still order computers from the Click at Home program? As of today, the Click at Home program has not been cancelled.  The web site is working and eligible employees are able to place orders.  Regarding loans from the Saving Plan, is there any requirement for accelerated loan payment if the value of the loan exceeds the current value of the savings plan account? For active employees, loan payment amounts will not change during the term of the loan, even if the outstanding balance of the loan exceeds the value of the account.  Does the company have any position on employee participation in class action suits?   No.  The decision whether to participate in a suit is a personal decision and is unrelated to an individual's employment.   ",

At the bottom of the schedule, I've made a simplistic cut between short-term/long-term based on the expiration date.    For example, for calendar year 1997: Short-term  = Firm contracts with contract expiration date before 12/31/98  + all IT & PNR revenues Long-term = Firm contracts with expiration dates in 1999 and beyond.   Same logic for years, 1998, 1999, 2000.  Call me at x37083 if you have questions.    ",

On the longer range issue; however, I need to elevate my level of concern that the moves are having on customer service issues.  Since Tropical Storm Allison, ETS has experienced one computer system outage after another; including the virus problem the week before last.  This morning our scheduling system is out and we are having Internet problems -- both of which are impacting customer nominations.  During system outages it is imperative that gas logistics be able to mobilize and implement back-up plans to ensure customer transactions.  This is best handled by having a central staging area.  I realize these system reliablity problems have nothing to do with our moves or with the ultimate location of the Gas Logistics group.  Certainly I am pursuing these reliability concerns with Steve Hotte.  But, in light of these issues, I would like to talk about the timing & end state of where Gas Logistics is to be located and how long it is going to take to make this happen.   I know that your first priority of late has been to get us off 41.  Now that that has happened, I'd like to talk about the timing for which floor remodeling comes next (39, 42, etc) and the ramifications for my group. ",

Conceivably, we could have two or three or more months of PPAs to process during any given commodity close, depending on when the charts are received, and the necessary time allocated for processing that does not interfere with the current month's business. As I also mentioned, we currently have no way to systematically determine which stations that charts have not been received from, and require PPAs. This is a labor intensive process to make the determinations and complete the PPA process. To my knowledge, the field is still working on a plan to expedite charts to Houston for processing. Until such time that the charts can be received for processing prior to close, we will have to continue to process the data twice; closing with the index readings to accommodate the GISB 5th work day requirements , and again when the charts arrive to accommodate determining the daily values. We probably need to look at this entire process, starting at the field level,  to completion of the billing process to ensure that the expectations are realistic for all involved, and we are pursuing the best course of action. Additionally, some of the existing timelines and deadlines in the process may need to be changed until physical equipment is installed in the field to eliminate the problem. A note of observation: no charts for the last half of December, with the exception of the ones that are over-nighted from Minnegasco, has been received by GMS for the close on 1/08/02.

State regulators are weighing a 30 percent hike on electricity rates that   would come on top of a smaller, temporary rate increase that was adopted in   January. The temporary increase also is expected to be made permanent today   by the Public Utilities Commission.   Still to be determined is the question of who will bear the brunt of the rate   increases, which are expected to appear on the May bills of California's 7.5   million utility customers.   Loretta Lynch, president of the Public Utilities Commission, said the rate   increases are needed to replenish more than $4 billion in ongoing electricity   purchases by the state treasury and allow utilities to continue to buy   electricity from alternative energy companies.   The rate increase also satisfies conditions that are needed before the state   can borrow $10 billion or more to finance its power buys.   Lynch also said she will propose a tiered rate structure that would penalize   those who use the most electricity and leave nearly half the state's utility   customers, who use relatively little, untouched by the increase.   Seen as inevitable by many observers, the politically volatile issue of rate   hikes is nevertheless another admission that the state's foray into   electricity deregulation, which was supposed to lead to cheaper and more   plentiful electricity, has failed.   Consumer groups, calling the proposed rate hikes a $4.8 billion gift to   utilities, responded by saying they would hasten plans to take the state's   energy mess to voters through a ballot initiative. Among their proposals:   rolling back rates, forcing a state takeover of power plants or implementing   an excess profits tax on energy companies.   \"The ratepayer revolt is under way,\" said Harvey Rosenfield, president of the   Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. \"The voters are going to have to   take matters into their own hands at the ballot box. It will be a bloodbath.\"   Meanwhile, Gov. Gray Davis immediately distanced himself from the rate-hike   proposal.   \"The governor believes tiered pricing could promote the conservation   California needs if structured properly but was not convinced of that by the   data made available to him last week,\" according to a statement from Davis'   office Monday. \"He has asked for more information, which should be available   this week. The governor has not had conversations with any commissioners   about a potential rate hike. It is still his hope and expectation that this   matter can be resolved within the existing rate structure.\"   Some observers were incredulous, noting Davis' reputation as a micromanager   who keeps appointees on a short leash.   \"The PUC has been run like his personal cabinet for a year and a half,\" said   Gary Ackerman, director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a Menlo   Park-based association of electricity generators and traders. \"This one's got   me floored. The governor once again is a day late. The Oscars for best actor   were last night.\"   Confronted with teetering utilities, alternative energy companies that were   refusing to sell power in the state and state coffers bleeding by about $50   million a day, Lynch unveiled a set of four interwoven decisions that the   commission is scheduled to vote on today.   The measures would:   Raise consumer rates by 3 cents per kilowatt-hour, and make permanent a 1   cent temporary hike implemented in January. Before the January rate hike,   Pacific Gas & Electric Co. customers paid a 9.4 cents per kilowatt-hour for   electricity, 5.4 cents of which was earmarked for the utility's energy buys.   If the hike is approved, those figures will rise to 13.4 cents per   kilowatt-hour on average, 9.4 cents of which will be used for electricity   purchases.   Determine how much of that money will be used to reimburse the state   treasury, which has committed more than $4 billion to electricity purchases   since mid-January. Lynch said Monday that although the state has not yet   submitted data on its power buys, she believes the proposed rate hike will   fully reimburse state coffers.   Order the utilities to pay alternative energy companies, some of which have   shut down operations because they are not getting paid. The order would apply   to buys already under contract but not to the $1.5 billion that the utilities   owe for electricity already used.   Launch a PUC investigation into whether the utilities have improperly   sheltered profits in their holding companies and subsidiaries.   The proposals focus on the state's power buys and the utilities' upcoming   power purchases and do nothing to address directly the mountain of debt that   the utilities have accumulated. PG&E and Southern California Edison owe banks   and energy companies billions.   \"We're still going through the proposed decisions and would like to wait   until we have fully analyzed the material before we comment on it,\" said Ron   Low, a spokesman for PG&E.   By raising rates, state regulators would lessen the severity of blackouts   this summer but would probably not prevent them entirely, according to   industry groups.   \"In any circumstance, we're going to have a very difficult summer,\" said Jan   Smutny-Jones, director of the Independent Energy Producers Association. \"It's   too early to say how sufficient it is, but it (the commission's willingness   to raise rates) is an important recognition of reality.\"   Lynch acknowledged the measures will only partly address electricity   problems.   She called on federal regulators to impose regionwide caps on the wholesale   electricity market and order more refunds when prices have been unreasonably   high.   If the commission adopts the rate hike today, its next step will be to   determine who pays what portion.   Staff writer Matt Sebastian contributed to this story.

A rate hike won't in itself solve the state's electricity crisis, said Bruce   Kern, executive director of the Economic Development Alliance for Business in   Oakland. Reliability is the key business concern about electricity, and   restoring reliability will require more generating capacity and conservation   assistance for companies, he said.   Despite a surge in wholesale electricity costs since April 2000, California   regulators have allowed only a 9 percent increase in retail prices and Gov.   Gray Davis has adamantly rejected calls for further rate hikes. But Public   Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch, a Davis appointee, signaled   that the administration may be ready to retreat with a plan to hike the   average retail price by 3 cents a kilowatt hour. That would be a 46 percent   increase over the current average rate in the PG&E service area of 6.4 cents   a kilowatt hour, excluding distribution and other costs not directly related   to power procurement.   That didn't faze Allan Zaremberg, president of the California Chamber of   Commerce. \"We have looked at it as inevitable for some time,\" he said of the   rate hike. Higher natural gas costs, along with the dry winter that reduced   the availability of hydroelectric power throughout the West, were bound to   boost retail bills, he said.   Bradley, speaking for tech manufacturers, said Lynch's plan promises to stem   the tide of state agency spending on electricity, direct some revenue toward   small generators and put some downward pressure on wholesale prices but is   only one step toward a long-term solution. \"We need an overall philosophy and   strategy to restore normalcy to this market,\" he said.   Lynch, who described her offering as \"merely a proposal to jumpstart the   public process of rate design,\" included as a \"principle\" plans to narrow the   gap between residential rates and those of industrial users, whose average   bill now logs in at about 3 cents a kilowatt hour less. Lynch suggested that   that differential be shaved by about a penny an hour.   That isn't the direction that Kern would like to see things move. \"Our main   concern would be that if there is a rate increase it be (done) equitably and   not disproportionately affect business in this region,\" he said. \"We're   beginning to hear employers say, 'Maybe it's just too costly to do business   here,'\" he warned.   Higher electricity rates might force price increase and a cutback in   expansion plans at Helios Farms Nursery in Brentwood, which runs electric   water pumps for up to eight hours a day during the summer. \"It's too soon to   tell the affect\" of the rate increase, said Maria Orfanos, one of the owners.   \"We'll have to see what happens this summer. We need to water the plants.\"   But rate hikes promise to remove the cloud of debt -- billions of dollars   worth -- that now hovers over the utilities. The gap between high wholesale   prices and fixed retail rates cost PG&E as much as $4.1 billion in after-tax   profits during 2000, the company said in a securities filing Monday. But that   didn't seem to bother investors, whose heavy buying made California utilities   among the stock market's big gainers Monday. PG&E's stock closed at $13.75,   up $3.10 or 29.1 percent, and Edison International, Southern California's   largest electricity seller, closed at $14.55, up $3.35 or 29.9 percent.   Edison issued a late-day response to Lynch's move that seemed designed to   dampen investors' enthusiasm. \"A cursory review of the multiple complex   proposals suggests that substantial improvements will be needed if they are   to fully align costs with rates and restore the creditworthiness of the   state's utilities in the eyes of the financial community,\" it said. Edison   also called for the PUC to allow \"flexibility to meet unknown future shifts   in the costs of generation.\"   A PG&E spokesman said the company was still analyzing the \"inch-thick stack   of materials\" and had no comment. An earlier PUC proposal to require the   utility to pay small generators would leave the utility with \"insufficient   revenues ... to recover the cost of its own generation\" and to pay other   contracted generators, it said in its filing.   Kern, the EDAB chief, said he was encouraged by the state's plan to issue   industrial revenue bonds to finance stand-by generators for businesses and to   install energy-efficient lighting.

Some customers, including households that use little electricity, could be   spared entirely, while others, including some of the state's biggest   manufacturers, could see increases of close to 90 percent.   It would be the biggest rate increase in state history, and there is no   guarantee it would be enough to resolve California's electricity crisis,   state-funded ratepayer watchdogs said.   While Gov. Gray Davis sought to distance himself from the proposal, industry   observers said it stretched credulity to imagine his appointees to the state   Public Utilities Commission would have gone against his wishes.   \"Anyone who wants to claim this isn't part of his plan is going to fly in the   face of everything he's told us. It's just not likely,\" said Camden Collins,   a Bay Area energy consultant who has held high-level posts with the PUC and   the state grid operator.   After a weekend marathon of last-minute calculations, the PUC issued a   wide-ranging, sometimes contradictory package of proposals Monday for   probable commission votes today.   In one of the biggest conflicts, a PUC administrative judge who oversaw rate   hearings urged no increase at all, while commission President Loretta Lynch,   who leads a Davis-picked PUC majority, urged a hike of 3 cents per   kilowatt-hour.   Other key proposals include:   Making permanent a temporary 9 percent - 1 cent per kilowatt-hour - rate hike   imposed in January for customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern   California Edison.   Starting immediate discussions on designing rates that would fall hardest on   the heaviest users, changes that could appear in May electric bills.   Revising the formula for paying alternative power producers, known as   \"qualifying facilities,\" in a way that several said still wouldn't solve a   simmering payment dispute.   Creating a formula for utilities to pay the state for electricity purchases   made on their behalf since January, which appears to clear the way for the   state to issue power purchase bonds.   Reclassifying past debts and expenses to sharply cut utilities' estimates of   their losses - a move sought by consumer groups.   Consumer groups blasted the proposal, investors welcomed it, and utilities   were cautious, with PG&E declining immediate comment and Edison saying it   still didn't go far enough. Generators and economists labeled it a good first   step.   \"We have unfortunately come to the conclusion that a rate increase is   needed,\" Lynch said. \"It's time to pay the power bills for California.\"   Customers of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District would not be affected,   although it is considering its own 16 percent rate hike, also driven by   skyrocketing wholesale costs.   Lynch's proposal would let PG&E collect an extra $2.3 billion annually from   customers, increasing PG&E's system average rate from 10.4 to 13.4 cents a   kilowatt-hour. That comes on top of January's 1-cent average increase, for a   total rate hike this year of more than 40 percent.   But individual rates could play out very differently. Some people would   escape entirely, including those on special low-income rates and residential   customers whose electricity use falls below a state-set threshold. Companies   big enough to own their own substations could face hikes of 87 percent;   agricultural consumers, 10 percent to 24 percent; and other businesses, 41   percent to 58 percent.   \"Electricity hogs will have to pay more,\" Lynch said.   For his part, Davis told reporters in Los Angeles, \"As governor, I have not   decided there should be a rate increase, and as governor, I have not decided   that tiered pricing makes sense.\"   Although Davis has appointed three of the PUC's five commissioners, he said   \"I can't order or direct an independent body.\"   Davis' top staff members, however, have been in close communication with the   commission. Industrial groups indicated the governor's staff was discussing   nearly identical rate hikes last week.   Michael Shames, head of the San Diego-based Utility Consumers' Action   Network, said, \"This PUC doesn't do anything of this substance without the   governor's approval.\"   If they pass today, Lynch said, the new rate increases should be enough to   pay the qualifying facilities and the state for power that is produced or   purchased from now on. Still unresolved is whether additional rate hikes will   be needed to cover billions that utilities say they are owed for past   purchases.   Several executives of the qualifying facilities said the plan wouldn't pay   them enough.   \"I don't think it works,\" said Dean Vanech, president of Delta Power Co.,   which runs five gas-fired cogeneration plants in California. Four have been   closed because of lack of payment. \"We'd lose money marginally on every   kilowatt we produce,\" he said.   Still, many in the private sector saw Lynch's statement as a sign that   progress was being made.   Investors drove both utilities' shares up nearly 30 percent. Edison   International rose $3.35 to $14.55. PG&E Corp. was up $3.10 to $13.75.   Stephen Levy, senior economist with the Center for Continuing Study of the   California Economy, said he thinks the state can weather the rate increase.   \"Last year California absorbed a 50 percent increase in the cost of gasoline   with no appreciable effect,\" Levy said.   Although California's economy will slow this year, it will be the result of   the national malaise and the troubles in the technology sector, not energy   costs, Levy said.   But the top increases will hit hard at businesses, including \"cement, steel,   a lot of high tech, anybody in manufacturing,\" said Carolyn Kehrein, a   consultant to commercial power users. Some will flee the state, and many   others will either raise their own prices or cut back on salaries, she said.   In two hours of testimony before the PUC after the proposals were unveiled,   utility and consumer lawyers alternately praised and shredded them.   Noting utilities' last proposal was for a lower increase, Robert Finkelstein,   attorney for The Utility Reform Network, said, \"You're surpassing their   wildest dreams. That's very, very disturbing.\"   The Lynch plan relies heavily on a state bond offering to finance a major   portion of the Department of Water Resources' electricity purchases. In doing   so, \"we are borrowing against the future to pay the extremely high rates of   today,\" said Severin Borenstein of the University of California Energy   Institute in Berkeley. \"We're just paying it on an installment plan instead   of paying all right now.\"   But he said massive, immediate rate hikes could shock California into a   recession. \"We're doing a balancing act,\" he said.

Cox, of Fair Oaks, vowed to be more \"aggressive and proactive\" on energy   issues. He declined to comment on reports that his predecessor, Bill Campbell   of Villa Park, was dumped in part because he was working too closely with   Democrats.   \"We don't want to talk about individual personalities,\" Cox said when asked   why Campbell was replaced after less than five months in the leadership post.   \"We don't want to sensationalize it. It's a family matter. We'll handle it in   the family.\"   Cox, 63, who is the sixth Assembly Republican leader since late 1995, has   significant experience in the energy field. He served for four years on the   Sacramento Municipal Utility District's governing board, and later spent six   years as a Sacramento County supervisor before joining the Assembly in 1998.   Under his leadership, Cox said, Republicans will articulate an energy crisis   \"game plan\" and specific measures to help generate adequate power supplies by   2004.   Although Republicans hold only 29 seats in the 80-member Assembly, Cox said   that does not mean the party has no control over legislation.   \"You have as much power as you think you have,\" he said.   Privately, Assembly Republicans said Cox's selection was driven by a feeling   that they need to further distance themselves from Gov. Gray Davis' power   plans and by several key energy-related developments within the past week:   The Legislature is bracing to vote on separate bills that would provide   long-term contracts for alternative energy providers and would set the stage   for California to market billions in bonds to buy electricity in years to   come.   Both those votes require a two-thirds majority to take effect immediately,   meaning that at least five Republicans would have to join with Democrats in   supporting the measures. Republicans feel that situation gives them leverage,   and many want a tough leader negotiating on the party's behalf.   At a party caucus late last week, many Republicans were upset by the   Democrats' decision to place both key energy issues - and a third that would   extend an existing rate cap to large San Diego businesses - into a single   bill, AB 8x.   Assembly Republicans adamantly opposed that single-bill strategy but were   placed in an awkward political position - they could either swallow their   philosophical opposition or vote against the bill and take the blame if   blackouts resulted.   As Republicans debated the issue in tense party caucuses, Campbell commented   that he thought the Democrats' bill would pass. Opponents were livid. He   later said he did not support AB 8x and was simply providing \"cover\" for   colleagues who planned to vote \"yes.\"   Republicans ultimately voted as a bloc against AB 8x and demanded that all   three issues be considered in separate bills. Assembly leaders negotiated   throughout the weekend, but the issues remain unresolved.   During last week's tense party caucuses, Assemblyman Dennis Mountjoy,   R-Monrovia, reportedly criticized Campbell for leadership weaknesses.   Campbell lost his temper, adding momentum to a growing feeling of frustration   within the caucus, sources said.   Campbell said Monday that he doubts that the confrontation with Mountjoy   played a major role in his removal. \"That was just a case where things   happened and I apologized to Dennis. He said, 'It didn't bother me, I have a   thick skin.' \"   Asked if he had any regrets about his service as Republican leader, Campbell   said simply that he has enjoyed the post and did his best during the \"wild   ride\" of this year's energy crisis.   \"I'd like to still be the leader - but I'm not,\" he said.   Republican sources said opposition to Campbell's leadership has been growing   since January, when he voted to support AB 1x, which committed the state to   enter the power-buying market in a big way and spend billions for long-term   energy contracts.   Campbell, after seeing that he lacked support Monday, decided to step down   rather than spark a divisive fight to retain the post. Sources said Cox held   about twice as much support within the caucus as Campbell.   Ultimately, support from Republican conservatives led by Tony Strickland,   R-Thousand Oaks, provided the margin of victory for Cox.   The vote marked a turnabout for Strickland's group, which sided with Campbell   when he was elected over Cox in November.   Assemblyman Bill Leonard, R-San Bernardino, said it's too soon to tell   whether Monday's vote will leave Assembly Republicans deeply divided.   \"It could mean less unity, it could mean more,\" he said. \"It really depends   on Dave Cox's ability to pull the caucus together.\"   GOP political consultant Wayne Johnson said he thinks term limits were a   factor in the caucus' impatience with Campbell.   \"Everybody knows they're not here for very long, and when you're here during   what is becoming somewhat of a crisis environment, people want to be a little   more proactive,\" Johnson said.   Ray McNally, a Republican Party consultant, called Campbell an \"energy   casualty.\"   Under Cox, he said, Assembly Republicans will be \"more aggressive in   presenting alternatives,\" and Cox will \"work harder to show the differences   in approaches to solving the energy problem.\"   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------  Dan Walters: An absolutely incredible tale      (Published March 27, 2001)   From the onset of his governorship two-plus years ago, Gray Davis has   insisted, by both public words and private acts, that he and he alone would   make his administration's major policy decisions.   Legislators and lobbyists have complained that no one in Davis' office was   empowered to give an up or down signal on pending legislation, and   administration officials have recounted grimly - and very privately - tales   about Davis' insistence on deciding even minuscule policy matters. The   governor once castigated one of his Cabinet appointees before her colleagues   in the harshest possible language for making an environmental policy change   without his approval. The most routine action by a state agency is trumpeted   through the governor's media office. Davis has even joked about his   micromanagerial tendencies.   It is, therefore, utterly incredible - in the precise meaning of the word -   that Davis' handpicked president of the state Public Utilities Commission, a   former political adviser, would raise electric power rates by billions of   dollars without clearing it through Davis. Yet that's what the governor's   mouthpiece asserts.   On Monday, PUC President Loretta Lynch - acknowledging what anyone with half   a brain knew weeks ago - declared that power rates would have to jump   sharply. She is proposing an increase of three cents a kilowatt-hour, about   40 percent, in areas served by private utilities to cover the massive costs   associated with the current crisis, with a \"tiered\" structure to impose most   of the burden on high- volume power users.   Even Lynch was fudging, however, when she insisted that the boost - from   about seven cents a kilowatt-hour to 10 cents - would be \"all that is needed   going forward.\" In fact, as anyone who can do simple arithmetic can   calculate, it's only the beginning of a series of rate jumps that will be   needed to cover past debts and current wholesale costs. It's not improbable   that ultimately, rates will double (not counting another nickel a   kilowatt-hour that's imposed for delivery and other costs).   Lynch's public statement came just three days after Davis' aides briefed key   legislators on the likelihood of sharp rate boosts. Throughout, however,   Davis' spokesmen have insisted that the governor was not supporting such   increases and continues to believe that the supply and price crunches can be   handled \"within the existing rate structure,\" as one euphemistic version put   it.   The latest spin was issued by Davis' press secretary, Steve Maviglio, after   Lynch's statement. \"The governor has not had conversations with any (utility)   commissioners about a potential rate hike,\" the Maviglio statement said. \"It   is still his hope and expectation that this matter can be resolved within the   existing rate structure.\"   Clearly, the governor, who has been so insistent on doing things his way - a   tendency bordering on obsessive-compulsive behavior - has gone into the   bunker on this one, allowing Lynch to take the heat from consumer groups,   which immediately denounced the proposed rate increase as a giveaway to the   utilities.   It's cowardly, especially because the current crisis is largely a product of   dithering by Davis and Lynch last summer when the first price-supply problems   appeared. Had they acted forthrightly then, with such steps as long-term   supply contracts, it would have been a relatively minor bump rather than a   full-blown disaster that threatens the state's business climate and its   solvency and will cause financial pain for Californians.   If California needs a utility rate increase, so be it. But we Californians   would appreciate not being treated like children who need sugarcoating for   the bad-tasting medicine. And we'd also appreciate not having our   intelligence insulted with fairy tales from the Governor's Office.   DAN WALTERS' column appears daily, except Saturday. Mail: P.O.

Gray Davis' potential opponents wanted to invent an anecdote to use   against him when he runs for re-election next year, they couldn't do any   better than the one he handed them Friday.   While lawmakers desperately in need of leadership deadlocked on crucial   legislation to help solve California's energy crisis, Davis was at a Palm   Springs country club and golf course, raising money to add to his campaign   committee's already record-shattering $26 million bank balance.   The governor's spokesman assures us that Davis did not actually play golf   Friday. He merely stopped by the fund-raiser because he had some time to kill   between a morning groundbreaking ceremony and an afternoon television   interview.   Right. Davis may have been in Palm Springs on state business, but it's   curious that, wherever he goes, this governor always seems to find a way to   raise some money. Even if he didn't play golf, the incident drives home the   image of a governor so preoccupied with his own re-election that he can't   stay on-task in Sacramento to work on what is arguably the biggest crisis any   California politician has ever faced.   While Davis was rubbing shoulders with wealthy supporters in the desert, his   staff and some investment bankers were briefing lawmakers on just how bad the   energy crisis has become. The state may need to borrow $23 billion before   it's over, the bankers said, not the $10 billion that the governor has   publicly announced. And the idea of keeping the lights on without further   rate increases - a mantra to which Davis has clung against all reason - is a   fantasy. Rates will have to rise, perhaps double, to get us out of this,   according to the governor's staff. You cannot forever buy a dollar's worth of   power, they are saying, with 50 cents.   This is incredible stuff, especially coming from the governor's own people.   But what's even more astounding is that this news was delivered to the   Legislature, and thus the public, before Davis himself was fully briefed.   Davis is not only out of town, it turns out. He's out of touch. Of course, we   didn't need Friday's fund-raiser to figure that out.   Last week, to put it mildly, was a bad one for the governor, whom critics   have begun to call the prince of darkness. It began with two days of rolling   blackouts that would not have happened but for Davis' inattention to a   problem that threatened to shut down between 10 percent and 20 percent of the   state's already short power supply. Alternative energy producers, including   cogeneration plants that produce electricity as a byproduct of a   manufacturing operation, were going dark because they weren't getting paid   for their electricity and could no longer afford to buy the fuel that fires   their plants.   It has been widely known for months that the utilities weren't paying these   power producers. The Legislature has been working on a measure to get them   paid and lower their rates by roughly half. It's a very important part of any   comprehensive solution to the crisis. But after the blackouts hit, Davis   acted as if he'd only just discovered the problem. He was outraged. He said   it was \"immoral\" for the utilities to collect money from ratepayers and not   pay their suppliers.   But that was only the beginning. The battle over getting the small energy   producers paid led to questions about how the state would be paid for the   power purchases Davis has been making since January on behalf of the   utilities. Davis intends to float a bond measure - public borrowing - to   reimburse the state's general fund for the $4 billion-plus that the emergency   buys are costing taxpayers. The bond is supposed to be retired by dedicating   a share of future electricity rates to repayment. For the transaction to   work, the bond buyers insist on getting first call on the money collected by   the utilities.   The law Davis signed in January when he started buying the power was supposed   to put the state, and its bond partners, at the front of the line for the   utilities' cash. But the utilities, particularly Pacific Gas & Electric,   don't think the law does that. And Davis apparently failed to get their   signature on an IOU before he put taxpayers on the hook to save the companies   from bankruptcy.   These are rather large details to miss for a guy who has a reputation as a   control freak and a micromanager. But they are part of a pattern stretching   back to last summer, when Davis brushed off early warnings about the   potential depths of the crisis he was even then trying to avoid. More and   more he gives the impression of a man not so much trying to resolve the   energy crisis but of one who is thinking first, and foremost, about saving   his own political skin. The problem is, the more he focuses on his own   prospects, the worse they become.   It would be nice if Davis would suspend his political money-grubbing for a   few weeks and work full-time on the business he was elected to do. But then   again, maybe he should schedule even more fund-raisers: The way things are   going, come re-election time, he is going to need every penny he can get.

Even asking that question would have been laughable five years ago.   In 1996, California was heading toward a deregulated electricity market. The   commercial nuclear power industry was heading toward extinction.   No way could it compete with coal and natural gas fired plants in a   deregulated market. Never would a utility invest billions of dollars to build   a nuclear power plant when it had no guarantee of recovering that investment   through customer rates, which the architects of deregulation said would only   fall.   No one had ordered a nuclear power plant in this country since 1978, the year   before a partial meltdown at the Three Mile Island plant and eight years   before a nuclear reactor blew up at Chernobyl.   Political support for nuclear power was all but dead, and electric utilities   in the United States knew it.   That was then.   Today, the country's nuclear power industry is looking at California's   troubled experiment with electricity deregulation, environmental concerns   over global warming and an unyielding demand for electricity -- and they see   one thing:   Opportunity.   \"I'm extremely optimistic about the future of nuclear power in the U.S.,\"   Corbin A. McNeill, Jr., chairman and co-chief executive officer of utility   giant Exelon Corp., told the Irvine symposium.   Nuclear power advocates across the country say the industry is safer, more   efficient and more economically viable than ever before.   \"I personally believe there will be a new generation of nuclear power plants   in this country,\" said Ray Golden, a spokesman for Southern California   Edison's nuclear power plant at San Onofre. \"It's a function of when.\"   Late last month, Senate Republicans introduced an energy bill that could lead   to more nuclear power plants.   The National Energy Security Act, introduced by Sen. Frank Murkowski of   Alaska, would give a big boost to the industry. It would provide nearly $1   billion in research and development money, financial rewards for operators   who make nuclear power plants more efficient, and industrywide tax breaks.   Critics say the bill would just give taxpayer support to a dying industry.   \"Clamoring for new subsidies doesn't help the industry make the case that it   is now economically competitive and poised for a resurgence,\" said   Christopher Sherry, research director for the Safe Energy Communication   Council, a coalition of environmental groups founded after the 1979 accident   at Three Mile Island.  New lease on life  Two primary changes in the nuclear power industry have given advocates reason   to be optimistic.   First, commercial power plants have become more efficient.   The Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry-backed trade association in   Washington, estimates that improvements in output at the nation's 103   commercial nuclear reactors have added the equivalent of about 25 1,000   megawatt-reactors.   The industry, matured by decades of experience, has improved safety and   shortened routine shutdowns for refueling and maintenance. Electricity   production costs are at an all-time low, at 1.83 cents per kilowatt-hour   (down from 3.12 cents in 1987), making nuclear energy competitive with coal   and natural gas, according to the institute.   Second, the federal government has begun extending operating licenses for   nuclear reactors.   Since last March, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has extended the 40-year   operating licenses for five reactors an additional 20 years. The operators of   five more reactors have applied for license extensions, and an additional 28   are expected to seek extensions within the next five years, the institute   said.   Southern California Edison has not decided whether it will seek a license   extension for San Onofre's two remaining reactors, Units 2 and 3, Golden   said. Both are scheduled to be shut down in 2022.   In those reactors that obtain license extensions, utilities see new value,   and a profitable future.   Environmentalists see an avoidable danger.   Public Citizen, Ralph Nader's consumer advocate group, has called extending a   nuclear power plant's license a \"high-stakes gamble\" that risks safety in   aging plants.   Critical components in a nuclear power plant, including the reactor pressure   vessel that holds nuclear fuel and the thousands of steam generator tubes   that circulate heated and irradiated water, endure extreme stresses and   degrade over time.   \"There was a reason (the nation's nuclear power plants) originally had   40-year licenses,\" said Scott Denman, executive director of the Safe Energy   Communication Council.   New sales, new worries  With license extensions, nuclear power plants are now seen by buyers as   profit centers. Six commercial nuclear reactors have been sold since   mid-1999, and the sale of eight reactors is pending, according to the Nuclear   Energy Institute.   The merger of several big utilities has consolidated ownership of commercial   nuclear reactors. The marriage of Commonwealth Edison-Unicom in Illinois and   PECO Energy Co. in Pennsylvania in October created Exelon Corp. and placed 17   reactors under one corporate roof.   McNeill, of Exelon, said the consolidation is creating tremendous economies   of scale that are bringing down operating costs.   Critics worry about a new rivalry between utilities that operate the plants.   \"Electricity deregulation sets up a direct competition between power plants,   potentially compromising the safe operation of nuclear power plants as owners   attempt to minimize operation and maintenance costs while maximizing   electricity production and sales,\" Public Citizen has written.   The environmental group argues that a Feb. 3 electrical fire in the turbine   room of San Onofre's Unit 3 reactor, which occurred as workers were   re-starting the reactor after a routine refueling and maintenance outage,   shows that the industry is not as reliable as advocates would like the public   to believe. Damage caused by the failed circuit breaker that caused the fire   will keep the 1,100-megawatt reactor shut down through mid-May.   \"The NRC and the nuclear industry have been skimping on maintenance during   refueling to improve the profitability of nuclear reactors,\" said Public   Citizen's Jim Riccio, senior policy analyst for the group's Critical Mass   Energy and Environment Program.   Yet, according to reports the company filed Feb. 16 with the Securities and   Exchange Commission, Southern California Edison, the majority owner of the   San Onofre plant, will lose between $80 million and $100 million because of   the Feb. 3 fire.   That comes at a rough time for the cash-strapped utility.   The San Onofre nuclear power plant is the company's most important asset at a   time when it is near bankruptcy because of skyrocketing electricity costs   from out-of-state power generators.   \"San Onofre is the only thing that makes the company money,\" Golden said.  State's nuclear future  California, the most populous state in the country and the world's sixth   largest economy, has four nuclear reactors -- two at San Onofre and two at   the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant near San Luis Obispo. Yet, those four   nuclear reactors generate more than 4,000 megawatts of electricity, nearly 18   percent of the electricity generated in California.   A third plant, Rancho Seco, near Sacramento, was shut down in 1989 when   voters demanded its closure. Opponents said it was badly run.   Yet, so desperate are state legislators to find sources of power that at   least one has discussed turning Rancho Seco back on. On Feb. 22, state Sen.   Tom McClintock, R-Thousand Oaks, introduced a bill to study whether the state   should buy Rancho Seco.   McClintock said the plant could be put back into service in nine months for   $500 million. And, with new turbines, the plant could increase its production   of electricity from 800 megawatts to 1,100 megawatts -- enough power for more   than a million people.   McClintock acknowledges there is little enthusiasm in the state Legislature   for embracing nuclear energy as one answer to California's energy crisis.   \"Politically, they're scared to death of it,\" he said.   John. P. Holdren, a professor of environmental policy at Harvard's John F.   Kennedy School of Government, said the high cost of building nuclear power   plants likely will keep the industry from expanding in the short term.   In the longer term, though, Holdren said nuclear energy could offer a real   alternative to fossil fuels and thereby help combat global warming.   In testimony to Congress last June, he outlined several conditions that must   be met before the nuclear energy production can expand. Among them were some   high hurdles:   ?The industry must become competitive with other alternative energy sources   that do not emit carbon into the atmosphere, such as hydro-electric power.   ?Nuclear power plants around the world must prove they are safe.   ?The nation must find a permanent repository for nuclear waste and build   temporary storage facilities until one opens.   ?Research into reprocessing used nuclear fuel, which produces a form of   plutonium that could be used in nuclear weapons, should be suspended.   ?Nuclear energy must gain widespread public acceptance.   New breed   If any power company debuts the next generation of nuclear power plants in   the United States, it may very well be Exelon Corp.   The company is helping to finance research in South Africa into a new type of   nuclear reactor, called the \"pebble bed modular reactor.\" The 110-megawatt   reactor, about a tenth the size of conventional nuclear reactors in the   United States, would be designed to eliminate the risk of a meltdown, backers   say.   Passive safety features would eliminate the need for redundant back-up   systems, containment structures and off-site emergency plants, drastically   cutting costs. Because of their modular design, additional reactors could be   added at a single site. McNeill said the new technology could be imported to   the United States and Europe within the next few years.   \"A typical plant should be able to generate a kilowatt of electricity for   less than a penny,\" he said.   Environmental groups have been extremely critical of the design, saying that   it needs some type of containment structure, such as the concrete domes at   San Onofre, to keep radiation from escaping into the atmosphere should   disaster strike.   Meanwhile, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has approved three designs for   other, more conventional reactors.   McClintock said it's only a matter of time before politicians and the public   re-think their positions on nuclear energy.   The legislator predicts that a shift in opinions will come this summer, when   projections by the California Independent System Operator show that   electricity supply shortages will force blackouts on 6 million people.   \"By the time the state has survived the summer of 2001,\" McClintock said, \"as   a practical matter, we'll be forced to take a new look at nuclear energy.   .?.?. It is going to be a very ugly, ugly awakening for a lot of politicians   who sat around and did nothing.\"  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------      Top state power regulator proposes 40 percent rate increase           By Karen Gaudette  ASSOCIATED PRESS   March 26, 2001   SAN FRANCISCO  ) California's top power regulator proposed a 40 percent hike   in electricity rates Monday, saying such an increase should encourage   customers to cut back on usage and conserve enough power to get through the   hot summer months.   Loretta Lynch, president of the Public Utilities Commission, said rates   should increase by an average of 3 cents per kilowatt hour. The current rate   averages 7.5 cents per kilowatt hour.   The higher rates could go into effect as early as Tuesday, when the PUC   meets. Lynch and two other members of the five-member PUC were appointed by   Gov. Gray Davis, and Lynch's proposal is expected to be approved by the   commission.   Lynch, who repeatedly refused to characterize the hike as a 40 percent   increase, said the increase was needed to avoid significant power problems   this summer.   \"That number should be all that is needed going forward,\" she said at a news   conference, \"to keep utilities solvent and ensure that the treasurer of the   state can issue bonds.\"   Lynch's proposal is at odds with that of administrative law judge Christine   Walwyn, who recently advised the PUC that rate increases were not necessary.   Any increase would be on top of the 9 percent to 15 percent rate increase the   PUC approved in January, and an additional 10 percent increase already   scheduled for next year.   Lynch also supports a \"tiered\" rate system that would charge residential and   businesses customers more if they're large users and fail to cut back, a move   aimed at encouraging conservation.   The governor repeatedly has said he is confident the state's power crisis can   be resolved without further rate hikes. But Davis aides have concluded that   rates must rise, given that wholesale power costs remain high. Several   lawmakers, including Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, have said a rate   increase is inevitable.   \"It's obvious to me that unless you rob a bank or win a lottery you are not   going to be able to do this without raising rates,\" Senate President Pro Tem   John Burton, D-San Francisco, said Monday.   Southern California Edison Co. and Pacific Gas & Electric Co. both have   pushed for further rate increases, and PG&E has said its current rates would   be insufficient to cover its bills and the state's.   Administration officials have been negotiating with PG&E, Edison and San   Diego Gas & Electric about purchasing the utilities' transmission lines to   give the companies cash to pay their bills.   PG&E and Edison say they've lost more than $13 billion since last summer due   to high wholesale electricity costs that California's 1996 deregulation law   prevents them from collecting from their customers.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------      Supplier Duke offers to forego some charges           By Leslie Gornstein  ASSOCIATED PRESS   March 26, 2001   LOS ANGELES  ) A North Carolina energy supplier offered Monday to slice nearly   $20 million off California's emergency power bill for January and February if   its debtors agree to pay.   Under increasing pressure from state and federal regulators, Duke Energy   offered to forego part of what it charged for power during Stage 3 alerts in   January and February.   The power went to California's Independent System Operator, which runs 75   percent of the state's power grid, and to the now-defunct Power Exchange.   North Carolina-based Duke offered to drop $19.8 million in so-called \"credit   premiums,\" but only after the two entities agree to pay $273 per megawatt   hour for power supplied in January and $430 per megawatt hour in February.   ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson refused to comment on the offer.   Duke has not been paid for any power sent to California in January and   February, spokesman Tom Williams said Monday.   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said recently that $273 in January   and $430 in February were the highest rates that any supplier could charge   without triggering suspicion of gouging.   Williams would not say how often Duke's rates exceeded those caps during the   two months, nor would he say how many megawatt hours Duke sold to California   during the stretch.   But he did admit Duke often charged more than those rates. He called the   additional charges \"credit premiums\"  ) typical fees within the industry.   Suppliers often charge customers more if they have bad credit or suspect they   will be unable to pay.   FERC has said that Duke potentially owes California $21.14 million in   overcharges for the first two months of the year.   The company's offer was not meant to be an admission of price gouging,   Williams said.   \"We have not been paid a dime,\" Williams said. \"It is not unusual to have   credit premiums.\"   Duke, along with Reliant Energy Services, Dynegy Power Marketing Inc.,   Williams Energy Services Corp., Mirant and Portland General Electric, may   have overcharged California by as much as $125 million in January and   February, FERC has said.   Since the state's power crisis erupted, power at times has cost 15 to 20   times more than it did a year ago.   Before the energy crisis started, electricity was selling at an average   wholesale cost of $30 a megawatt hour.   The crisis stems from 1995 state laws attempting to deregulate the California   power market. The attempt has been criticized for sinking the utilities,   trapping them between state-mandated price caps and soaring electricity   prices on the open market.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------    PUC to Vote on Big Rate Hike; OK Is Likely     Electricity: Agency chief urges a boost of about 40% for many, and calls it   necessary to raise cash and encourage conservation. Higher cost could show up   in May bills.     By TIM REITERMAN and NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writers     ?????SAN FRANCISCO--Millions of Californians would see electricity rates rise   by about 40% under a plan presented Monday by the state's top power regulator.  ?????Loretta Lynch, president of California's Public Utilities Commission,   called rate hikes necessary both to raise cash and to encourage conservation.  ?????Her plan would charge some customers of the state's two biggest private   utilities 3 cents more per kilowatt-hour, depending on how much electricity   they consume. The higher cost would show up in May power bills.  ?????Lynch promised to target the increases on heavy users of electricity and   spare nearly half of residential customers from paying more. The commission   is scheduled to vote on her proposal today, and it is almost certain to win   approval, according to commissioners.   ?????It would cost customers of Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas &   Electric a total of $4.8 billion a year.   ?????San Diego Gas & Electric is not covered by the proposed rate hikes,   though officials there said their utility should be.  ?????Nor would the increases affect the customers of municipally owned   utilities in Los Angeles, Riverside, Pasadena, Anaheim and elsewhere.  ?????Lynch's proposal drew fire from consumer advocates, sighs of resignation   from lawmakers and enthusiasm from Wall Street. Stock prices for both   companies jumped by nearly one-third.  ?????For renters and homeowners, the proposal could cost nothing or as much   as 40% more per month. Business customers--who now pay lower rates--could see   even higher increases.  ?????The latest proposed increase would come on top of an average 10% rate   hike for all users imposed in January, which would become permanent under   Lynch's plan. An additional 10% increase for residential and small business   users is already scheduled for this time next year.  ?????\"We recognize the utilities are in severe financial distress,\" Lynch   said. \"For utilities to keep the lights on, we unfortunately came to the   conclusion a rate increase was needed.\"  ?????Commissioner Geoffrey Brown, recently appointed by Davis, predicted that   the plan will pass. Commissioner Richard Bilas, a Republican appointed by   former Gov. Pete Wilson, would not say whether he would vote for Lynch's   proposal but said \"rates need to go up.\"  ?????Davis, who named three of the five commissioners, distanced himself   Monday from the PUC action, saying that it's an independent body. He repeated   that it is his expectation that rate increases can be avoided.  ?????\"I've not seen enough information to persuade me we need a rate hike,\"   the governor said at a news conference after speaking to students at Walt   Disney Elementary School in Burbank.  ?????If the increase is approved today, Lynch said, it will be refined in the   30 days it takes the utilities to change their billing processes. The rate   increase would be subject to refund if it is more than enough to cover costs   of energy purchases.  ?????Lynch said she cannot finalize the proposal until she gets more   information about power supply and cost projections from the California   Department of Water Resources, which began buying electricity on behalf of   the nearly bankrupt utilities in mid-January. That's when some generators   refused to sell to the utilities for fear of not getting paid.    ?????Utilities Earned Substantial Profits  ?????The utilities have been burdened by wholesale electricity prices that   have topped 10 times the levels of those a year ago.  ?????Rising demand for electricity across the West, plus fundamental flaws in   the design of the deregulated market that California opened in 1998, have   allowed sellers of electricity to earn substantial profits. Since the state   stepped in to buy electricity for the utilities, it has spent about $3   billion covering roughly 34% of the state's power needs.  ?????While Davis has adamantly resisted rate hikes, other politicians have   come to call increases inevitable. The state and utilities need a better cash   flow to cover wholesale power costs expected to soar again this summer, they   say.  ?????And rate boosts will serve another critical purpose, they say, by   prompting Californians to switch off lights, buy efficient refrigerators and   shut down hot tubs. Such conservation will be crucial in whether the state   avoids blackouts, grid operators say.  ?????\"If it is tiered right, it wouldn't break my heart,\" Senate President   Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco) said, adding that he expects that any   increase will exempt low-income people.  ?????Lynch said repeatedly that the 3-cent-per-kilowatt-hour hike she   proposed should be all that is necessary to allow the state and utilities to   keep buying electricity. The more than $13 billion the utilities claim they   are owed for power purchases since May must be resolved through negotiations   between the governor's office and the utilities, she said.  ?????The Legislature already has approved a bill guaranteeing that those who   use 30% more than their minimal allocation, known as the baseline, won't feel   the hikes.  ?????The baseline is a certain amount of electricity--50% to 60% of the   average residential use per month--that varies regionally, so that a   homeowner in the desert has a higher baseline amount than one living on the   temperate coast. Electricity consumed up to the baseline amount costs less.  ?????Last year, Edison customers paid 6.2 cents per kilowatt-hour for   electricity. (The average home uses about 700 to 1,000 kilowatt-hours per   month.) The PUC raised that rate to 7.2 cents in January, and Lynch's   proposal would boost it to 10.2 cents.  ?????Edison customers also pay an additional 5.25 cents for distribution,   billing and other costs on top of the electricity charge.  ?????Lynch projects that under her plan about half of Edison's households   would have no monthly bill increases, one-fifth would have an 8% increase,   and fewer than about one-third of the households would have a 27% increase.  ?????Rather than welcome the potential rate hikes, Edison officials said they   were frustrated that the PUC proposal does not guarantee that the higher   rates will cover all of the utility's and the state's costs.  ?????\"It helps, but it doesn't solve the problem,\" said John R. Fielder, a   senior vice president at Edison. \"And it's really vulnerable because if it's   not enough, then what do you do?\"  ?????Fielder pointed out that when Edison argued for higher rates in   December, it was turned down, causing the utility to accumulate additional   billions in debt. Monday's PUC proposal treats that debt as a \"stranded   cost,\" which the utility could eventually be expected to absorb, he said.  ?????In a two-hour hearing on Lynch's proposal, PG&E lawyer Chris Warner   called it a \"a step in the right direction.\"  ?????\"We agree with President Lynch that it's time to pay the power bills,\"   he said. Warner declined to elaborate until the utility could study the   proposal further.  ?????Consumer groups immediately attacked the rate hike proposal.  ?????Jason Zeller, an attorney with the PUC's independent Office of Ratepayer   Advocates, complained that \"customers had no notice that they would be socked   with the largest rate increase in California history.\"  ?????\"My big concern . . . is it imposes massive increases, damages the   economy, and there is no guarantee it would do any good,\" Zeller said.  ?????Bob Finkelstein of the Utility Reform Network said: \"The focus [of the   PUC] should be to bring prices down, not rates up.\"  ?????Power sellers in California's market have \"an uncanny ability to sniff   out money,\" Finkelstein said, and the Lynch proposal \"only puts more on the   table.\"  ?????Lynch blamed the need for rate hikes on exorbitant prices for wholesale   electricity, noting that California paid $7.4 billion for electricity in all   of 1999, and $5.2 billion last January. She also blamed the Federal Energy   Regulatory Commission for failing to impose a cap on wholesale electricity   prices in California, despite its mandate under federal law to assure   citizens of \"just and reasonable\" prices.  ?????To plug the $3-billion hole in the state budget and pay for power in   coming months, lawmakers in February passed a law to sell roughly $10 billion   in revenue bonds. The bonds would be paid back with money collected by the   utilities from their customers.  ?????In recent weeks the utilities have argued that little or nothing is left   over after they subtract their own costs of producing and distributing power   from what they collect from monthly bills.  ?????But on Monday, Lynch issued a draft decision that would force the   utilities to send ratepayer revenue to the state based on a formula set by   the PUC.  ?????Representatives of both PG&E and Edison criticized that proposal at   Monday's hearing, saying it gave priority to the state Department of Water   Resources.  ?????Lynch also proposed forcing the utilities to begin paying hundreds of   small energy producers. Some of those renewable and alternative power   generators have not been paid since November. Many have shut down, and their   lost output contributed to rotating blackouts last week.  ?????The potential rate hikes were seen as lessening the possibility of   utility bankruptcy. That sent investors diving into the stocks of Edison   International, parent of Southern California Edison, and PG&E Corp, parent of   Pacific Gas & Electric Co.  ?????Edison rocketed $3.35, or 30%, to $14.55 while PG&E shares leaped $3.10,   or 29%, to $13.75. Both stocks have lost considerable value in recent weeks   as the electricity crisis dragged on with no solution.  ?????Investors were not discouraged by PG&E's warning that it might take a   $4.1-billion after-tax charge against 2000 earnings if it concludes that it   will not be able to collect its electricity debts through rates. Edison last   week said it might take a $2.7-billion after-tax charge when earnings are   posted, no later than April 15.  ---   ?????Reiterman reported from San Francisco, Vogel from Sacramento.

ACKERMAN      ?????As temperatures rise and the lights go out, let us recall the blessed   memory of Marx. Not Karl. Groucho. Well, not Groucho exactly, but instead the   other star of \"You Bet Your Life,\" his duck, which would descend from the   heavens with a cigar and a crisp $100 bill upon hearing a contestant utter   the secret word of the day.   ?????For Gov. Gray Davis, the magic word is \"votes,\" and he wants to offer   $100 bills to everyone, courtesy of the electric power sector. Davis will   discover during the long, hot summer that it won't work. While he and the   Legislature and the Public Utilities Commission and the Electricity Oversight   Board have had a grand time chasing each other around a room with whipped   cream pies and seltzer bottles, the economic and political risks faced by   producers have grown, the state budget reserve largely has gone poof! and   efforts both rhetorical and political to force other Western states to bail   California out predictably have come a cropper.   ?????And so the buck-passing season is in full bloom. Accordingly, we now   have studies from the Independent System Operator--the board of which was   appointed by Davis--purporting to show that recent prices charged by power   producers have exceeded costs, and thus have been unreasonable to the tune of   $6.3 billion, concluding that the current mess is all their fault, and that   everyone should get big refunds.   ?????Well. It all depends on what your definition of \"cost\" is. The ISO   analysis ignores the risks of nonpayment, now very real in the California   market, to the tune of $14 billion owed by the utilities, largely to power   producers and traders. The interest costs on late payment are ignored. The   ISO shunts aside the risks of unplanned outages of generating equipment,   necessitating the purchase of power in volatile spot markets. It ignores the   market value of investment in reliability, the political risks of   after-the-fact changes in the rules of the game, the risks posed by the   lawsuit industry, the risks of transmission breakdowns, the risks of rising   prices for natural gas and on and on. That a number of important costs faced   by power producers do not show up on the books does not mean that they are   not real.   ?????More fundamentally, the mere fact that prices are high does not   demonstrate that the market is noncompetitive. It is not costs that determine   prices in competitive markets, it is the relationship between cost and demand   conditions. Suppose sudden bad weather destroys a substantial part of the   wheat crop. The price of wheat will rise, despite the fact that costs as   measured by the accountants--the price of fuel and other inputs--will not   have increased at all.   ?????The ISO and others attempt to circumvent this simple reality by offering   exotic theories of market manipulation, in which producers withhold   electricity to drive prices up. This old argument fails to answer the crucial   question of which producer will withhold production. Each producer prefers   that his competitors withhold so that he can receive the benefits of higher   prices. An assumption that producers will take turns is not very helpful,   because their respective interests and expectations of future market   conditions are likely to differ. And anyway, where is the evidence?   ?????And so we are left with a call for regional price controls. Do   bureaucrats never learn? Price controls raise true prices, they exacerbate   demand/supply imbalances, and yet are beloved of politicians whose time   horizons extend only to the next election. The rest of us, unfortunately,   must live with the longer-term effects. Can anyone believe that confiscating   billions of dollars from the private sector will increase long-term   investment in electric generating capacity?   ?????The reality is that for nine months Davis has dallied, dithered and   engaged in demagoguery. Scapegoating now is the order of the day, as it sinks   in that no amount of talk will pull an electric rabbit out of a hat. It was   obvious last year that this problem largely would have been solved with a   moderate increase in electricity rates, combined with some straightforward   changes in regulatory policies.   ?????It is true that Davis did not create this problem, although his attempts   to blame prior Republican officials conveniently ignore the fact that the   Democrats held the Legislature when the current system was enacted. Oops. In   any event, it matters not one whit: We elect public leaders to lead when   unexpected problems arise.   ?????It would be nice if Davis were simply to level with Californians: There   is no painless route out of this mess, attempts to make scapegoats of the   producers are dishonest and destructive, and our regulatory system is   dysfunctional. Actually, that would be more than merely nice; it would be   uplifting.   - - -    Benjamin Zycher Is an Economist and Adjunct Fellow at the Claremont   Institute. E-mail: Bennyz@pacbell.net. Gary B.

Gray Davis' pledge that electricity bills will not go up,   state regulators yesterday proposed an across-the-board 40 percent rate   increase as part of a series of measures to remedy California's energy   crisis.   The immediate rate increase, to be voted on today by the Public Utilities   Commission, includes a new 30 percent increase and makes permanent a   \"temporary\" 10 percent average increase approved in January.   However, heavier electricity users would end up paying more than lighter   users under a so-called tiered system that could be enacted by May, PUC   President Loretta Lynch said.   \"It's time to pay the power bills for California,\" she said. \"We have   unfortunately come to the conclusion that a rate increase is needed.\"   Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, insisted that Davis played no   role in the decision to raise consumers' rates.   \"He has not signed off on this,\" Maviglio said. \"The PUC is an independent   body. It does what it wants.\"   However, Maviglio acknowledged that the PUC is controlled by Davis'   appointees and that the governor's staff was briefed in advance of   yesterday's announcement.   Lynch said she does not expect further rate increases this year. But she also   said the situation could change depending on current bailout negotiations   between the governor and near-bankrupt utilities as well as the state's   ability to recoup costs from its multibillion-dollar power purchases.   Harry Snyder, senior advocate for Consumers Union in San Francisco, said   there is no way state officials can avoid additional rate increases after   confronting sky-high electricity prices this summer.   \"It's a disaster,\" he said. \"By the end of summer, rates will go up by 100   percent. They have to because these new increases will barely pay back the   state for its power purchases.\"   Snyder also criticized the governor for having insisted that consumers would   not be saddled with paying the tab for the bungled deregulation of   California's power market.   Davis has said repeatedly in recent weeks that rates would not need to rise   beyond \"the existing rate structure,\" which many observers took to mean   January's 10 percent increase plus an additional 10 percent increase next   year.   \"It's the Nixon, trust-me school of government,\" Snyder said. \"How can we   take the governor at his word?\"   Because Lynch and other Democratic appointees hold a majority on the five-   member PUC, passage of the rate increase today is all but assured.   However, Lynch said consumers probably would not see the change reflected in   their bills until a tiered rate system can be introduced within 45 days.   Under that system, according to PUC figures, Pacific Gas and Electric Co.   customers who are light power users would see no change from current average   electricity bills of $60.   Medium users -- those who stay within 200 percent of pre-established limits   -- would see average bills rise by 9 percent to about $65. Heavy users would   see average bills jump by 36 percent to around $132.   Rate increases for customers of Southern California Edison would range from 8   percent for medium users to 27 percent for heavy users.   These increases would be on top of January's rate increases, which ranged   from 9 percent for residential customers to 15 percent for large industrial   users.   Investors saw this as manna from heaven for California's cash-strapped   utilities. PG&E's stock soared 29 percent yesterday to $13.75, while Edison's   shares climbed 30 percent $14.55.   The increase would generate about $2.5 billion a year for PG&E and $2.3   billion for Edison.   Yet many uncertainties remain. For example, the rate increase would not   affect about $13 billion in debt racked up by the utilities as a result of   runaway wholesale power prices.   That issue will be left for the governor to tackle in his bailout talks.   Maviglio, Davis' spokesman, said yesterday that the negotiations are making   progress, but he could not say whether a deal at last is taking shape.   ALTERNATIVE ENERGY PLANTS  Another wild card is the matter of alternative-energy providers, which have   cut back production in recent days because they no longer can pay their   natural gas bills.   The companies -- known as \"qualifying facilities\" or \"QFs\" in industry   parlance -- say they are owed millions of dollars by PG&E and Edison.   The PUC will vote today on forcing the utilities to pay the alternative   energy providers for all power received, but only on a forward-looking basis.   Past debt would not have to be paid right away.   It remains to be seen whether the qualifying facilities, half of which were   shut down during last week's blackouts, will be able to resume operations.   \"We cannot direct the gas suppliers to sell to them,\" admitted PUC member   Carl Wood.   The commission also is expected to vote today on requiring PG&E and Edison to   repay about $4 billion paid by the state Department of Water Resources to   purchase electricity for the utilities' customers.   However, it is not yet clear how revenue from ratepayers will be divvied up   in the future. The utilities and the Department of Water Resources are at   odds over which would get first crack at the funds to cover expenses.   BLAME GOES TO PROFITEERS  Lynch, the PUC president, laid blame for California's troubles on profit-   hungry power companies that she said have gouged the state's consumers, as   well as on a reluctance among federal regulators to limit how much generators   can charge for electricity.   \"The federal market cops need to get back on the beat because they're nowhere   to be found,\" she said.   A spokeswoman for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in Washington, D.   C., declined to comment.   Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility Reform Network in San   Francisco, questioned the wisdom of raising consumers' rates as long as   wholesale prices remain unchecked, especially going into a summer of expected   shortages.   \"Neither the commission nor the governor are willing to say no to the cartel   that is gouging us and extracting obscene profits,\" she said. \"Every time we   put a burden on ratepayers and ask them to dig deeper in their pockets,   the cartel smells money and moves in for the kill.\"   Lynch stressed that the burden on ratepayers would be eased under a tiered   system that she said would promote conservation.   'HOGS' WILL BE SLAUGHTERED   \"Electricity hogs will need to pay more,\" she said. \"If you want to run your   pool pump during peak hours this summer, you will pay for that.\"   Tiered rates have found support virtually across the spectrum, from the   governor's office to consumer watchdogs. The PUC is expected to have no   difficulty adopting such a system.   But Snyder at Consumers Union took issue with Lynch's characterization of   higher rates as a conservation tool.   \"That's total bull,\" he said. \"She's just trying to rationalize the increase   by saying it's all the consumer's fault.   \"The governor said there would be a sharing of pain,\" Snyder added. \"This   isn't sharing. This is nothing but pain for consumers.\"   The Agenda   Regulators will vote today on:   -- Immediately raising electricity rates 30 percent and making permanent a   \"temporary\" 10 percent rate increase adopted in January.   -- Forcing utilities to pay smaller power companies for their output. Half of   such generators were shut down during last week's blackouts because they   could not afford fuel.   -- Requiring utilities to reimburse the state Department of Water Resources   for $4 billion in power purchased on behalf of utility customers.

Gray Davis clung yesterday to his expectation that energy   rates won't have to go up and insisted that he didn't know one of his top   political appointees would propose a 40 percent increase.   Those comments drew shaking heads from many lawmakers, both Republicans and   Democrats, who believe that the governor was an active participant in the   plan announced by the head of the Public Utilities Commission.   \"I don't believe it,\" said Sen. Jackie Speier, D-Hillsborough. \"I think the   governor has been real clear from day one how he views everyone else in state   government. He certainly believes his appointees should reflect his vision.   I'd be very surprised if he isn't communicating. And if he isn't, he should   be. \"   Political observers say Davis may have thought he had found a political out   by having the commission -- which is accustomed to making unpopular decisions   - - take the lead on raising rates.   But the strategy could backfire as lawmakers from both parties say the   governor's refusal to acknowledge the necessity of rate increases -- a   position held by even his top advisers -- is making the energy crisis worse.   Pollster Mark DiCamillo of the Field Institute said Davis is making a   political calculation by keeping to his word on not needing rate increases.   \"I think it may be a public posture he wants to consistently maintain -- he   may not prevail -- but they may have to drag him kicking and screaming to   raise rates,\" DiCamillo said. \"But if his will is not carrying the day, he   may be seen as powerless and that could drag him down.\"   While PUC chairwoman Loretta Lynch announced that that rates will probably go   up 40 percent, Davis stayed far away from the firestorm enveloping the   Capitol, instead handing out academic performance bonuses at a school in   Southern California.   The governor has often tried to have it both ways with the PUC. Last week he   held a press conference to say he was going to direct the commission to act   on a plan to bail out alternative power generators. Yet yesterday a spokesman   insisted Davis knew nothing of Lynch's plans to propose a tiered rate   increase.   Davis has appointed three members of the PUC, giving his members a majority   on the five-member board.   But this isn't the first time Davis has tried to shy away from PUC decisions.   In December, when he had appointed just two members, he said, \"It doesn't   matter what I think. The PUC is the legal body that will make a determination   as to what, if any, rate increase is appropriate.\"   Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks, elected to his new   leadership role just yesterday, said Davis cannot run away from this rate   increase.   \"My guess is he has everything to do with it,\" Cox said. \"My guess is Ms.   Lynch at the PUC doesn't work independently of the governor.\"   But sources in the governor's office insisted that the governor had no   knowledge of Lynch's press conference. In fact, they said the governor was   frustrated by not knowing the announcement was coming.   Lawmakers could only shrug yesterday when told that the governor yesterday   said in written comments that it is his \"hope and expectation that this   matter can be resolved within the existing rate structure.\"   Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, the lower house's point man on the   energy crisis, called Davis' attempts to keep rates stable \"noble.\"   \"We are now past the time of pursuing noble goals -- we're at a time when it   is important to problem solve,\" he said. \"One of the tools absolutely   necessary to solve this problem is to raise rates. I don't like it, I don't   think there is anybody who does. But to continue now to maintain the fiction   that rates don't have to go up, will cause rates to go up more when they do   go up and will make it take longer to solve the problem.\"   Speier said she believes the problem is \"spiraling out of control.\"   \"It is a time to take bold steps, such as seizing assets,\" she said. \"This is   how leadership is tested.\"   Davis has taken pride in being cautious, but in an emergency that lack of   decisiveness could be his downfall.   \"As this goes on and the treasury is barren, he is going to be attacked for   other reasons,\" DiCamillo said. \"As other things get cut from the budget,   this will loom in the backdrop.\"   One advantage for Davis is that the PUC has often been a scapegoat for   unpopular regulatory decisions, DiCamillo said.   But on a day when Secretary of State Bill Jones became the first Republican   to announce that he will oppose Davis in 2002, GOP lawmakers grew bolder in   their criticism.   \"Regretably, I don't think the governor even today understands the magnitude   of the problem,\" Cox said. \"The governor has to be engaged.\"   Assemblyman Bill Leonard, R-San Bernardino, said ratepayers will be faced   with a \"Davis price surcharge.\"   \"The indecision, the lack of a plan for the last four months has resulted in   increased costs that have to be laid at the governor's door,\" he said.   Energy Crisis Jolting Sacramento What Gov. Gray Davis has said this year   about the possibility of rate increases: . After a plan for the state to   purchase electricity directly from power generators and sell it at cost to   cash-strapped utilities:   JAN. 14 -- \"There will be no rate increases.\"   After announcing that California would begin signing long-term contracts with   power generators at prices lower than those available on the open market:   FEB. 2 -- \"This will allow us to enter into and sign long-term contracts that   I believe will allow us to resolve our energy challenge without raising   rates.\"   FEB. 3 -- \"I believe we can get through this without the need for raising   rates,\" he said. \"But it's going to take a very substantial effort on the   part of every citizen. They will have to consume considerably less energy   than they did last summer. My office is so dark you can nearly develop film   in it.\"   FEB. 17 -- \"Believe me, if I wanted to raise rates I could have solved this   problem in 20 minutes. . . . It is my plan that all this can be done in the   existing rate structure.\"   FEB. 27 -- \"I have been telling people I think we are on the back side of the   crisis.\"   E-mail Lynda Gledhill at lgledhill@sfchronicle.com.   ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle ?

One of the biggest gripes people have about the outages is getting no advance   warning of outages that render everything plugged into a wall socket utterly   useless.   While many people say they understand blackouts are, for now, a fact of life,   they also want to know when the next one will roll through their   neighborhood.   Jillian Hom, an employee at a San Francisco branch of Baskin Robbins, said it   would sure come in handy to get advance notice of a power outage --   especially in the ice cream business.   \"It would give us time to cover up all the flavors of ice cream so they would   stay colder longer\" she said. \"It would also give us time to prepare because   we're not supposed to stay open during a blackout.\"   Although the utilities pull the plug, the decision to start a rolling   blackout is made in Folsom by the Independent System Operator, which manages   the state's massive power grid. The outages begin whenever California's   electricity reserves dip below 1.5 percent, threatening to bring the grid   crashing down.   ISO board member Carl Guardino thinks it might be time for the agency and the   utilities to begin warning people before cutting the juice. He plans to raise   the issue during Friday's board meeting.   Guardino could not be reached for comment but purportedly wants to balance   protecting the grid with allowing people to prepare for a blackout.   \"He understands the situation the ISO is in, and he understands that PG&E is   doing the best that it can,\" said Michelle Montague-Bruno, spokeswoman for   the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group -- which Guardino leads. \"He's   completely sympathetic to everything everyone is dealing with. But he also   thinks we have to do something to improve the system.\"   The inconvenience of a sudden outage goes far beyond missing your favorite   soap opera or even having the ice cream melt. Businesses lose money.   Researchers working with radioactive, infectious or corrosive materials face   grave risks. High-tech firms spend hours or even days recalibrating   equipment. The list goes on.   These hassles could be minimized, if not avoided, if PG&E would tell people   when and where the outages will strike, Montague-Bruno said.   \"The more warning they can give, the more we can prepare,\" she said.   Although the outages often come out of the blue, PG&E's 4.8 million customers   have a vague idea of when it's their turn in the rotation.   Customers are assigned to one of 14 blocks, and power is cut to each block   sequentially. Customers can determine which block they're in by looking at   the lower left corner of their bill.   \"If you're in block 14 and we're (cutting power) in block 4, you know you can   breathe fairly easily,\" said utility spokesman Scott Blakey. \"But if you're   in block 5, you know you can expect an outage.\"   But the blocks cover vast swatches of the state, and power can be cut to a   portion of each block. That leaves critics complaining that block numbers are   all but meaningless.   Brandie Spencer, a shift manager at the Pasta Pomodoro chain in Berkeley,   said the restaurant's accounting department deals with the power bills so she   has no clue what her block number is.   \"I have no idea when they plan to pull the plug on us,\" she said. \"But I do   know that it will be bad if it comes as a surprise in the middle of a busy   day.   We don't have back-up generators, so food orders won't be able to be filled,   cash registers won't work and I can't very well send customers home.\"   PG&E argues providing more specific information could jeopardize public   safety. It claims criminals would know which neighborhoods and businesses   aren't protected by burglar alarms, security cameras and the like.   But authorities in Palo Alto and Alameda -- two cities with municipal   utilities that actively tell customers where the next outage will strike and   roughly when it's coming -- haven't found any evidence supporting that view.   \"I can't think of a major increase in crime during the blackouts,\" said Agent   Jim Coffman, spokesman for the Palo Alto Police Department.   Others note that outages typically come during daylight hours, when criminals   are less likely to strike, or early in the evening, when most folks are home.   PG&E also argues there isn't time to alert millions of people to rolling   blackouts, which often start with just a few minutes notice from the ISO.   \"We often do not have any lead time,\" Blakey said. \"The last time we had   outages, (the ISO) lost two power plants just like that. Bing, bang, boom and   we were in the middle of a Stage 3 alert.\"   Municipal utilities also have a fraction of the customers that PG&E does,   which makes it far easier for them to notify people, Blakey said.   \"We have an average of 225,000 people in each block,\" he said.   That's about 10 times as many people as the Palo Alto Utility Department   serves. But municipal utilities said notifying customers isn't particularly   difficult -- or costly -- thanks to the Internet.   Alameda Power and Telecom spent about $20,000 creating a system using a   telephone hot line, e-mails and faxes to provide information to its 32,000   customers, said utility spokesman Matt McCabe. The information is available   within minutes of an ISO call for outages, he said.   \"It wasn't a tremendous expenditure of money, but it has been a lot of time,   \" McCabe said. \"But Alamedans have a very high expectation, and rightfully   so, that we should keep them apprised of the power situation. That's an   obligation that we have.\"   Chronicle staff writer Stacy Finz contributed to this report / E-mail Chuck   Squatriglia at csquatriglia@sfchronicle.com.   ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle ?

The California Public Utilities Commission's proposed rate increase comes on   top of a 9 percent ``temporary'' increase approved in January and despite   Gov. Gray Davis' promises to solve the state's crisis without higher rates.   Regulators plan to make that 9 percent increase permanent as well. The higher   rates would take effect immediately upon expected approval at today's meeting   and would appear on bills beginning in May.   ``We have unfortunately come to the conclusion that a rate increase is   needed,'' said Loretta Lynch, the commission's president. ``It's time to pay   the power bills for California.''   Under the tiered-rate proposal, more than half of residential customers would   see their bills jump by $6 to $47 a month. But energy misers and the poor   won't see any increase.   Industrial customers, who historically enjoyed lower rates than homeowners,   would see their bills soar more than 40 percent. Commercial customers would   pay 22 percent more than they do now.   Lynch described the plan as a way to encourage conservation and help avoid   blackouts this summer.   ``Electricity hogs will need to pay more for the energy they use this   summer,'' she said.   Davis, who appointed a majority of the utilities commissioners, including   Lynch, was said to be fuming over Monday's announcement.   ``It is still his hope and expectation that this matter can be resolved   within the existing rate structure,'' Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said.   Consumer advocates blasted the increase as a betrayal.   ``It's obviously a huge disappointment for consumers,'' said Robert   Finkelstein, an attorney for The Utility Reform Network.   ``Up to this time, the Davis administration and the PUC, in particular, had   made encouraging noises about getting the money out of the generators,''   Finkelstein said, referring to private companies charging high wholesale   rates for power. ``This draft decision seems to be an abandonment of that   position in favor of taking it out of the consumers' hides.''   But most state lawmakers have abandoned hope of avoiding higher consumer   rates. In recent weeks, they've seen negotiations to prop up the foundering   utilities stall and the administration's efforts to secure low-cost power   contracts fall far short of expectations.   Meanwhile, the state has been spending more than $1 billion a month buying   power for the major utilities, mostly on short-term markets, where prices   have risen eightfold.   ``I don't think anybody is fooled about the inevitability of a rate   increase,'' said Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco.   Assembly Speaker pro tem Fred Keeley, D-Santa Cruz, a central figure in the   state's efforts to resolve the crisis, called Davis' rate-increase resistance   a noble but unrealistic goal.   ``We are now past the time of pursuing noble goals,'' Keeley said. ``We are   at a time where it is important to problem-solve.''   Commissioners, who hastily drafted the rate increase over the weekend, said   it was needed to keep the major utilities from sinking into bankruptcy, which   they fear could unravel the state's electric system. Pacific Gas & Electric   Co. and Southern California Edison have been nearly bankrupted by soaring   wholesale power costs that aren't covered by their state-frozen rates.   Officials at PG&E and Southern California Edison were combing through the   PUC's rate-increase proposal Monday. PG&E declined to comment.   Commissioners blamed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for failing to   rein in wholesale power costs with price caps despite mounting evidence that   independent energy companies are gouging California consumers.   U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said a rate rise could ease approval of   legislation she is carrying that would force federal regulators to enact a   regional price cap.   ``There has been some resistance by members of Congress who feel the people   of California have not fully faced up to the energy crisis,'' said Feinstein   spokesman Howard Gantman.   The proposed rate increase of 3 cents per kilowatt-hour, along with the   1-cent increase in January, would push California residential rates over 15   cents, among the highest in the nation.   Rates will be based on how much electricity customers use. Power-pinching   residential consumers who use no more than 130 percent of their ``baseline''   allotment, an amount based on regional climate, would see no further rate   increase at all. Poor customers who qualify for rate assistance also would be   exempted.   But PG&E residential customers who exceed 130 percent of the baseline --   currently more than half -- would see their bills rise 9 to 36 percent.   State regulators said they needed to quickly boost the utilities' revenues   with higher rates to keep small energy producers from cutting off supplies.   Another concern was that the utilities haven't paid the California Department   of Water Resources for the power it has been buying since January for their   customers, draining billions from the state's general fund.   In approving the rate increase, regulators plan to order the utilities to pay   the small generators and the state for their ongoing power costs, and to   reimburse the state for its past purchases.   PG&E and Edison have received some $400 million in additional revenue from   the earlier rate increase and now have more than $4 billion in the bank,   regulators said.   Even so, regulators say utilities still face a cash-flow problem. The new   increase will add $4.8 billion to their annual revenues.   The commission, however, is ordering the utilities only to pay power   companies for ongoing costs. It does not address the $1.5 billion owed to the   small generators or the billions in debt to large power suppliers.   Lynch said no further rate increase should be necessary, and that consumers   could be refunded if investigations show they've been overcharged.

Davis' hard line against higher rates is fuel for challengers   Posted at 10:44 p.m. PST Monday, March 26, 2001   BY DION NISSENBAUM AND HALLYE JORDAN     Mercury News Sacramento Bureau       SACRAMENTO -- The political sharks are starting to circle Gov. Gray Davis as   the state's energy crisis threatens to drain the average Californian's   wallet.   With energy regulators -- most of them Davis appointees -- preparing today to   raise rates, opponents on his left and right are beginning to smell blood,   raising their hopes of making Davis the first one-term California governor in   more than 50 years.   Republican Secretary of State Bill Jones, sounding what is expected to be a   key theme, announced his long-expected plan Monday to challenge the   Democratic governor next year by accusing Davis of putting ``his head in the   sand'' during the energy crisis.   Consumer groups are vowing a ``ratepayer revolt'' and ballot measure that   could batter Davis during his re-election campaign.   And Davis is facing the growing possibility that a member of his own party   may view the governor as vulnerable enough to challenge him for the   Democratic nomination.   ``The political danger is in rates,'' said Mark DiCamillo, director of the   non-partisan Field Institute. ``That's when the political punch hits.   ``If the rates rise and the governor hasn't been able to hold them back, his   standing would start to crumble.''   For weeks, Davis has been expressing his ``hope and expectation'' that energy   bills wouldn't need to rise more than the 20 percent that's already been   approved. He has sought to portray himself as a staunch defender of the   average Californian.   Once again, Monday, even as his own political appointees to the Public   Utilities Commission were proposing immediate and stunning rate hikes, Davis   again expressed his ``hope and expectation'' that such a move would not be   necessary.   But as the crisis appears to worsen, there seem to be few people left,   including those on governor's own staff, who believe the problems can be   solved without asking Californians to pay more -- dramatically more -- for   power.   In some ways, Davis has painted himself into a corner much the way President   Bush hurt his 1992 re-election chances by breaking his ``no new taxes''   pledge.   Two options for Davis   Davis faces two options: oppose rate increases that nearly everyone else sees   as inevitable and take continuing hits for failing to lead, or reverse course   and face criticism for abandoning his longstanding opposition.   Either choice could hurt his political prospects -- both for governor and as   a potential presidential candidate in 2004.   In the Capitol, some lawmakers, Democrats included, are becoming increasingly   frustrated at his refusal to talk about raising rates and have begun to raise   questions about his leadership.   Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Santa Cruz, called the governor's stand against   rate increases ``a noble goal,'' but added, ``We are now past the time of   pursuing noble goals.''   ``One of the tools that will be absolutely necessary to solve this problem is   to raise rates,'' said Keeley, one of the Legislature's key energy   negotiators. ``To continue now to maintain the fiction that rates don't have   to go up will cause rates to go up more when they go up and will take longer   to solve the problem.''   Another senior Democratic lawmaker likened the governor's position to   President Lyndon B. Johnson during the Vietnam War when the violent morass   engulfed his administration, created a national crisis and pressured him to   abandon his 1968 re-election bid.   ``There will inevitably be people surfacing who will challenge the governor   from within the party,'' the lawmaker said.   Jones to challenge Davis   On Monday, Secretary of State Jones -- the only Republican in statewide   office -- said he would challenge Davis next year and used the energy crisis   as his major hammer.   Jones told reporters in Sacramento that Davis turned a blind eye to   skyrocketing energy costs in San Diego last summer, an early warning that   could have helped the state avert the electrical mess.   ``Instead, the governor chose not to have a bold, aggressive plan,'' Jones   said. ``He chose to basically put his head in the sand, and hope that the   problem would go away.''   But Davis still holds some commanding advantages. He has raised an   intimidating $26 million for his re-election campaign -- compared with   $118,000 for Jones. And he continues to receive strong support from   Californians in polls.   ``I think that one of the reasons that the governor's public standing has   remained favorable is because the average person out there clearly   understands that he has been fighting the good fight on behalf of   ratepayers,'' said Garry South, the governor's chief political consultant.   Even so, more and more lawmakers are urging Davis to take more decisive steps   to bring the crisis under control, which could undermine the image of Davis   as a methodical, but sure-footed chief executive.   ``I think the governor should peek out from behind the curtain'' and tell   Californians what he intends to do to solve the crisis, said Assemblywoman   Carole Migden, D-San Francisco.

And just how much money do   the power companies really need?   Oh, and Carol Wilson of Campbell has another. What more can be expected of   her and other residents who have significantly cut back on their energy usage   ``other than freezing to death or not cooking.''   Officials with the state's Public Utilities Commission say the proposed   average hike in residential electricity rates of more than 20 percent is   meant, in part, to encourage energy conservation and to avoid power problems   this summer.   But residents, who point out that they don't have money to burn, say they've   had no choice but to conserve energy anyway.   ``We're keeping use down to the best of our ability. My husband, Jerry, and I   sit home nights wearing jackets, huddled under blankets. We eat out more and   prepare more cold meals so we don't have to use our gas burners,'' said   Wilson, a retired director of medical records for Alexian Brothers Hospital   in San Jose. ``What's so maddening is we're doing things so our bill will   come down a bit, and then we look around and see so much waste from the   bigger users. For example, why don't they shut off some of the lighted signs   when their businesses aren't open?''   Jose Artellaga, a father of three who collects shopping carts for a Redwood   City supermarket, said he can weather the increase, but he worries about his   friends who wash dishes or flip burgers for a living.   ``For me it won't be hard, because I make a good salary,'' he said. ``But how   are they going to pay? It's a massacre.''   Artellaga said individual families shouldn't be the ones to pay higher rates   -- the businesses that consume most of the energy should.   Art Carey, a retired college instructor from Fremont, has installed   fluorescent rather incandescent bulbs in his home, lowered the thermostat,   and runs the swimming pool filter at night. But he said that conservation by   individual homeowners won't be enough to solve the energy shortfall problem,   and he worries that low-income families won't be able to absorb the cost   increases.   ``I'm still convinced that energy supplies are being manipulated by   out-of-state providers,'' he said. ``It's one of the principal reasons for   the price increase in gas and electricity.''   For Jessica Powers, a 22-year-old who moved to San Francisco from Ohio nine   months ago, a rate hike could have some practical effects.   ``It could be `no eating out Wednesday nights,'?'' said Powers, who described   herself as ``just scraping by'' financially.   Powers and her two roommates have been vigilant about keeping the lights off   and energy use to a minimum in their Lower Haight apartment, and she   acknowledged an increase would amount to a minor inconvenience.   ``But for the elderly, immigrants and low-income people, it will more   drastically change their lives,'' said Powers, a development assistant for   the San Francisco-based National Center For Lesbian Rights. ``That bothers   me.''

The current rate   averages 7.5 cents per kilowatt hour.\"  The PUC could vote as early as today to increase rates, with the effective   date as early as April 1. A rate hike of less than 40 percent also is   possible. Although Gov. Gray Davis continues publicly to oppose rate hikes,   Ms. Lynch is a close political associate of his and was appointed by him.   \"It's a move in the right direction,\" Robert Michaels, a professor of   economics at Cal State Fullerton, told us. But he said he didn't know how   much prices should go up because of uncertainty in other areas. \"Even in   Sacramento everybody is saying rates could double in a year. Nobody knows   what's being spent by the state on short-term energy. Or long-term energy. Or   knows all the unknowns of the long-term contracts\" the state signed earlier   this month.   A 40 percent rate increase also wouldn't cover \"all the things from the past   - the bills the utilities have to pay\" to the independent electricity   generators. But there is one positive aspect, he said: \"It will convince   consumers that there really is a scarcity in electricity.\"   Unfortunately, a rate increase could come in a politically manipulated form.   \"Gov. Gray Davis, faced with the near inevitability of raising consumers'   electricity bills, is leaning toward a rate system whereby those who use more   power pay more than those who conserve,\" reported the San Francisco   Chronicle. \"Sources close to the governor said he is being lobbied by his own   staff members to accept a so-called structured rate system.\"  \"I am a fan of restructuring rates to exempt conservation,\" Ms. Lynch told   the Chronicle. \"People who use a whole lot of power should pay more.\"  \"It's an idea we can use rates to redistribute wealth,\" Mr. Michaels said. He   also pointed out that the crisis really doesn't involve large, industrial   users, who use a mostly constant amount of electricity in their business and   manufacturing processes year-round. Rather, the problem mainly is with   residences, which comprise one-third of usage but which are the \"main users   of the peak time, the evening, when air conditioning is turned on.\"  Can't the state politicians look beyond the current crisis, for once? As the   state heads into a recession, do we really want to charge more to large   electricity users, such as businesses? And what if the many new Internet   \"server\" businesses can't cut power, just to name one industry? Businesses   would begin avoiding this state like a cow avoids an electric fence.  And what about people who stay home because they're retired, sick or for some   other reason? Should they pay more if they can't cut back? We don't charge   more for gasoline for people who drive 50 miles to work than for people who   drive 10 miles. Why should electricity be different?  Even as the state moves toward more rational pricing of electricity, the   mistake would be compounded by a rate structure that might be difficult to   dismantle as more power plants come on line and the crisis passes.  Finally, this crisis began with a flawed approach to free markets, misnamed   deregulation, and last fall deepened quickly as Gov. Davis and the   Legislature responded with every possible government solution that might   avoid the inevitable - higher electric rates. Now, the state faces the worst   of all possible worlds: a future with high electrcity prices, inadequate   power production particularly for summer, a massive debt for power bills owed   and a potential large deficit blown through what was once a state budget with   a surplus.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              Power rates may surge   PUC chief proposes a tiered structure that could raise costs for some   businesses and other big users by up to 36%.   March 27, 2001   By KATE BERRY  The Orange County Register   California's top electricity regulator Monday proposed a rate increase of as   much as 36 percent that would be shouldered primarily by businesses and   energy-guzzling consumers.   The plan by Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities   Commission, would attempt to solve part of the state's energy crisis by   raising electricity rates 3 cents per kilowatt-hour. The plan is expected to   be approved by the commission today.   The increase would later be subjected to a tiered-rate structure so that the   more consumers use, the more they would pay, Lynch said.   \"Electricity hogs will need to pay more for the energy they use this   summer,'' Lynch said at a news conference.   About 40 percent of residential customers would not be hit by any rate   increase, Lynch said, because their usage is 130 percent or less of   \"baseline,\" a subsistence level that varies regionally in the state.   Consumers who use between 130 percent and 200 percent of baseline would face   increases of as much as 9 percent, while those who use more than 200 percent   of baseline would pay the biggest increases.   Since January, the state has put itself in the precarious position of buying   power for the utilities at a rate of $45 million to $66 million a day - with   no mechanism to recoup the funds.   The rate increase would pay for the state's current and future power   purchases - which are estimated at $23 billion through 2002. It also would   cover power purchases from independent producers, known as qualifying   facilities, whose unwillingness to operate without being paid contributed to   last week's rolling blackouts.   The proposed rate increase would come on top of January's increase of 9   percent to 15 percent. An additional 10 percent increase is planned for next   year.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -------------------------------------------------------------------        Energy notebook   Senators struggle with PG&E rescue talks   March 27, 2001   Bloomberg News   SACRAMENTO PG&E Corp.'s negotiations with the state of California on a   financial rescue package are \"not encouraging\" and the state Senate is   consulting with bankruptcy lawyers, a top Democratic state senator said.   The Senate is discussing the possibility that PG&E and aides to Gov. Gray   Davis won't reach an agreement and creditors will force the state's largest   utility into bankruptcy, Senate Utilities Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen   said. The Legislature has renewed talks in the past week with lawyers on   potential responses to a bankruptcy filing, she said.   PG&E and Davis aides are negotiating the sale of the utilities' transmission   lines in return for billions to help them pay down more than $6 billion in   past debts. Those talks have so far failed to produce an agreement.   \"Much of what I've heard has not been encouraging\" Bowen told reporters   Monday. \"I've been working with utility bankruptcy counsel to make sure we   have a strategy for what to do if those talks fail.\"   PG&E declined to comment on the negotiations.   California has given PG&E a \"detailed offer\" and the utility has responded   with a list of questions, said Joseph Fichera, chief executive of New   York-based investment adviser Saber Partners LLC. Fichera is leading the   negotiations for Davis and the state.   The state is close to an agreement with Edison International, Fichera said.   Edison's Southern California Edison, the state's No. 2 investor-owned   utility, has already announced a framework agreement with the state to sell   its transmission lines for $2.76 billion.   Generator says it will lower price if assured payment   CHARLOTTE, N.C. Duke Energy Corp., responding to federal regulators'   accusations of overcharging in California, said it would take less money if   given guarantees of payment for the power it has sold.   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission accused Duke earlier this month of   overcharging California customers by $17.8 million during power shortages in   January and February. Duke says the prices were reasonable, given the high   risk that generators won't be paid, company spokesman Jeremy Dreier said.   California's Independent System Operator, which runs most of the state's   power grid, had accused generators of overcharging by $6.2 billion since May.   FERC has ordered Duke and other power generators to refund or justify $124   million in sales in January and February.   California's grid operator and the California Power Exchange, where most of   the state's power was once traded, have paid only \"a small percentage of the   amounts owed\" for past electricity purchases, Duke said in a statement.   Duke said Monday that, though its prices were reasonable, it's willing to   accept lower payments, provided it receives the rates FERC has deemed   acceptable.   \"We could be willing to forgo collection of the credit premiums for these   months, provided we receive the FERC\" price, Jim Donnell, president and chief   executive officer of Duke Energy North America, said in a statement. \"If we   are not assured of payment, the credit premiums are obviously appropriate,   and we would reserve our right to collect the entire amount.\"   FERC set a $273 a megawatt-hour limit on power sales to California during the   Stage 3 emergencies in January and February.       ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------        Resigned to higher rates   Business officials see little option, though product prices will likely go   up.   March 27, 2001   By KATE BERRY, JOHN HOWARD,   MARY ANN MILBOURN AND TONY SAAVEDRA  The Orange County Register   The proposal by California's top energy regulator Monday to raise electricity   rates will have a significant effect on companies, but business officials   said they see little alternative.   \"It just doesn't work when you charge a lower price for something that costs   more to produce,\" said Kathy Fairbanks, a spokeswoman for the 13,000-member   California Chamber of Commerce. \"We don't want the state of California to end   up the way PG&E and Southern California Edison ended up. In a perfect world,   this wouldn't happen. It's not a perfect world.\"   The proposal Monday by Loretta Lynch, the president of the California Public   Utilities Commission, for an electricity rate increase of 3 cents a   kilowatt-hour also marks a flip-flop by the Davis administration.   Gov. Gray Davis, who appointed Lynch, has been adamant that a plan to solve   the state's energy crisis could be worked out without raising consumer rates.   Lawmakers and energy-industry experts said the change of plan could backfire,   possibly damaging Davis' political career.   Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, said Davis had \"not had   conversations with any commissioners about a potential rate hike,\" adding   that \"it is his hope and expectation that this matter can be resolved within   the existing rate structure.\"   But lawmakers said the continued high cost of energy and the likelihood of   more blackouts created pressure for a rate increase.   \"Look at the numbers,'' said Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, D-Los Angeles.   \"When they started looking at this a couple of months ago, they had hoped to   do it without any rate increase. But the numbers are what they are. It's up   to the PUC to keep rates as low as possible.\"   Republicans believe Lynch is fronting for Davis, taking the political heat   for an increase Davis is loathe to endorse.   \"Make no mistake about it - this is a Davis rate hike,\" Assemblyman Bill   Campbell, R-Villa Park, said shortly before he was ousted Monday as the   Assembly's GOP leader.   Secretary of State Bill Jones, the state's lone Republican statewide   officeholder, announced his intention Monday to run for governor next year.   Jones has been sharply critical of Davis' handling of the state electricity   crisis, saying the governor passed up the chance last fall to buy cheaper   energy under long-term contracts.   \"He has done great damage to California in the past six months. He has been   focused on re-election, not policy, and that makes me mad,\" Jones said.   Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, said lawmakers have been talking   about a $23 billion bill to buy power for the state, which would require   rates to double.   \"That's what changed the landscape,\" Keeley said.   Sen. John Burton, D-San Francisco, was more blunt, saying it was clear   earlier that more money was needed to resolve the energy crisis.   \"It's obvious to me that unless you rob a bank or win a lottery, you are not   going to be able to do this without raising rates,\" he said.   Meanwhile, economists and business leaders seemed resigned to the need for   rates to rise.   Economist Tom Liezer of the University of California, Los Angeles, called the   plan another blow to business, but a minor one compared with wages and other   costs.   The bigger issue, he said, is the state's lack of generating capacity, which   may discourage businesses from locating in the state.   Energy supplies this summer are expected to fall short by 5,000 megawatts   during the midday peak, said Jack Stewart, president of the 800-member   California Manufacturers and Technology Association. He said the rate   increase \"will have a dire impact on many manufacturers.\"   \"You may see production shifting out of California or closing down,'' he   said. \"But something had to give.\"   Stewart forecast companies would have to pass on the rate increase to   consumers.   \"I don't know how consumer prices can help but go up,\" he said.   \"There's no question a 40 percent increase would have an impact on   businesses, but not doing it would have a greater impact,\" he said, pointing   to the uncertain power supply and utilities on the verge of bankruptcy.   Ron Danfield, energy manager at B. Braun Medical Inc. in Irvine, was   surprised by the proposed increase.   \"Oh, man,\" Danfield said. \"It's going to make our bottom line have some   problems. We've been trying to enact (energy) saving programs to offset the   costs we already have. So, how we (conserve more) will require us to be much   smarter than we already are.\"   Hans Biermann, owner of Hans Homemade Ice Cream in Santa Ana, isn't certain   what he's going to do.   \"I don't know how I can save electricity. If I turn the air conditioning   down, then my 17 freezers have to work harder,\" said Biermann, who currently   pays about $1,200 a month for electricity for his Bristol Avenue shop. \"We're   going to raise our prices a small amount and hope for the best.\"   Heino Nurmberg, owner of the two-man Estolith Printing Co. in Santa Ana, said   he doesn't expect to be hit by the rate increase because he uses so little   electricity. But he's concerned about placing the burden on the biggest   users.   \"If the big users that make the products really get hit hard, then everybody   gets hit because they will raise their prices,\" Nurmberg said.

Box 2579 Bismark, North Dakota 58502 senator@dorgan.senate.gov <mailto:senator@dorgan.senate.gov?subject='What Every Corporate Executive, Investor, And Citizen Should Know About Wall Street.'>     Dear Senator Dorgan,              Why Is Government Protecting The Real Thieves?   The sale of counterfeit securities is the vehicle for blatant thievery of Enron and other securities!              Evidence Of Counterfeiting:   The fact that short sold receipts are never issued by the represented public company; in simple terms, this means they are bogus, counterfeit receipts representing shares of legitimate stocks or bonds.   Falsified publicly reported data then helps to conceal the malicious scam.              Who Is Behind This Counterfeiting Operation:   How it's done, why it's done, and those protecting it may surprise many.   Remember, when the Public is buying the Thieves are selling opposite the public while often holding price down to sell even more ... especially when legitimate shares are not available.              Deliberately Engineered   economic hard times and bankruptcies are sure to follow.   The Thieves are not going to buy back their bogus receipts in a legitimate market ... they're protected and the laws are ignored as they share illicit fortunes via secret unaudited omnibus accounts.   It's all in US Congressional reports.

I few items worth mentioning -  1) Capex assumptions still seem too high for 2002-2004.  However, the 2002 number is some $30 million below the \"Dynegy transition\" capex amount shown in the 2002 Capex schedule.  Can we just assume non-discretionary only with the Base Gas repurchase in 2002/2003? Any discretionary would be commercially-driven. 2) Keep O&M flat to 2001 numbers? 3) Tracy / Shelley - Any thoughts on how to incorporate the contract info to better analyze the \"contract roll off\" scenarios? We have just assumed the 2002 Plan with 1-2% growth rate going forward with a new rate case in effect in 2005. Rod, not sure how you want to look at rate case assumptions or expansion opportunities but we can discuss tomorrow.  Recognizing the volume of NNG contract info and the time constraint we are under, there may or may not be any better alternative. 4) Rod - we have assumed an equity infusion of $175 million to re-capitalized NNG to more \"reasonable\" levels.  I can reduce the amount to $112,500,000 which is the Citibank prepay amount allocated to NNG if that sounds reasonable.  5) We will show a reduction in A/R of $1.807 billion and a corresponding reduction in equity due to the MCTJ loan.  Any thoughts you have on the above items would be very helpful.  We are trying to send out the info memo by the end of the week.  This model will be the basis for the NNG valuation.  Thanks, Kevin",

Before poor Stanley is needlessly tossed on fears of biological terrorism could you confirm whether Master Stanley might be in a brown envelope?  I didn't have Ms. Jung's email.  Hope all is well with you.  I am so pleased with how happy Chad is with school.  At first he expected to be  coddled like Kindergarten and complained that 1st grade was too hard.  Boy how things have changed in a month. Yesterday he told me that he was so happy that school was hard -- Kindergarten was soooooo boring.  I really appreciate the firm, yet compassionate manner you have with the kids.  It is just what Chad needs to develop.  While I'm writing, I will also mention one thing to you in case it comes up at school.  Over the summer we hosted a 4-year old orphan girl (Alina) from Kazakhstan.  She had to return to her orphanage while we complete paperwork to adopt her.  The other day, Chad was watching TV and saw a picture of some Afghan children.  He commented how much they look like Alina and then burst out in tears.  If the school works on a project for the Afghan kids, Chad may seem a little more emotional than usual -- just wanted you to know.  Regards,  Shelley Corman  (Chad's Mom) scorman@enron.com",

		"_body" : " I want to thank each of you for the role you played in maintaining operations and customer communications during the Internet outages we have experienced this week.     Having knowledgeable and dedicated staff to answer customer calls is always important, especially during periods of Internet and email outages.  Our customer teams and the HotTap helpdesk talked many customers through the process of using the offsite server and even manually entered nominations for customers.  Our gas control staff continued to effectively operate our systems despite having to handle an increased volume of calls from customers and while working in an environment without many of the normal reports.  The events of last week and this week added to an already long list of operational and systems challenges that we have faced this summer.  It has been a long and exhausting summer for our entire ETS logistics team and for our system support staff.  And, with a move ahead for much of our team, I realize that there are still added demands on everyone's plate.  As I salute all your efforts to date and your patience in the move ahead, I need to make a few additional requests of you:  1.  Please refrain from any non-essential Internet use.   As our team is connected back to Internet access, it is absolutely critical that we not re-infect company computers.  Please avoid use of any non-essential business sites, including news, shopping, financial, games, etc, whether at your desk or dialed in to company computers through VPN.  If you have a question about the appropriateness of a site, please consult with a team advisor.   Some groups may be disabled from Internet access altogether for the immediate term to ensure the reliability of critical systems.  This is a serious issue for Enron.  If our team re-infects company computers it will impact the long-term ability of our group to have Internet access.  2. Make sure that customer calls are answered.  The demands of system outages, testing and moving are weighing heavy on all of us.   I know that you have gone to great lengths to answer customer calls these last few days.  I need for you to continue that level of customer phone service.  Each customer team needs to ensure that customer calls are answered by a live representative and do not roll to phone mail.  This is the level of service that we have committed to deliver to our customers and we will have to find a way to keep this promise despite our move and other demands.  3. Smile and know that you are appreciated.  It seems like everywhere we turn these last few weeks we are confronted with bad news -- national events, Internet viruses, the stock market.   Perhaps it is trivial, but I wanted to make sure to tell you how much I appreciate what you do.  I feel proud to be part of this team and even prouder of the way that we pull together during tough times.  I also wanted to tell you that we are planning a fun celebration for our team in the near future -- details to follow soon.    Thank you   Shelley ",

Keeping watching www.houstonisd.org/bushes for when they post pictures of the event.  AWESOME VISIT On Friday, October 19, President George H. W. Bush and Barbara Bush visited our school. The Bushes had pledged to match the donation that our students made to the children of Afghanistan. Right in front of the entire student body, President Bush whipped out his checkbook and wrote a personal check for $1, 147.00! The children were very impressed! The day was fabulous, the weather could not have been better, and our children were stellar! The program took place on the stage in the interior courtyard of the school. Because the weather permitted us to use this area, every student was able to take part in the program and enjoy the excitement! As the President and Mrs. Bush entered the stage, the children waved paper dollars in the air to greet them. The program opened with the singing of the school song. Carmen Sullivan gave a history of the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag and Kelly Iko (this is our Kelly from Sunday School -- whom I'm sure will be the first minority President of the United States)  led the group in the Pledge. The students sang God Bless America and waved individual flags. Not an eye was dry! It was awesome. Maggie Strange, Julius Liu, Danny Siso and Brandi Shallenberger told the group about the effort the Bush students had put forth to collect money for the Afghan children. Doris Reese, Joan Zhang (this is a sweet little girl from Chad's class) , and Andrew Nelson wheeled in a red wagon with the students' contribution! The program closed with more flag waving and the singing of It's a Small World. ",

TW will have their morning meeting in EB1336 Mondy through Friday at 8:00 a.m. beginning, Monday, January 21, 2002. TW schedulers will attend this meeting. 2.  Gas Logistics will be sure either Steve January, Darrell Schoolcraft or Gary Spraggins is in attendance for Gas Control and either Lynn Blair, Terry Kowalke or John Buchanan is in attendance for scheduling discussions. 3.  On Fridays at 3:00 p.m., beginning Friday, January 18 , 2002, there will be a meeting in EB1336 to review any TW issues for the weekend.  Marketing and Gas Logistics will be in attendance. 4.  Beginning this weekend, Saturday, January 12, 2002,  on Saturday and Sunday, if there are any TW issues that need to be discuss, Gas Logistics will call the appropriate Marketing On Call person after the NNG 8:00 morning meeting. 5.  NNG will continue to have their Marketing/Gas Logistics morning meeting in EB42C2 Monday through Friday and the Conference call at 8:00 a.m. on Satruday and Sunday. 6.  The TW Schedulers will attend the meeting at EB1336 Monday through Friday.  On Saturday and Sunday, they will be in the NNG morning meeting conference call and stay on the line for the TW meeting if it is necessary to have one.  We are continuing to include the TW schedulers on the conference call due to discussions about system issues which impact both pipelines.   If anyone has any questions, or would like to discuss any changes, please let Kim Watson or I know and we can certainly look at other options.     I apologize this did not get started this last Friday, but I believe everyone has it on their calendars now.   Thanks for everyones help and support to come up with a solution that hopefully works for all.   Lynn    ",

But if you are communicating via email, what do you do? A handy solution is electronic business cards, called vCards (virtual business cards), which you can send and receive in e-mail using Outlook  Many other e-mail and personal information manager (PIM) applications can use vCards as well, not just Outlook. For more information on vCards, visit the Internet Mail Consortium at http://www.imc.org/pdi/vcardoverview.html Note: vCards are not needed when communicating with fellow employees, since we already have access to the Outlook address book and Peoplefinder.  Settings Up Your vCard  1)  Verify Your Information  - Open the address book ( )  - Find and select your name  - Double-click your name or click Properties  - Is your information correct and complete?  If not, update it in eHRonline or contact your HR rep.  2)  Create an AutoSignature with your vCard  - Close any open messages  - Click Tools, Options, Mail Format, Signature Picker  - Click New and then type \"vCard\" for the name  - Click Next and then click New vCard from Contact  - Find and select your name, then click Add ->, OK   - Under the vCard Options section, change it from <None> to your name  - Click OK, OK, Cancel  (make sure you click cancel or your vCard will be on every email you create) Good job!  Your vCard is setup and ready to go.   Sending an E-mail with your vCard    - Create a new e-mail  - Click Insert, Signature, vCard to insert your vCard   - Send your e-mail   Receiving a vCard via E-mail  If someone outside the company sends you a vCard, how do you quickly add it to your Contacts folder?   - Double-click on the vCard icon in the e-mail (this will bring up the new contact properties)  - Add any additional information you wish  - Click Save and Close  _________________________________________________________ If you'd like to reference past IT Weekly Tips,       double-click the following attachment and select Open It   To see general Windows 2000 and Outlook tips, click on the following link and then select Open It \\\\gtoma-dv01\\common\\win2000_training\\index.htm _________________________________________________________      <Embedded Picture (Metafile)>",

It looks like they're making it clear that they don't want an EISB developing wholesale electric standards.  They plan to be the single organization for developing these standards.  They've even added balanced voting for their committees.  I don't know the details, but they're using pieces of GISB's process that they know work and that people like.  Some GISB representatives have been making it look as if everyone in the energy industry is on board with EISB.  Clearly, they're not.  I'll let you know if I hear anything else.  Theresa   October 16, 2001  NERC Expands Role  At a watershed meeting today in Vancouver, BC, the North American Electric Reliability Council's (NERC) Board of Trustees took bold steps to expand its role for developing standards for the wholesale electric industry in North America.  Michehl R. Gent, NERC President and CEO, said, \"On the strength of strong recommendations from the NERC Stakeholders Committee, the Board pledged to take all necessary steps to become the single organization in North America to develop both reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards and to file such standards with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and appropriate government agencies in Canada.\"  \"NERC is committed,\" says Gent, \"to establishing a fair, open, balanced, and inclusive process for developing all standards.\"  NERC's Board approved a new process for developing standards and agreed to a new composition and weighted sector voting model for its standing committees.  NERC has long been recognized and respected as the industry's developer of standards for the reliable planning and operation of interconnected transmission systems throughout North America.  These standards have been the basis for the reliable operation of the bulk electric systems for over 30 years.  Richard Drouin, Chairman of NERC, stated, \"The Board of Trustees recognizes the urgent need for a single organization to develop both reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards that are well coordinated.  Such standards,\" Drouin added, \"are vital to support the evolution of competitive electricity markets, the formation of large regional transmission organizations, and continued reliability and security of interconnected transmission systems.\"  Today's actions are a major step toward formalizing a role that NERC has filled for some time.  NERC spearheaded the OASIS \"What\" and \"How\" Working Groups that developed the Standards and Communications Protocols followed by all transmission providers; formed a Market Interface Committee to address the impact of reliability standards on markets and the impact of market practices on reliability; and facilitates the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative, which recently filed a report with FERC on its efforts to develop common business practice standards for electronic scheduling (OASIS Phase II).  To accomplish its reinvention, NERC will actively solicit support from Canadian and U.S. government entities, and facilitate ? jointly with interested trade associations; federal, state, and provincial regulators; and other stakeholder organizations ? an open and inclusive process to achieve consensus on the details of its new role.  In parallel actions, the Board also took steps to ensure the independence of actions by its 21 Security Coordinators from any wholesale or retail merchant functions, and agreed to revamp the composition and voting structure of its standing committees.  For more information on NERC or its transformation into NAERO, visit NERC's web site (http://www.nerc.com/). The web site also includes information on the electric industry's electricity supply and delivery programs and activities.   *********************   NERC is a not-for-profit company formed as a result of the Northeast blackout in 1965 to promote the reliability of the bulk electric systems that serve North America. It works with all segments of the electric industry as well as customers to \"keep the lights on\" by developing and encouraging compliance with rules for the reliable operation of these systems. NERC comprises ten Regional Reliability Councils that account for virtually all the electricity supplied in the United States, Canada, and a portion of Baja California Norte, Mexico.      ",

As directed, the tariff sheets removed  the daily  high/low index price for cash-out.  In response, Texas Gas proposes to establish a cash-out price based on a weekly high/low index price determined from the weeks within the applicable month, plus the first week of the following month.  The primary and alternate sheets require in-kind make-up  of imbalances up to 2% and use the same index price  for  imbalances  above 5%. However,  the primary sheets also propose to eliminate cash-out for all imbalances up to  5%  by also requiring a mandatory in-kind make-up level from 2% to 5% and by eliminating any use of the 100% price index for this tier of imbalance.  Texas Gas states that copies of  the revised  tariff sheets are being mailed to Texas  Gas's  jurisdictional customers and interested state commissions.  Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Section 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations.  All such protests must be filed in accordance with Section 154.210 of the Commission's Regulations.  Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings.  Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. This filing may also be viewed on the web at http://www.ferc.gov using the \"RIMS\" link, select \"Docket#\" and follow the instructions  (call 202-208-2222 for assistance).  Comments, protests and interventions may be filed electronically via the Internet in lieu of paper.  See, 18 CFR 385.2001(a)(1)(iii) and the instructions on the Commission's web site under the \"e-Filing\" link.         David P. Boergers  Secretary   ",

With respect to the specific project listed:   1.  Gas Logistics is authorized to proceed with 4 Discretionary projects, including the three gas control network/security upgrades that you have listed and also the blanket desktop replacement project ($19,000) (omitted from your listing).  No further written proposal is required by Dynegy and restated capital budget will constitute the written authorization to proceed with these projects.     With respect to Footnote 2.  I believe the description below more precisely reflects our discussion:   2.  Dynegy requested and Enron agreed that NNG will not be charged any additional amounts for the Base Contract System through June 30, 2002, UNLESS Dynegy authorizes Enron to begin work on the customization and implementation of the NNG contract system prior to June 30, 2002.   To the extent that Enron is not directed to begin work on the customization of the base contract system for NNG prior to June 30, 2002, it is understood that the implementation date of the NNG contract system will be impacted.   3.  Dynegy requested and Enron agreed that NNG will not be charged any additional amounts for the Base Rates and Revenue System through June 30, 2002.       An additional footnote should be added to the page.   4.    The 2002 Capital Budget does not currently authorize the system modifications that will be necessary to implement NNG's Order 637 filing/revised filing provisions or GISB changes.   Dynegy and Enron will need to mutually agree whether to commence work on these modifications to meet filing commitments or expected FERC requirements.        -----Original Message----- From: Don.Vignaroli@dynegy.com [mailto:Don.Vignaroli@dynegy.com] Sent: Thursday, February 21, 2002 5:23 PM To: Len.Hesseltine@dynegy.com; John.O'Shea@dynegy.com; Dan.Dienstbier@dynegy.com; Carolyn.J.Stone@dynegy.com; Mary.Kay.Miller@dynegy.com; Dave.Neubauer@dynegy.com; Mike.Mcgowan@dynegy.com; Steve.Gilbert@dynegy.com; Keith.Petersen@dynegy.com; Lowry, Phil; Rice, Randy; Pribble, Dan; Nelson, Mike; Brassfield, Morris; Corman, Shelley; Hotte, Steve; Kleb, Steve; Concklin, Elaine Subject: Restated 2002 CAPEX Plan     Attached for your review and information is a copy of the Restated 2002 Capital Budget (25 page report) which reflects the planned CAPEX recently agreed to between NNG/Dynegy and Enron.

		"_body" : "Here is my two cents...  From your message I understand that the tree trunk is entirely on our property and branches  overhang the condominium fence.  If so, then the tree belongs to Ashford.    The condominium probably has the legal right to trim branches up to the property line, but may not go on our property or destroy the tree.    A landowner is generally not required to trim its tree unless it knows the tree to be dangerous or the tree is obstructing a public road.   A landowner can't be negligent unless they have legal duty to do something.  Since the condominiums concern appears to be aestetics and not safety, there doesn't appear to be a \"negligence\" issue. Further, a landowner isn't negligent for natural conditions such as a tree falling onto others property during a storm  unless the landowner knew the tree was unstable prior to the storm.    If the condominimum choose to sue the church for failure to maintain the tree, they would have to do so on a \"nuisance\" theory arguing that thetree interferes with the use and enjoyment of their property.  Still to prevail on a nuisance theory they would probably have to argue that the tree was dangerous.  Bottom Line:  We don't have a responsibility to trim the tree, but it seems sensible to let the condominium trim the tree so that issues don't ever arise later if a storm blew limbs down.",

		"_body" : "   -----Original Message----- From:  Howard, Kevin A.   Sent: Tuesday, February 12, 2002 10:35 AM To: Hayslett, Rod; Geaccone, Tracy; Chandler, Bob; Saunders, James; Corman, Shelley Cc: Desai, Jayshree Subject: NNG 10 year valuation model  I met with Jayshree Desai this morning to discuss the recommended changes to the NNG valuation model.  She will make these and circulate the model later today.  I few items worth mentioning -  1) Capex assumptions still seem too high for 2002-2004.  However, the 2002 number is some $30 million below the \"Dynegy transition\" capex amount shown in the 2002 Capex schedule.  Can we just assume non-discretionary only with the Base Gas repurchase in 2002/2003? Any discretionary would be commercially-driven. [Geaccone, Tracy]  The lower capital is probably from the revised plan.  I am okey with the other assumption.  2) Keep O&M flat to 2001 numbers? [Geaccone, Tracy]  Costs have been reduced due to Dynegy transition.  If we assume under our control, costs would be the same or slightly lower.  I would propose the same for now.  3) Tracy / Shelley - Any thoughts on how to incorporate the contract info to better analyze the \"contract roll off\" scenarios? We have just assumed the 2002 Plan with 1-2% growth rate going forward with a new rate case in effect in 2005. Rod, not sure how you want to look at rate case assumptions or expansion opportunities but we can discuss tomorrow.  Recognizing the volume of NNG contract info and the time constraint we are under, there may or may not be any better alternative. [Geaccone, Tracy]    I think this is a good assumption  4) Rod - we have assumed an equity infusion of $175 million to re-capitalized NNG to more \"reasonable\" levels.  I can reduce the amount to $112,500,000 which is the Citibank prepay amount allocated to NNG if that sounds reasonable.  5) We will show a reduction in A/R of $1.807 billion and a corresponding reduction in equity due to the MCTJ loan.  Any thoughts you have on the above items would be very helpful.  We are trying to send out the info memo by the end of the week.  This model will be the basis for the NNG valuation.  Thanks, Kevin",

The strident stance caught some state officials off guard and led one of Gov.   Gray Davis' advisers to label it \"negotiating in the paper.\" The two sides   have squared off for more than a month to try to hammer out an agreement that   would rescue PG&E from its mounting debt.   The company's resistance to plans that emerged this week in proposed   legislation and a prospective order to be considered Tuesday by the Public   Utilities Commission further complicates a difficult situation that appears   to be growing more tense by the day.   \"These actions approach the problem in a piecemeal and uncoordinated fashion   and would force us to pay out far more than we collect in rates, further   exacerbating an already precarious financial situation,\" said Gordon R.   Smith, president and chief executive of PG&E. \"The numbers just don't work.\"   Company spokesman John Nelson said he could not specify which options the   utility might pursue.   And while Smith promised to continue to work with state officials on a   solution, he said: \"We have a duty to our suppliers, lenders and shareholders   to protect the assets of the utility, and we must challenge any action by the   state to force us to pay out more than is collected in rates.\"   Creditors could petition to take Southern California Edison or PG&E into   bankruptcy at any moment, and some say their patience for a state solution is   wearing thin.   Lawmakers moved quickly this week to rescue the alternative generators, known   as qualifying facilities, after many shut down Monday and helped trigger two   days of rolling blackouts. The facilities range from geothermal operations   and wind turbines to natural gas-burning co-generation plants. They produce   about 30 percent of the state's energy needs this time of year.   The qualifying facilities quit running because they no longer had cash to pay   employees and buy goods to keep their plants operating. Southern California   Edison and PG&E have not paid the facilities for months, and they are owed   $1.5 billion.   A bill by Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Santa Cruz, sought to give the PUC   authority to order utility companies to pay the qualifying facilities in   advance. The measure also would direct utility companies to pay back the   Department of Water Resources, which has bought power for them since   mid-January, before paying back others.   The legislation passed the Senate but stalled in the Assembly, where   Republicans objected to the haste of the action, among other concerns. On   Friday, Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, said Democrats and   Republicans would work through the weekend to come up with a plan that could   win passage Monday.   Meanwhile, Smith said the approach contained in the legislation would make   PG&E's finances even worse. The company is collecting $400 million in bills   each month but owes $1.4 billion a month for energy purchases.   On Tuesday, Davis called PG&E's and Edison's practice of collecting bills   from their customers to pay the qualifying facilities and not forwarding the   money \"immoral.\" On Friday, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor   had nothing more to add.   Joseph Fichera, a member of the governor's team of advisers negotiating with   utility companies, said PG&E's refusal to fully pay qualifying facilities   leads the facilities to shut down, which in turn forces the state to find the   energy elsewhere.   \"They are still collecting and not paying out the full amount,\" Fichera said.   \"The consequences of that is that it increases the amount of power the state   has to buy on the spot market and creates a bigger problem for everybody.\"   Fichera said negotiations with Edison and PG&E would continue through the   weekend. He said there's nothing wrong with PG&E articulating its position,   but company officials have misjudged the plan and should keep in mind the PUC   will proceed on the qualifying facilities order in a way the company's   finances can work.   \"They need to get the QFs online,\" Fichera said. \"They need to see the bigger   picture that (having) the QFs offline is exacerbating a problem we call   summer.\"   Staff writer Mike Taugher contributed to this story.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------  A lone voice for price caps: U.S. regulator fears 'a disaster'  By David Whitney  Bee Washington Bureau   (Published March 24, 2001)   WASHINGTON -- William Massey used to be a team player. Then the lights   started flickering in California.   Now, Massey is the dissenting voice of the Federal Energy Regulatory   Commission -- a preacher, an absolute convert to the idea that free markets   be damned because California is getting a raw deal.   Wholesale electricity prices are rocketing into the stratosphere. Gov. Gray   Davis, joined by the governors of Oregon and Washington, is screaming for   price controls. And yet Massey said his colleagues wouldn't do their job to   ensure \"just and reasonable\" prices and rein in price gougers.   \"I fear a disaster is in the making,\" Massey told a House subcommittee this   week. He said that without price controls this summer, he fears the worst.   Massey isn't just pounding the table at congressional hearings. In recent   orders by the commission, he has been the lone naysayer, uttering in strong   terms the doom and gloom that will be thrust upon the state by an agency he   says is refusing to follow the Federal Power Act's mandate that it enforce   just and reasonable wholesale rates.   Two weeks ago, Massey condemned as insufficient the commission's order   finding that a dozen or so power producers may have overcharged California by   as much as $69 million for January power sales.   Massey called the commission action \"facially arbitrary, capricious and an   abuse of discretion.\" Massey said his colleagues only focused on power sales   above $273 a megawatt-hour sold during Stage 3 alerts of imminent rolling   blackouts.   \"There is no logic to this methodology other than limiting the universe of   potential refunds,\" Massey wrote.   Asked about this at the House hearing, Massey was even more pointed. When it   comes to ferreting out price gougers, Massey said the message is that \"FERC   is going to be looking for the wallet under the lamp post with the lights   shining, and nowhere else.\"   These are welcome words to beleaguered state officials and utility executives   who are growing increasingly frustrated that neither the commission nor the   Bush administration seems to be heeding the concerns of California and the   West over the worsening power situation.   \"Commissioner Massey has a very good understanding,\" said an appreciative   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, author of price-control legislation that Massey has   endorsed.   Joe Nipper, senior vice president of the American Public Power Association,   said the fact that Massey is alone in advocating firmer protection for   California and its consumers makes his role even more important.   \"Thank God he is there to articulate that point of view because if he   weren't, you wouldn't hear it at all,\" Nipper said.   Massey concedes that his role as commission dissenter is new. In his eight   years on the commission, the former legal services lawyer and aide to retired   Arkansas Democratic Sen. Dale Bumpers has been known more as a team player.   Nominated by President Clinton for the post in 1993, Massey was fully behind   the notion that free and open markets were the way to go in the energy   business.   When California's electric deregulation package started rolling through the   agency in 1996, Massey was right there, urging it on, proclaiming the glories   of open competition.   \"It's true that as the commission has marched toward competition in the open   markets, I've been there in a leadership role,\" Massey said during an   interview.   Several Midwest shortages during a 1998 heat wave were the first indications   that something was amiss. Massey said he was skeptical about the prevailing   view on the commission that the Midwest problem was the result of \"the   confluence of a series of circumstances that were unlikely to recur, the   so-called perfect storm.\"   \"I thought that was a naive statement,\" he said.   But Massey said this didn't shake his confidence in deregulation and   market-based competition so much as it caused him to doubt the commission's   ability to handle shifting circumstances.   \"The commission's attitude was that we couldn't go wrong, that competition   would always be better than the old-fashioned regulatory market and   essentially that any old market structure would work,\" he said. \"That is   simply not true.\"   Then came California.   \"I just feel like our actions have been too little, too late all along,\" he   said. \"As billions of dollars are changing hands, we were studying it. Then   we are investigating it,\" he said.   \"But for me, competitive markets have to produce just and reasonable prices.   A dysfunctional market that produces outrageous prices is unlawful. And I   think my agency has not taken strong enough steps to save California and the   West from a wildly dysfunctional electricity market.\"   Massey was on the commission when it basically rubber-stamped the California   deregulation plan, the first in the nation. He said it arrived as a package,   much of it written into state law, and that the agency did not ask hard   questions such as how California could get the best price for consumers by   relying on day-ahead power purchases on the volatile spot market.   \"Essentially we deferred to the market design that was handed to us,\" Massey   said. \"We did say that it was a work in progress, and that we would be paying   attention to it.   But to assume the spot markets would usually produce the lowest prices now,   in retrospect, seems naive. We are now very critical of that market design   but we did approve it.\"   Now the commission, with only three of its five seats filled, is led by the   panel's only Republican, Curt Hebert, who is adamantly opposed to price   controls.   The panel's other Democrat, Linda Breathitt, is similarly disposed.   \"I am the lone voice crying in the wilderness,\" Massey said.   But with the power crisis pushing up wholesale rates throughout the West,   Massey said this is not the time to be clinging to ideology.   \"I do not think it is worth bringing down the economy of an entire region of   the country just for the theoretical purity,\" he said.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------  March 24, 2001  California's Choices All Look Painful  By LAURA M. HOLSON  OS ANGELES, March 23  * California's energy crisis seems to get worse with   each passing day.  This week, Californians were once again plunged into darkness as warm weather   and a large number of shuttered power plants caused blackouts from Santa   Monica to San Francisco. In offices in and around Sacramento, frenzied   negotiators continue their months-long talks to design a settlement to keep   the nearly bankrupt utilities afloat and creditors at bay.  And despite a dizzying 190 bills introduced in the Legislature to address the   crisis, the bickering among politicians persists. Republican leaders have   called for the ouster of state utility officials, and California's controller   warned that the state's general fund was in danger of being frittered away   unless decisive action was taken.   Two months ago, Gov. Gray Davis promised a speedy end to the crisis. But all   the solutions proposed so far seem as fragile and tenuous as the grid itself.  Now a growing chorus of economists, business leaders and policy experts are   saying what most agree that Mr. Davis will not utter: the state cannot spend   its way out of this crisis, and politicians are delaying an inevitable,   albeit unpopular, end  * raising retail electricity rates significantly. The   desire to satisfy all parties is costly and has caused confusion and   indecision.  \"The solution to the policy problem is moving agonizingly slowly because   there are several powerful political groups that can block any piece of   legislation,\" said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a former chief economic adviser in   the Clinton White House who is now the dean of the Haas School of Business at   the University of California at Berkeley. \"California's politicians don't   seem to have enough power or conviction  * I think it's power  * to get these   groups to agree.\"   Further, said Steve Fleishman, a Merrill Lynch utility analyst in New York:   \"The government officials keep trying to plug the holes in the dam when they   spout up. But there are too many things that need to be paid within the   current utility rate structure.\"   In an interview today, Governor Davis reiterated what he has said for months:   California's biggest problem is short supply  * no major power plants have   been built in 10 years  * and he has invoked his emergency power to put more   generation online quickly. He warned, too, that state negotiators were   proceeding with caution to avoid the kind of mistakes the architects of   deregulation made in the first place. \"One of the reasons we are in trouble   today was because there was a rush to judgment,\" he said. \"We are not going   to make that mistake again.\"  But for a brief moment recently, it looked as if the state had finally   marshaled its forces and was well on its way to presenting Californians with   a cohesive plan. The state treasurer's office hired bankers to help sell a   $10 billion bond issue, the largest of its kind, that would help pay for   power now and stabilize prices over time.   State negotiators hoping to avoid a taxpayer bailout announced a preliminary   agreement with Southern California Edison to buy its transmission lines for   about $2.76 billion. And Governor Davis proudly told reporters that his team   had negotiated a successful round of long-term power contracts that would   help keep California's lights on.   But almost every promising announcement has had a less-enticing twist.   Intense negotiations with the privately-owned utilities drag on week after   week. Southern California Edison has not finished a deal to sell its   transmission lines, a necessity if it is to begin paying bills owed since   November. \"Progress has been made,\" said Bob Foster, Edison's chief   negotiator. But he warned, \"I don't want to sound overly optimistic.\"  Pacific Gas and Electric, for its part, has not announced anything, even in   principle. John Nelson, a spokesman for the utility, did not return calls   seeking comment.   Regarding the long-term power contracts, a report released this week says   that the state has received commitments for less than half the 6,000   megawatts it hopes to secure for this summer. The power generators, too, can   opt out of their contracts for a variety of reasons, including a failure by   the state to sell bonds by July 1. Governor Davis said today that in most   cases, much of the energy the state wanted to buy for this summer was no   longer available. That shortfall could require the state to buy more than 15   percent of the energy it needs in the expensive spot market, nearly triple   the amount he once said he wanted.   Still, the issue that has caused the biggest controversy is who has first   rights to the money now being collected from ratepayers. (Pacific Gas and   Electric and Southern California Edison now have $4.4 billion in their   coffers.) State officials have said that according to the law drafted in   January to ensure the state could buy power on behalf of the utilities, the   Department of Water Resources should be paid first. The utilities are saying   they are first in line. Whatever the outcome, the law's ambiguity has been a   problem for the state treasurer, Philip Angelides, who said it has not only   cost him precious time, but could put the bond offering in jeopardy unless it   is clear how the revenues will be divided.   \"The danger of this is if you let problems like this multiply, the situation   gets worse and worse,\" he said. California's Public Utilities Commission is   expected to rule on this issue. (Governor Davis said he expected the   commission to agree that the state should be paid first.)   But Mr. Angelides did not want to wait that long. Instead, he said, he and   his team approached legislators to write another law so he could proceed with   the state's $10 billion bond offering in May.   But even then, he contends, the bond offering is only a short-term fix at   best. \"After the $10 billion is exhausted, we can't keep borrowing and   borrowing and borrowing,\" Mr. Angelides said. \"The reality is our lack of   investment in power plants and inability to conserve are going to cost us   more.\"   Mr. Angelides has a point. But the governor's resistance to raising rates is   at best a negotiating tool. The governor has told some people that he is open   to raising rates, but only after the utilities make the concessions he wants,   people close to the negotiations with the utilities said. It is part of his   overall strategy, these people said  * one that includes building more power   plants and conserving energy, both crucial in helping California minimize   disasters this year and next.  But that does little to solve the problem of the $13 billion in debts the   utilities have already incurred. And that provides little comfort to the   likes of Hal Dittmer, president and owner of the Wellhead Electric Company, a   small power generation company in Sacramento, who decided to close down his   three power plants in February because he had not been paid all the money   owed by Pacific Gas and Electric. No solution now being discussed, he said,   either in the legislature or with the utilities themselves, really addresses   his problem. And like many of the utilities' creditors, he is growing   impatient.  \"The word I would use for what is going on in Sacramento is dithering,\" said   Jack Kyser, chief economist of the Los Angeles County Economic Development   Corporation, who has seen a swarm of recruiters from other states approach   Los Angeles businesses recently in an effort to woo them away. \"I think what   they have to understand is that they are putting California's economic future   at risk.\"   Governor Davis, while sympathetic to his critics' frustrations, dismisses   them. \"They are viewing the process from afar,\" he said. \"From the   government's perspective, we are moving at warp speed.\"  But that may not be fast enough. Today, in Sacramento, the State Assembly   rejected a plan that would have allowed smaller power generators, which have   contracts directly with the utilities, to be paid. Unlike their larger   counterparts, companies like Mr. Dittmer's do not have their sales guaranteed   by the state and are themselves threatened by bankruptcy.  The utilities have been negotiating with the smaller generators for months,   but industry analysts say the two groups are bitter rivals and no agreement   is likely soon. And to make matters even more precarious, smaller generators   could be the likeliest to force the utilities into involuntary bankruptcy, in   part, because they want their money and have the least to lose.  \"Politics is not just about keeping the lights on,\" Ms. Tyson said. \"It's   about making sure that all parties are represented.\" And that is contrary to   the business world, she added, \"where it's about getting the job done.\"  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------  Local generators win small victory  Filed: 03/24/2001   By VIC POLLARD, Californian Sacramento Bureau e-mail:   vpollard@bakersfield.com   SACRAMENTO -- With help from Kern County's three Assembly members, owners of   small natural gas-fired generating plants like those in Kern's oil fields won   a partial victory Friday in their campaign to get paid for the electricity   they sell to nearly bankrupt utilities.   Kern County lawmakers helped bury a bill that would have required the big   utilities to start paying the small generators -- but at a price below what   it costs them plants to operate.   The legislation is expected to be taken up in revised form Monday, and Kern's   lawmakers said they hope it will contain a better deal for the small   generators.   The action came at the end of a week of feverish activity sparked by rolling   blackouts that hit unexpectedly Monday and Tuesday. The blackouts were caused   partly by the shutdown of many small generating facilities because they have   not been paid for their electricity in months.   The crucial vote came late Thursday, when the Assembly's Republicans   unanimously opposed the low-price payment bill, depriving it of the   two-thirds vote needed for passage, in the face of heavy pressure from   Democratic legislative leaders. They wanted to push the bill through   Thursday, partly because most lawmakers were scheduled to leave Friday on an   annual lobbying trip to Washington, D.C.   No one felt the pressure more than Dean Florez of Shafter, the only Democrat   to vote against the measure.   \"It was really tough,\" Florez said Friday.   Assemblymen Roy Ashburn of Bakersfield and Phil Wyman of Tehachapi were among   the Republicans voting against the measure.   Florez and Ashburn said the main reason they voted no was that the bill would   have locked in a price for the small generating facilities that would have   made it impossible for the natural-gas fired plants, and many others, to keep   operating.   \"If they're losing money generating electricity, they're going to close   down,\" Ashburn said, adding to the state's shortage of electricity.   On Friday, after hours of closed-door meetings between Democratic and   Republican leaders and officials of Gov. Gray Davis' administration, Assembly   Speaker Robert Hertzberg announced that negotiations would continue and the   issue would come up again Monday.   The problem for local lawmakers was that the price established by the   governor's office, 7.9 cents per kilowatt hour for a five-year contract, is   anywhere from one-half to one-third of what it costs the gas-fired generators   to produce electricity because of the current high price of natural gas.   Under current law, the gas-fired generators are assured of a price for their   electricity that takes into account fluctuations in the price of natural gas.   Florez said the price being considered by the PUC would have made it   economical only for wind- and solar-powered generators.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------  Enron drops power project   The move surprises critics and supporters of a Lake Elsinore hydroelectric   plant.   By Thomas Buckley  The Press-Enterprise  LAKE ELSINORE  Enron North America has pulled the plug on its plans for a hydroelectric   power plant in Lake Elsinore.   Friday's surprise move does not kill the proposal but dims the hopes of   supporters like the Elsinore Valley Municipal Water District for the $450   million project.   But opponents, worried about power lines and the potential adverse effect on   the environment, were overjoyed.   \"That's fantastic,\" said Barbara Bowers, La Cresta resident and member of a   recently-empaneled project oversight citizen's committee. \"(Enron officials)   have finally discovered what we knew all along: This was not a viable   project.\"   While speculation about why Enron backed away from the proposal centered on   the instability of both the lake and state-power market, company officials   said their decision was a matter of timing.   Enron spokeswoman Kathy Russeth said the timetable for both the hydro plant   and the 23 miles of power lines that would have been strung along the   Elsinore Mountains ridgeline was moving much slower than expected, prompting   the company to re-allocate its resources to other projects in the state.   \"We need to pick up the pace with our power-plant development,\" Russeth said.   While the water district still holds a three-year preliminary federal permit   for a hydroelectric project and consultant Nevada Hydro has an agreement with   the water district, observers say chances are Enron's departure makes the   project impossible.   Nevada Hydro is expected to continue work on the project, Enron said, but no   one close to the project believes the water district and consulting firm can   pull it off alone. Attempts to contact Nevada Hydro officials were   unsuccessful.   \"If a company like Enron is not going ahead with this, it is unlikely the   project will ever be built,\" said county Supervisor Bob Buster.   But not everyone is willing to throw in the towel on the idea that has been   in play for a decade, has been declared dead before.   Dropping the project entirely is \"not an option,\" said water district board   President Kris Anderson.   \"We've got the permit and we've got three years to get the license to build,\"   Anderson said. \"I would hate to see the district get out now.\"   Distict officials will met next week to decide how to proceed.   Wildomar Chamber of Commerce President and citizen's committee member John   Purpura agreed.   \"It's a sad case and I hope EVMWD can find another company to step into   Enron's shoes,\" Purpura said.   In its latest incarnation, the pumped-storage proposal was born last summer   when Enron first showed an interest.   The water district was poised to cut its ties to Nevada Hydro, a consulting   firm long associated with trying to build project, when Enron said it might   be interested in pursuing the proposal.   In the following months, Enron, a multi-billion multi-national energy firm,   spent thousands on research and securing the preliminary federal permit for   the district.   People who lived near the lake where the power plant would go were irked by   what they saw as corporate heavy-handedness, while environmentalists and   forest residents became alarmed by power line and reservoir construction   plans.   The federal permit to pursue a final building license was secured in February   and the county-backed citizen's committee, after much controversy, had its   first meeting five days ago.   Backers have said the project would be a godsend to the lake, providing money   to buy water to keep it full and to help fund the upcoming $15 million lake   clean-up. Neither is likely to happen now, observers say.   \"All the expectations they raised have been dashed,\" said Buster, who sits on   the joint-powers agency in charge of the lake clean-up project. \"They owe the   community an explanation.\"   Environmentalist activist Gene Frick, who has fought the project for five   years and once promised to chain himself to an oak tree, was gleeful at   Enron's decision.   \"I thank you,\" Frick said, \"my associates thank you, and the oak trees thank   you.\"   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------  Jobs at utilities appear safe -- for now   PUC ruling offers some security at Edison and PG&E, but the threat of   bankruptcy hovers over many.   March 24, 2001   By CATRINE JOHANSSON  The Orange County Register   Safe for now, but for how long?   That's the question for thousands of employees at Southern California Edison   and Pacific Gas & Electric, which are near bankruptcy after paying billions   more for power over the past 10 months than they could charge customers.   The utilities hoped to save about $650 million by laying off some 3,000   employees, but a ruling last week by the state Public Utilities Commission   halted most of those plans.   Edison had planned to cut about 2,000 jobs during the course of a year. About   400 of them were cut in December, while the remaining 1,600 were to be cut   during 2001.   Shaun Rolow, a part-time Edison meter reader in Kern County, said he and his   co-workers feel their jobs are fairly safe, thanks to the PUC ruling, but   they worry about the future.   \"Most guys are very relieved, but we also talk a lot about the danger of   Edison going bankrupt,\" he said. \"We feel uneasy, but also try to joke about   it. Like when we get our paychecks, we joke about whether they'll be any   good.\"   The 400 employees let go in December were contract workers whose contracts   were up anyway, said Edison spokesman Steve Hansen. The PUC ruling does not   reinstate any of those workers. It does, however, prohibit further layoffs in   customer call centers, meter-reading departments, outage-response teams and   new-customer connection departments.   Exactly how many of the 1,600 other jobs are protected by the PUC ruling -   and how many are not - is unclear, as Edison officials haven't completed   their analysis of the ruling, Hansen said.   Of the 1,600, \"less than 50\" were laid off before last week's PUC ruling.   Whether any of those jobs will be reinstated remains to be decided.   Steven Carlton, a 20-year Edison employee who is an electricity foreman in   the Los Alamitos area, said a possible bankruptcy filing for the company is a   more immediate worry than layoffs.   \"We know that there are too few people to do what we do as it is, so we   wouldn't get laid off, but we do wonder what's going to happen in the future   if the company goes bankrupt,\" Carlton said.   The PUC also rejected the utilities' plans to cut expenses by reading   electricity meters every other month and using estimated bills for the   interim months.   Bimonthly meter readings would, according to the PUC ruling, \"create   inaccuracies in calculating baseline usage, and consumers will not be able to   see the results of their conservation efforts.\"   Although the PUC allowed the utilities to continue reducing overtime, Edison   has decided to pay for overtime work in some cases.   \"We continue to restrict overtime, except in cases where the public or   employee safety are compromised,\" Hansen said. He would not elaborate on what   kinds of situations those would be, but acknowledged that the company had   changed a strict no-overtime policy that left residents of an apartment   complex in Fountain Valley without electricity for a weekend in January.   \"If a community loses power, we'll send out people to fix it - even if it is   on the weekend,\" Hansen said.   The utilities can petition the PUC to change the ruling on layoffs, but   there's no word yet on whether they will do so.   \"We don't know yet, but we do expect the utilities to appeal,\" said Pat   Lavin, business manager for Local 47 of the International Brotherhood of   Electrical Workers, which represents 4,100 Edison workers.   The IBEW is one of the unions in the Coalition of California Utility   Employees, which filed the grievance with the PUC that prompted the ruling.   Lavin said the unions watch the situation closely and are prepared to   challenge future layoff plans by the utilities - regardless of whether the   targeted employees are union members.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------  State power regulator proposes 40% rate increase   Posted at 12:00 noon PST Monday, March 26, 2001   BY KAREN GAUDETTE     Associated Press Writer     SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- California's top power regulator proposed a 40 percent   hike in electricity rates Monday, saying such an increase should encourage   customers to cut back on usage and conserve enough power to get through the   hot summer months.   Loretta Lynch, president of the Public Utilities Commission, said rates   should increase by an average of 3 cents per kilowatt hour. The current rate   averages 7.5 cents per kilowatt hour.   The higher rates could go into effect as early as Tuesday, when the PUC   meets. Lynch and two other members of the five-member PUC were appointed by   Gov. Gray Davis, and Lynch's proposal is expected to be approved by the   commission.   Lynch, who repeatedly refused to characterize the hike as a 40 percent   increase, said the increase was needed to avoid significant power problems   this summer.   ``That number should be all that is needed going forward,'' she said at a   news conference, ``to keep utilities solvent and ensure that the treasurer of   the state can issue bonds.''   Lynch's proposal is at odds with that of administrative law judge Christine   Walwyn, who recently advised the PUC that rate increases were not necessary.   Any increase would be on top of the 9 percent to 15 percent rate increase the   PUC approved in January, and an additional 10 percent increase already   scheduled for next year.   Lynch also supports a ``tiered'' rate system that would charge residential   and businesses customers more if they're large users and fail to cut back. So   it should encourage conservation.   The governor repeatedly has said he is confident the state's power crisis can   be resolved without further rate hikes. But Davis aides have concluded that   rates must rise, given that wholesale power costs remain high. Several   lawmakers, including Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, have said a rate   increase is inevitable.   Southern California Edison Co. and Pacific Gas & Electric Co. both have   pushed for further rate increases, and PG&E has said its current rates would   be insufficient to cover its bills and the state's.   Administration officials have been negotiating with PG&E, Edison and San   Diego Gas & Electric about purchasing the utilities' transmission lines to   give the companies cash to pay their bills.   PG&E and Edison say they've lost more than $13 billion since last summer due   to high wholesale electricity costs that California's 1996 deregulation law   prevents them from collecting from their customers.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------  Calif State Treasurer: Electricity Rate Hike Inevitable    03/26/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service  (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)    NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The State of California will have to raise electricity   rates for consumers to reflect the dramatic price rise seen in the wholesale   power market, State Treasurer Phil Angelides said Monday in an interview on   CNBC.   Angelides declined to specify how much rates would rise from current levels,   however, and he said that the state's two main investor-owned utilities might   possibly have to reorganize their financial situation through a bankruptcy   proceeding.  \"It's hard to tell,\" what the percentage of the increase would be, Angelides   said, \"but there's no mystery that rates are going up. We have to match the   price of power to what we pay for it to keep the lights on.\"   The rate increase would both curb demand and assure lenders that the state   will be able to repay the $10 billion in bonds it wants to issue to cover the   costs of purchasing power.   As for the utilities, \"It's their job to reorganize themselves inside or   outside of a bankruptcy proceeding,\" Angelides said, adding that the   utilities' parent companies greatly benefitted from electric deregulation for   three years before suffering huge losses in 2000.   Since the state began buying power on behalf of its two near-bankrupt   utilities - PG&E Corp.'s (PCG) Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Edison   International's (EIX) Southern California Edison - in January, it has spent   almost $3 billion covering the difference between the utilities' generated   power and their customers' electricity usage.   Angelides spoke from New York, where he is trying to convince Wall Street   bankers to help issue the $10 billion in bonds. The debt issue will provide   \"breathing room to get to a long-term plan by September to balance market   prices and rates,\" he said. The money will also be used for \"a very dramatic   conservation program.\"   \"If we can get demand down 5% to 10%, we can get power prices down,\"   Angelides said.   But the treasurer also said that the merchant power companies in the state   have acted unconscionably. Reducing demand, he said, will put the state in a   better position to get the producers to negotiate reasonable long-term prices   as part of a sustainable solution to the state's power and financial crisis.   \"The first problem is a supply and demand imbalance. If we in California deny   that we're denying reality. But the other problem is that generators have   been charging unfair and unreasonably prices,\" said Angelides, who said   generators have to \"take their foot off our throat and meet us half-way.\"   -By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604; mark.golden@dowjones.com  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------  Possible rate hikes cheer California utility investors   MICHAEL LIEDTKE, AP Business Writer  Monday, March 26, 2001   ,2001 Associated Press   (03-26) 11:46 PST SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The prospect of substantially higher   electricity rates in California drew rave reviews Monday on Wall Street as   investors snapped up the long-suffering stocks of the state's two largest   utilities.   With about two hours of trading left on the New York Stock Exchange, shares   in PG&E Corp. surged $3.80, or 36 percent, to $14.45 while Edison   International's stock gained $3.79, or 34 percent, to $14.99.   San Francisco-based PG&E and Rosemead-based Edison International own   utilities that have been flirting with bankruptcy for months as they paid for   soaring wholesale electricity costs that couldn't be passed on to customers   under the state's deregulation law.   After months of resistance to the idea, state political leaders and   regulators are poised to swallow a bitter pill and prescribe significant new   rate increases.   California's top power regulator proposed a 40 percent hike in electricity   rates Monday, saying such an increase should encourage customers to cut back   on usage and conserve enough power to get through the hot summer months.   Loretta Lynch, president of the Public Utilities Commission, said rates   should increase by an average of 3 cents per kilowatt hour. The current rate   averages 7.5 cents per kilowatt hour. The higher rates could go into effect   as early as Tuesday, when the PUC meets.   Gov. Gray Davis remains confident the state's power crisis can be resolved   without further rate hikes, an aide said Monday. But his high-level financial   aides warned legislative leaders Friday that consumers could feel significant   pain when all is said and done.   Although nothing has been completed, news of the likely rate increases leaked   out during the weekend and raised hopes on Wall Street that the darkest days   for the two utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California   Edison, might be behind them.   The utilities' executives, backed by numerous industry analysts, have   contended for months that the state needed to approve hefty rate increases to   ease a power crisis that threatens to make rolling blackouts a routine event   this summer.   The higher rates are seen as a way to ease the financial burden of the   utilities, which say they have run up debts of more than $13 billion buying   wholesale electricity during the last 10 months. Analysts also reason higher   electricity bills will persuade more customers to reduce their usage and   reduce the frequency of blackouts this summer.   The likely rate increases weren't the only good news for utility shareholders   Monday.   Over the weekend, Southern California Edison said it will resume payments to   alternative energy providers known as ``qualifying facilities'' -- a move   expected to reduce the chances that the disgruntled generators will band   together and try to force the utility into bankruptcy.   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Monday, Pacific Gas and   Electric disclosed that it had received more breathing room from some of its   key creditors. The utility has defaulted on a $1 billion revolving credit   line, but the banks that made the loans have given the company until April 13   to work things out, the filing said.   PG&E also revealed that its electricity losses could result in a $4.1 billion   charge against its fourth-quarter earnings.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------------------  Duke says would take less for California power sales   Posted at 11:55 a.m. PST Monday, March 26, 2001   NEW YORK, (Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp. said Monday it would take less money   for power it sold to California customers during January and February,   provided it receives guarantees it will get paid.   Responding to accusations by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)   that it overcharged its California customers by $17.8 million during power   shortages in January and February, Duke said in a statement that the prices   it charged were ''reasonable'' given the high risks that generators would not   be paid.   In a filing with FERC Friday, Duke President and Chief Executive Officer Jim   Donnell said, ``We could be willing to forgo collection of the credit   premiums for these months, provided we receive the FERC clearing price.''   California's Independent System Operator, which covers 75 percent of the   state's power grid, has accused generators of overcharging customers by $6.2   billion since May.   Houston-based Duke said that during the months of January and February its   bids included a credit premium to cover the ''substantial risk'' of   nonpayment. Duke said the credit premium and market condition were   responsible for its bids exceeding the FERC determined market clearing price.   FERC had set a $273 megawatt per hour cap on power sales to California during   the Stage 3 emergencies in January and February.   Shares of Duke were up $1.27, or more than 3 percent, to $39.15 in afternoon   trading on the New York Stock Exchange, compared to a 52-week high of   $45.2188 and low of $24.8750.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------  March 26, 2001  Power Woes Raise Questions Over Control of Gas Pipelines  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and LOWELL BERGMAN  arly last year, the El Paso Natural Gas Company took bids from two dozen   companies for the right to ship enough natural gas through its pipeline from   Texas and New Mexico to meet one-sixth of the daily demand of energy-starved   California.   The winner: El Paso's sister company, the El Paso Merchant Energy Company,   which buys, sells and trades natural gas. The bidding was not close. El Paso   Merchant offered twice as much for the capacity as the other companies bid,   in total, for bits and pieces.  Why pay so much more? California officials, who are pressing a complaint   against El Paso at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, say the answer   is simple. The state contends that El Paso Merchant, with help from its   sister company, saw the transaction as a way to manipulate the price of   natural gas by using its control of pipeline capacity.   According to sealed documents obtained by The New York Times that are part of   filings in the federal case, executives at El Paso Merchant said internally   that the deal would give them \"more control\" of gas markets, including the   \"ability to influence the physical market\" to benefit the company's financial   positions.  El Paso executives called the accusations fanciful, and in a formal response   to California's complaint, said the state \"grossly distorted\" company   documents by quoting words and phrases out of context.  The dispute opens a window on an important debate about oversight of the   natural gas industry, which fuels a growing share of the nation's electric   power plants.  At issue is whether current safeguards do enough to prevent anticompetitive   abuses in the marketing and trading of natural gas, and whether federal   regulators adequately enforce existing rules. In particular, many industry   officials question whether regulated pipeline companies are able to favor   unregulated sister companies that trade natural gas and are free to maximize   profits.  More than 200,000 miles of interstate pipelines crisscross the country,   moving natural gas from Canada, the Southwest and other producing regions to   fuel factories, power utilities and heat houses.   Not long ago, many parts of the country had excess pipeline capacity. But   experts say that several regions, including California, New York and New   England, now face constraints as demand soars for gas to fuel power plants.   In California, state officials and utility executives said the documents in   the federal case, and El Paso's actions, were proof that the state's energy   crisis stemmed not just from an ill-conceived deregulation plan but from   price manipulation and profiteering.  \"They are the market maker with this pipeline,\" said Loretta Lynch, the   president of the California Public Utilities Commission, which has struggled   to cope with skyrocketing power prices and supply shortages.   El Paso \"sets the price in California,\" Ms. Lynch said, and what it did was   intentional. \"It has affected the price,\" she said, \"for everything related   to heat and electrical power prices in the state.\"   California's complaint to the federal agency contends that El Paso Merchant   \"has hoarded capacity and refused to attractively price unused capacity\" on   the pipeline. The state also charges that El Paso Natural Gas, the pipeline's   owner, has had no incentive to spur competition, by offering discounts to   other users, because the two companies are corporate siblings. The state said   that El Paso had violated federal natural gas statutes that prohibit   anticompetitive behavior.  The sealed filings in the El Paso case indicated that the company expected to   make money by widening the \"basis spread\"  * the difference between what gas   can be bought for in producing basins of Texas and New Mexico, at one end of   the pipeline, and its price on delivery to Southern California.  As it turned out, spreads widened enormously over the last year as the price   of gas soared in California, adding to costs for wholesale electricity that   pushed the biggest utilities near bankruptcy. California utilities paid $6.2   billion above competitive prices for wholesale electricity over the last 10   months, state officials estimated. The utilities are not allowed to recoup   the costs from customers. While the cost of 1,000 cubic feet of gas typically   is less than $1 higher at the California end of the pipeline, spot prices in   the state rose to almost $50 more than the Texas- New Mexico price in   December.  To executives of the parent company, the El Paso Corporation, the accusations   of market manipulation are ludicrous.   High gas prices in California, El Paso executives said in interviews, are   easily explained by soaring demand, the poor credit standing of the state's   utilities and the failure of the utilities to retain pipeline capacity or   store enough gas for winter.  \"The idea that anybody is holding back on California is really ridiculous,\"   said Clark C. Smith, president of El Paso Merchant's operations in North   America.   Some El Paso customers, though, agreed with California officials. The Pacific   Gas & Electric Company, the San Francisco-based utility, condemned El Paso in   a filing with the federal agency after its lawyers reviewed the sealed   company documents.   \"It is now very clear from the business records of El Paso Energy   Corporation,\" the utility said in the filing, \"that the business strategy El   Paso Merchant was authorized at the highest corporate levels to pursue   involved manipulation of price spreads.\"   The agency has not ruled on California's complaint, which asks that the deal   between El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant be invalidated. Based on the   agency's history of policing energy providers lightly, many industry   observers predicted that the complaint would be dismissed, perhaps as soon as   the agency's public meeting on Wednesday.  Nonetheless, El Paso Merchant is feeling some pressure. The subsidiary said   recently that it planned to relinquish control of all but about 22 percent of   the capacity on the pipeline to California, rather than exercise an option   that would have allowed it to retain the entire capacity of 1.2 billion cubic   feet of gas a day.   Critics said they believed El Paso made the move in hopes of lessening the   chance of government action. El Paso executives deny that but do say that   their decision was influenced by the backlash over the arrangement.  Surrendering the pipeline capacity made for a \"gut-wrenching\" decision, Mr.   Smith said, but was \"a first- class gesture\" to California. El Paso Merchant   paid $38.5 million to control the pipeline capacity from March 1, 2000, until   May 31, 2001. While Mr. Clark said he did not know the return on that   investment, he acknowledged that it was lucrative.  \"No doubt about it,\" Mr. Clark said, \"we made good money.\"   The question of whether El Paso's conduct has driven gas prices higher is   expected to be scrutinized by legislators in Sacramento this week. The   company also faces several lawsuits, including one by the city of Los   Angeles, that accuse it of conspiring with other companies to prevent   pipeline projects that could have eased California's energy crisis. El Paso   denied the accusation.  With pipeline capacity and gas supplies tighter, concerns about   anticompetitive behavior have increased as price volatility has created   soaring profits for energy marketers and traders.   Dynegy Inc., a Houston-based energy trader, was once the target of complaints   to federal regulators that it had artificially raised prices by abusing   capacity that it controlled on El Paso's pipeline to California.  In a filing with regulators in January, Dynegy contended that pipeline   companies routinely favored affiliates. \"Abuses abound because of financial   windfalls, difficulty of detection, lengthy investigations and increased   complexity of the market,\" the company said.  \"There are some red flags right now,\" said William L. Massey, a member of the   Federal Energy Regulatory Commission since 1993. Mr. Massey said he was   troubled by the potential for abuses when pipeline companies own gas and   power marketing subsidiaries as well as electric plants fueled by natural   gas. El Paso is in all those businesses.  \"What the commission ought to be serious about is: What are the forces at   work? Is it simply robust markets responding to true supply-and-demand   signals, or is it a market defined by market power and some measure of   affiliate abuse?\" he said.   Many in the industry do not believe changes are needed.   \"There are rules in place today that protect against affiliate abuse,\" said   Stanley Horton, chief executive for gas pipeline operations at the Enron   Corporation and chairman of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of   America, the industry's trade group, referring to the rules under which   California has brought its complaint about El Paso.  To its critics, El Paso epitomizes competitive concerns. It operates the   nation's largest network of interstate pipelines and owns one of the largest   reserves of natural gas. With its recent acquisition of the Coastal   Corporation, another large pipeline operator, El Paso has a market   capitalization of $32 billion.   At a conference at El Paso headquarters in Houston in February, analysts   heard executives predict net profits of $1.7 billion this year. El Paso's   much better known rival, Enron, with its headquarters a few blocks away, is   expected to earn about $1.4 billion.  El Paso Merchant provides the strongest growth. Two years ago, the unit's   profits, before interest payments and taxes, were $99 million; this year, it   is expected to have $700 million in North America alone. In its latest   quarterly report, El Paso attributed those profits, in part, to \"commodity   market and trading margins\" that were enhanced by \"power price volatility,   particularly in the Western United States.\"   Critics contend that El Paso set out to exploit those conditions. According   to the sealed filings, on Feb. 14, 2000, the day before El Paso Merchant was   awarded the pipeline capacity, executives made a presentation to William A.   Wise, chief executive of the parent company, laying out the rationale for the   bid.   The presentation outlined what it termed \"strategic advantages,\" including   \"more control of total physical markets\" and the \"ability to influence the   physical market to the benefit of any financial/hedge position,\" according to   the sealed filings. The passages suggested that El Paso expected the deal to   give it sway over the market for trading actual volumes of gas and to support   financial transactions it had entered into with other parties to limit its   risk.  For every one-cent increase in the spread on gas prices, the presentation   said, El Paso Merchant stood to make an additional $2.4 million.   Under the heading \"Challenges,\" according to the sealed filings, the   presentation stated that storage was needed \"to help manipulate physical   spreads, adding to the overall transport/storage cost.\"  On April 14, according to the sealed filings, El Paso Merchant's president at   the time, Greg G. Jenkins, wrote a memorandum to Mr. Wise involving an update   for directors meeting later that month. The memorandum stated: \"We will make   money two ways: 1) increase the load factor, 2) widen the basis spread.\"   The language appears to suggest that El Paso Merchant would profit by   increasing the gas flow in the pipeline  * the load factor  * while increasing   the difference between what gas could be bought for at one end and what it   could be sold for at the other end  * the basis spread.  In an interview, Mr. Smith, the El Paso Merchant executive, said that the   unit's prices, and profits, on bulk gas sales in California were locked in   months in advance, so that the company could not benefit from rising prices   in the spot market.   Otherwise, Mr. Smith declined to provide any details about money made on the   pipeline deal or about financial terms of the transactions that locked in   prices ahead of time. In addition, Mr. Smith said that nearly all of El Paso   Merchant's pipeline capacity was used every day when prices spiked late last   year, with no capacity withheld to increase prices.  The company did not respond last week to a request to discuss information in   the sealed documents. But El Paso Merchant, in a filing with federal   regulators, said California's complaint had \"misconstrued and incorrectly   interpreted\" what it termed \"snippets of data.\"  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------  SoCal Edison To Pay QFs On Going-Forward Basis    03/25/2001  Dow Jones News Service  (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)    ROSEMEAD, Calif. -(Dow Jones)- Edison International's (EIX) Southern   California Edison unit said that, in anticipation of pending action by the   California Public Utilities Commission to restructure the way qualifying   facility generators, or QFs, will be paid, the utility will resume payments   to QFs on a going-forward basis.   In a press release Sunday, Southern California Edison said it has set aside   funds in a separate account and will make payments in advance of expected   April deliveries.  Payment processing would begin immediately after the CPUC approves on Tuesday   a proposed decision to restructure QF prices.   Advance payments will be based on the generators' historical production level   and the PUC's pricing order.   The company said it will be able to make payments only up to \"an aggregate   amount that is available to us from rates actually received for QF payments.\"     Southern California Edison said that \"in recognition of the state's need for   all the electricity it can get during these times, SCE is hereby instituting   a program to pay those QFs that continue to provide electricity to the   utility.\"   The company is \"leaving it up to the discretion of the\" PUC \"as to how the   payment structure will be revamped and how we should allocate the payments to   QFs.\"   The PUC will likely approve a 20% rate increase for Southern California   Edison and PG&E Corp.'s (PCG) Pacific Gas & Electric on Tuesday, ending a   three-year-old retail rate freeze, two PUC commissioners told Dow Jones   Newswires on Saturday.   The increase also would let utilities start paying small independent power   producers on a forward basis for electricity sold directly to the utilities,   the commissioners said.   PG&E and SoCal Ed are now more than $13 billion in debt, have seen their   ratings downgraded to junk status by Wall Street credit agencies and have   defaulted on billions of dollars in dividend payments, power bills and bank   loans.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------  Legislative firebrand Burton plays hardball in debate over power   Posted at 9:53 p.m. PST Sunday, March 25, 2001   BY HALLYE JORDAN     Mercury News Sacramento Bureau       SACRAMENTO -- It didn't take long for perpetually impatient John Burton to   size up the conference call as a waste of time.   Twenty minutes and four curses into the conversation, the president pro tem   of the state Senate announced to the utility company executives, outgoing   Clinton Cabinet members and top state officials that he was putting down the   phone -- to shave.   Five minutes later, he stashed his Gillette Mach 3 and returned to the phone.   As he suspected, ``I didn't miss a thing.''   Welcome to the world of John Lowell Burton, perhaps the state's most   powerful, colorful and combative legislator. That Burton has ascended to the   top rung of political power in California surprises many, and perhaps no one   more than Burton himself.   The 68-year-old product of old school San Francisco politics has a penchant   for profanity and a demeanor that ricochets from volatile to gruff to goofy.   He fought a well-publicized battle against cocaine addiction that threatened   to end not only his political career but his life. Burton not only survived,   he thrived -- a die-hard liberal somehow succeeding in an age of centrism.   He has prevailed in part by balancing the two sides of his political persona:   the idealistic progressive and the pragmatic deal-maker.   Idealistic though he may be, Burton has a healthy appetite for hard-ball   politics. He's been known to abandon longtime supporters in favor of economic   special interests when it was politically expedient. He has a knack for   fundraising that makes political reformers blanch. And he delights in   jousting with the state's moderate Democratic governor, Gray Davis.   In his fourth year as Senate president pro tem, the second most powerful post   in Sacramento, Burton is up to his gold wire-rims and gray-flecked eyebrows   in the debate over rolling blackouts and energy industry bailouts.   The crisis has proved vexing for the veteran pol. Consumer groups are among   his most ardent supporters. Yet Burton feels compelled to find a way to keep   the lights on -- even though that means helping the cash-strapped utilities   that consumer groups love to hate.   It hasn't been easy. On Thursday, he showed his frustration with the   utilities during a Senate debate: ``I hope they go bankrupt. Let them go   belly up. I don't care anymore.''   Earlier in the session, Burton introduced a bill that would set up a state   power authority to help finance construction of new power plants. Another   bill he pushed would authorize the state to purchase electricity lines from   its cash-strapped utilities for at least $7 billion.   The subject of ongoing negotiations between the utilities and Davis, the   transmission line deal is intended to give taxpayers a valuable asset while   helping utility companies stay on their feet. ``If you go broke,'' Burton   said, ``you sell your car or you hock your watch.''   Republicans see Burton's plan as yet another example of big government run   amok.   ``He has that basic philosophy that says government wants to run   everything,'' said Assemblyman Tony Strickland, R-Camarillo.   Burton grew up on the outskirts of the Sunset district in San Francisco, the   youngest of three boys. His mother was a no-nonsense woman who, when her   husband refused to buy her a fur coat or a car, worked two jobs to purchase a   mink and a used blue Buick convertible.   His father was a doctor who practiced in poor neighborhoods and instilled in   his sons a gnawing need to help those less fortunate.   He is obviously his parents' child: The closets of his Potrero Hill home are   stuffed with suede jackets and tailored slacks that he regularly rotates into   the back seat of his car, where they are within easy reach in case he passes   a homeless shelter or some suffering soul on the street who looks his size.   ``My whole thing is caring for people on the edge that nobody gives a   (expletive deleted) about,'' Burton said.   Subtle, he is not: During the height of the debate over welfare reform, he   chided his peers for slashing welfare benefits by introducing a bill that   would have made it a crime to be poor.   Burton believes his party has sold out the disenfranchised in its quest to   capture the moderate middle.   ``Who stands for anything anymore?'' he sputters with an expletive. ``What's   wrong with making sure all kids have medical insurance?''   He seems to revel in his reputation as the only lawmaker willing to take on   the state's centrist governor. Their clashes are frequent, and Davis' staff   keeps a wary eye on Burton.   Last year, Davis proposed a scholarship program to reward high-achieving   students. Fearing the plan would siphon money from an existing program that   provides scholarships for poor students, Burton and a bipartisan group of   senators linked Davis' proposal to one expanding scholarships based on   financial need.   That meant both would become law if Davis signed either one. Burton said the   bill was the brainchild of all, but it bore his name for one reason: ``I   didn't want the governor to (expletive deleted) with it,'' he said. Davis   didn't.   Burton followed in the footsteps of his oldest brother, Phillip, a powerful,   legendary congressman who died in 1983.   John Burton spent 10 years in the Assembly and was elected to Congress in   1974. He served eight years before cocaine addiction forced him out of   politics and into a Scottsdale rehab clinic.   At some point, Burton said, he just got sick of doing drugs in any of the   dozens of anonymous Washington, D.C., hotel rooms he called home.   ``Finally,'' he said, ``it seemed to make a lot more sense to get some   treatment than be dead, or have a breakdown, or be in jail.''   His drug days return only in occasional dreams in which the cocaine   inevitably gets stuck in a straw or spills on the carpet.   Today, Burton's lone addiction is caffeine -- he regularly downs at least   four cappuccinos in the morning, insisting on extra-firm foam. And he may   have three Diet Cokes, each with a slice of lemon, during dinner.   For six years after his drug rehabilitation, Burton lived in San Francisco,   staying straight, playing racquetball, sunning on the deck of his home with   its sweeping vista of the downtown skyline.   He indulged in movies and made good money as a corporate lawyer. He also   played the stock market, accumulating wealth he pegs at $1.5 million, but   that financial disclosure statements indicate ranges between $1.7 million and   $7.2 million.   From Gap Inc. to Wal-Mart, Burton's portfolio is impressive, if incongruous:   This self-styled voice of the common man owns stocks in huge pharmaceutical,   high-tech, communications and oil and gas companies.   But his stock holdings are no more surprising than the fact that attorney   Burton, the champion of consumer issues, was once on retainer for Pacific Gas   & Electric Co.   In 1988, politics came knocking again. Burton's old Assembly seat was open,   and his pal, then Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, desperately needed allies to   help squelch rebel Democrats who were challenging his control.   ``No (expletive deleted) way,'' Burton replied three times before finally   relenting -- and winning.   Eight years later, he was elected to the Senate. Two years after that, his   colleagues chose him to serve in the state's highest legislative post, Senate   president pro tem.   While his personality and political instincts helped win him the spot,   another asset propelled Burton to victory: His ability to raise boatloads of   campaign cash.   He turns even chance encounters into potentially profitable conversations. In   early December, a friend who ran into Burton in a San Francisco restaurant   mentioned that he'd dropped off a Christmas gift at Burton's office. The   senator didn't skip a beat. ``Is it cash?'' he asked with a quick grin.   Even people who detest Burton's politics tend to like the man.   The Rev. Lou Sheldon of the Traditional Values Coalition said there isn't a   legislator he disagrees with more on hot-button topics such as gay rights and   abortion. Still, he can't help but enjoy sparring with Burton.   No `stuffed shirt'   ``He's not a stuffed shirt,'' Sheldon said. ``He doesn't double-talk you.''   Twice divorced, Burton met his first wife in 1963 at a meeting in the home of   Vince Hallinan, the famed San Francisco civil rights lawyer. She was the   daughter of a labor leader who organized plantation workers and longshoremen   in Hawaii. Married for seven years, they had one daughter, Kimiko Burton, the   acting San Francisco public defender. He remarried in 1975, and divorced in   1981.   These days, as he makes his way through the Capitol, Burton often plays the   gracious flirt, chatting up female lobbyists and colleagues. The next moment,   he might be blowing up at someone, yelling four-letter words that echo down   the high-ceilinged corridors and force staffers to keep his office doors shut   so as not to offend touring school children.   State Sen. Sheila Kuehl, D-Los Angeles, once joked that Cal-Tech had   developed an ``FPM'' scale for the number of obscenities Burton spews per   minute. ``More than 50 FPMs,'' she said, ``and John is really, really mad.   Less than 10, check his breathing.''   Beneath the bluster is a shrewd politician who can grasp the high points of   the most complex subjects, instruct his staff to figure out the details and   seal the deal with his word. As one pundit put it, Burton is the guy who   can't read a map, but never gets lost.   Consider 1998, Burton's first year as Senate leader. Then-Gov. Pete Wilson   and the Republicans wanted to slash the state's hefty vehicle license tax as   a way to share California's $4.4 billion budget surplus. But Burton and the   Democrats wanted to earmark the money for the needy who had taken cuts during   the recession.   Burton's staff devised a plan to phase in the tax cuts over several years,   but only if the state was rolling in money. That protected revenues for the   Democrats' pet projects, while giving Wilson bragging rights to a huge tax   cut.   `Safe' seat for a liberal   Being a larger-than-life liberal in the nation's most liberal city provides a   sense of security that few other politicians enjoy. Burton hasn't faced a   serious political challenge since the 1960s, and occupying a ``safe'' seat   allows him to carry controversial, special-interest bills -- even when they   tick off his core supporters.   Burton paid scant attention when environmentalists opposed his efforts to   make it easier to fill in the San Francisco Bay for runway expansions at San   Francisco International Airport. He shrugged off criticism about a bill he is   carrying that would benefit a large campaign donor who owns an out-of-state   gambling facility. And he alienated campaign finance reform advocates by   pushing a campaign contribution and spending limits initiative that they said   was too permissive.   Consumer groups chafed at one of Burton's first legislative responses to the   energy crisis: using $400 million of taxpayer money to buy electricity for   the cash-strapped utilities. Still, they turn to Burton.   ``Every morning when I get up, for the last two months, I say a little prayer   for John Burton,'' said consumer activist Harvey Rosenfield. ``If there is   going to be one hero in this four-year deregulation debacle, it's going to be   John Burton.''   Those who watched Burton pull back from the brink of self-destruction and   stage his political comeback have seen him work magic before. They hope he   has one trick left to solve the energy mess. Burton says the crisis is the   most daunting political problem he has faced in his long career.   ``I don't think I have the power or the ability to put the toothpaste back in   the tube,'' Burton said with a shrug. ``But we're working on it.''  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------  Web of power intrigue alleged   Many say generators shared data on the Internet to exploit the market.   March 25, 2001   By KIMBERLY KINDY  The Orange County Register   Power producers selling electricity to California's fledgling deregulated   market shared confidential data that allowed them to watch one another's   every move - giving them leverage to drive up prices and helping to launch   the state last spring into its energy crisis, records and interviews show.   The information provided a picture of the state's electricity grid in motion:   The amount of electricity being generated, price bids for electricity, the   location of units down for repairs, schedules of electricity delivery over   transmission lines, and the location of transmission bottlenecks.   It was all done over the World Wide Web.   Most of the Web sites have been shut down, amid allegations that the   information was used to \"game,\" or manipulate, the electric market and gouge   Californians out of billions of dollars while bringing the state's largest   utilities to the brink of bankruptcy and prompting rolling blackouts.   At least one site remains, and negotiations to resurrect another   controversial site are under way, frustrating consumer groups and antitrust   lawyers who contend the power producers have found new means to collude,   using state-of-the-art computer technology.   \"Openness and willingness to share information was turned against us and used   to manipulate the market rather than to bolster the market,\" said consumer   advocate Michael Shames of the Utility Consumers Action Network.   \"It's a lesson that is going to cost billions of dollars.\"   The data sharing began as a way to ensure the smooth operation of the state's   electrical grid, by giving timely information to all the people in the   market: power producers, utilities, those operating the grid.   In recent weeks, federal and state regulators have accused the power   companies of charging too much and manipulating the market.   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered 13 power generators to   justify their prices or pay nearly $70 million in refunds.   It also accused two producers with Orange County operations of creating   scarcity and gouging by as much as $10.8 million.   Last week, the California Independent System Operator, which manages three-   quarters of the state's electricity grid, filed a complaint with federal   officials alleging that 21 power producers overcharged the state by $6.8   billion since May 2000.   Power producers have routinely called the investigations \"witch hunts\" and   believe they will conclude with officials seeing that normal market   conditions - not market manipulation - led to the high prices. They say the   data from Web sites were used to help manage their work and design trading   strategies -- all legally.   \"It's no different from putting together a weather forecast,\" said Randy   Hickok, man aging director of California assets for Duke Energy Corp.   \"You use the information to determine your trading strategy.\"   Live data feeds on output, transmission   A review of a dozen studies and investigations into California's electricity   market, coupled with interviews with more than 20 economists, antitrust   experts, Web site designers, power merchants and utility officials reveals a   key flaw in the market: It hinged on instant communications over the   Internet.   By the summer of 1999, three main Web sites were online and being used by the   power producers.   One was operated by the Western Systems Coordinating Council - which includes   power merchants from 17 Western states and parts of Canada and Mexico. The   council oversees the smooth flow of power around the West. This private site   went offline in October 2000. It provided live data that showed the most   detailed information available on generation and transmission of electricity.   The site might be revived. The council has paid for a new software package to   get direct feeds from power producers, and talks are under way.   Another private, now-defunct Web site, which was run by the exchange that   until January organized California's hourly energy auctions, provided live   data showing energy up for auction, bidding prices, and when the bids were   accepted.   Still another site - The Open Access Same-Time Information System, or OASIS,   provides data for the day- ahead market that shows how much capacity is   available on transmission lines so generators can figure out what paths to   use to deliver electricity.   The OASIS site still provides data about bottlenecks that can affect prices.   However, this has caused less concern because it can't be acted on   immediately. It's only used for bids for the next day's market, and by then   congestion could be cleared. The Web sites offered rows of numbers in charts   and tables. The power traders downloaded the data into computer programs that   spit out maps of the electricity grid that were updated every few seconds.   Traders could view the maps as they bought and sold energy off the   trading-room floors - expansive rooms loaded with computers, scrolling   tickers and huge televisions tuned to the Weather Channel.   The California Power Exchange, which held the energy auction, in April 1998   identified five merchants that were dominating the market. They were Williams   Cos., Dynegy Inc., Reliant Energy Inc., Sempra Energy and Duke.   The question at the heart of a series of state and federal inquiries is   whether the power producers conspired or colluded to fix prices at inflated   rates, or whether market conditions prompted them to mirror one another's   bidding strategies.   Price-fixing is illegal, a violation of federal and state antitrust laws,   which were established to ensure that fair competition drives the price for   goods and services.   No smoke-filled rooms, lawyer says   San Diego attorney Mike Aguirre and another team of lawyers, suing on behalf   of the city of San Francisco, say the Web sites were a new kind of collusion,   made possible by two things: a market dominated by just a few players, and   technology that allowed those players to view the same live data in the same   format.   Aguirre said they knew this would make it possible to take the same actions   to drive up prices. The Web sites were part of the plan, and it worked, he   said.   \"They are now marching lockstep and communicating in the way a cartel   communicates, only they are actually much more sophisticated - you aren't   going to catch them together in some smoky room,\" said Aguirre.   By the time the two main sites were shut down because of complaints that they   were being used to drive up prices, the generators had a lock on the market   and understood the nuances of how to manipulate it, he said. The Independent   System Operator believes the Web site data were used last summer to \"exercise   market power and (for) gaming in the real market.\" The accusation was made in   an Oct. 10 letter to owners of the coordinating council Web site.   State power grid officials said they routinely saw power producers triple   their prices within minutes of a bottleneck on a transmission line. Kellan   Fluckiger, the grid's operations vice president, likened it to a closure on a   state highway that might give businesses - that know they are the final stop   for bread or water - the incentive to mark up prices and take advantage of a   captive clientele.   \"We saw generators on the right side of the congestion change their bids from   $50 a megawatt(-hour) to $150 immediately after there was a clog in the   line,\" said Fluckiger.   Another strategy to create price spikes, according to grid manager Jim   Detmers, was to intentionally pull generators offline to create scarcity.   Reliant Energy Vice President John Stout said neither his company nor his   competitors used the Web site data to fix electricity prices.   \"There are two sides to this. On the one hand you can say that people were   able to quickly start up their generators to keep the lights on,\" Stout said.   \"On the other hand you can say that someone kept generators offline to   extract more money. But that didn't happen. Shutting down a generator when   there's an opportunity to sell energy isn't a wise thing to do.\"   Utility executives - who bought power from the generating companies - have   fought for the live data to be restricted to those responsible for managing   the transmission lines. For everyone else, they want it embargoed for a week   or more.   \"A delay should be enough to prevent real-time action - using the information   to create congestion or to take advantage of bottlenecks - but would allow   for analysis later,\" said Gary Stern, director of market monitoring and   analysis for Southern California Edison.   Consumer groups say they are shocked the live data were being shared, because   power merchants have fought the release of the information to regulators   investigating the market.   \"The mantra of the energy industry is, 'All this information is protected as   a trade secret. Regulators, the government, the public can't see any of it   because it would give competitors too much information,' \" said consumer   advocate Doug Heller. \"But internally the companies seem to be more than   happy to share and have access to crucial market data as a tool to manipulate   the market.\"   Southwestern University law professor Lawrence Sullivan, a national antitrust   expert, said antitrust cases are tough to prove. Sometimes there is no   collusion, just a group of individuals or companies presented with similar   conditions, all reacting in the same way. He uses a rainstorm analogy.   \"Suddenly it starts raining; you put your umbrella up and so does everyone   else,\" said Sullivan. \"You are acting for you own reasons and you don't care   if anyone else puts their umbrella up. You are doing it for yourself.\"   Equal data sharing in 'transparent market'   From the regulators' perspective, the only requirement on data-sharing is   that it be done equally, so that all market participants can take advantage   of it. Moreover, the federal commission actually requires the OASIS site.   Commissioner William Massey said the economic principle driving the   commission's philosophy is that sharing information, or having a \"transparent   market,\" should foster healthy competition. But Massey concedes California   has too few players and not enough electricity to have a truly competitive   market.   Stanford University economist Frank Wolak - who does market surveillance   studies for the grid operator - said people expected that federal regulators   would protect consumers by setting price caps if the market became unwieldy,   allowing flaws in the market to be worked out.   He blames federal regulators rather than generators.   Generators' \"job is to maximize profits. It's like asking a predator not to   seek its prey,\" said Wolak. \"Lions are supposed to eat zebras, but the game   warden is supposed to do something if they are eating too many zebras. FERC   has an obligation to do something if the prices are going to kill the   California economy.\"  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  --------------------------------  Studies show pitfalls in power market   Investigators believe the deregulated system has opened itself up to   manipulation of supply and pricing.   March 25, 2001   By KIMBERLY KINDY  The Orange County Register   Nearly a dozen studies and investigations have found evidence of flaws and   weaknesses in California's deregulated electricity market that - if detected   and rooted out earlier - could have prevented the state from spiraling into   crisis.   A growing number of lawmakers, energy regulators and academic experts believe   power producers exploited these weaknesses to \"game\" the market.   Earlier this month, the state Senate formed an investigative committee to   determine if energy producers illegally manipulated the market. The move came   less than a week after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered power   producers to refund nearly $70 million for energy sold in January, unless   they can justify the prices charged. In other words, for the first time the   onus is on the generators: They must prove they didn't manipulate the market.   State Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, who will chair the new investigative   committee, has reviewed piles of evidence collected against the power   producers and believes it's time to determine whe ther Californians have   become victims of a new energy cartel.   \"Not only is there a grassy knoll, there are many who believe the gunman is   still standing there firing,\" said Dunn, an attorney who has successfully   litigated against the tobacco industry for engaging in unfair business   practices.   The market flaws that allowed for manipulation include:   The \"crazy auction.\" That is how Gov. Gray Davis described the state's daily   energy market when the crisis hit. The auction guaranteed that every seller   would get paid the last bid price. The model was supposed to encourage power   producers to bid early to avoid being locked out when the utilities had   enough electricity lined up. But sellers never did fill the energy needs   early in the day, so by the time the market was about to close, buyers had   increased their bidding price in an effort to secure enough energy. As a   result, the sellers were always awarded the highest bid price - even if 90   percent of the energy had been secured at a lower rate earlier in the day.   Lack of generation. The California Energy Commission says the state's   consumption grew by no more than 5 percent from 1999 to 2000, leading many to   argue that scarcity alone could not have driven the market so out of control.   However, economists say it may have contributed to the problem. Here's why:   even with the commission's projections - which are disputed by generators who   place increases at closer to 20 percent - the rate of consumption was nearly   equal to the rate of generation. Economists say a healthy market for   ratepayers will only come when generation exceeds consumption by at least 20   percent.   Instant updates. The ability to see real-time, market-sensitive information   allowed power producers maximum potential for com mand ing the highest   possible price. Two Web sites in particular allowed generators to see what   their competitors were up to, minute by minute, as they bought and sold   energy. The information-sharing is at the heart of two lawsuits filed against   the power producers, accusing them of violating antitrust laws to fix prices.   Producers say they did nothing wrong.   Regulatory gaps. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission had the power to   step in and set caps to stabilize the market. The idea was to allow the   private energy suppliers to make profits, but not at rates that will harm the   economy. The decision not to use this authority emboldened the merchants,   resulting in increased profits from 1999 to 2000 of more than 300 percent,   according to consumer groups and a state Independent System Operator filing   with the federal commission.   Too few sellers. Even when production levels climb, economists say, the   marketplace will be better served if more players are introduced. Most of   California's energy needs have been met by five major suppliers, each having   about 20 percent of the state's business. Energy and antitrust experts say   it's too easy to mirror one another's actions and form a mon opoly with a   group of sellers this small.   Abrupt shift to a new market. The state didn't build safety bridges from the   old system to the new. For example, in other states where deregulation has   been enacted, the utilities sold off their power generators, but only on the   condition that the new buyers sell them electricity at a locked-in, low rate   for the first few years. Economists say this would have helped stabilize   costs until the new market was established.   Dunn's committee will look at ways to restructure the marketplace so that   prices can stabilize. But a second goal is to determine whether power   generators have criminally exploited weaknesses in the marketplace.   The power generators say they've endured scrutiny in studies and state and   federal investigations, and that no proof of criminal wrongdoing was found.   \"There have been at least nine investigations that have looked at this ...   including a federal investigation,\" said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director   of the Independent Energy Producers, a trade organization for power   generators. \"To date no one has concluded there is any illegal activity or   any other kind of misconduct.\"   But Dunn, antitrust experts - and even the researchers -- said these repeated   claims by power producers and their representatives misstate what the studies   show.   Here's why: The academic studies and market surveillance reports never aimed   to prove illegal activity. Instead their goal was to determine if the Federal   Power Act needed to be enacted by FERC. The act requires that the federal   regulators step in when evidence of market power, or monopoly power over   prices, is being exercised by the generators -something that nearly every   study found.   \"Their only job is to look at if the market is dysfunctional,\" said Dunn.   \"They are not looking at it through the lens of a prosecutor.\"   MIT economist Paul Joskow said his work shows that supply and demand   scenarios could not possibly have led to the prices Californians have been   paying for electricity. Market power had to be exerted, but he said he didn't   have the power to subpoena documents or witnesses that might have revealed   illegal activity.   \"My objective was not to determine if anyone engaged in illegal behavior,\"   said Joskow, who conducted research that was funded by Edison International.   \"It was designed to assist FERC ... then it was up to FERC to decide the   implications in enforcing the Federal Power Act, which requires that they set   just and reasonable prices.\"   Joskow's work showed that prices, in many instances, were twice as high as   they should have been.   Stanford University economist Frank Wolak, who heads a team of economists   that conducts regular market surveillance reports for California's main   electricity grid operator, said he has repeatedly found evidence of market   manipulation and reported it to FERC.   In 2000 alone, Wolak said, his work showed that market manipulation accounted   for an $8 billion overcharge out of the $27 billion that was paid for   electricity in the California market.   However, no action was ever taken by federal officials.   \"It's frustrating because they say, 'Be very vigilant in searching for market   power,' but when we find it, they don't do anything,\" Wolak said. \"They say,   'Oh no, that's not market power.' If they would define what market power is,   we would be looking for it. But I don't think they want us to find it.\"   Wolak said he believes that recent actions by federal officials - in which   they have ordered refunds - represent a token gesture and are a response to   intense public pressure for them to act. So far, they've identified less than   $80 million in potential overcharges, compared with the billions that Wolak   and others have identified.   One federal commissioner agrees with Wolak. Commissioner William Massey said   the commission has resisted stepping in and using its authority because it   believed the free market would correct itself. Massey said members are   beginning to intervene, but he, too, believes the actions should be more   aggressive.   \"We have been the beneficiaries of countless market monitoring reports for   two or three years now. Very sophisticated reports that have talked about the   existence of market power,\" Massey said. \"I think we should have heeded those   warnings. I think we should have done a better job.\"   Last year, FERC did its own investigation to determine if power producers   were conspiring and intentionally taking generators offline to drive up   prices. But that study - often cited by power generators as proof that they   have been cleared of wrongdoing - was cursory.   FERC described the work as an \"informal investigation\" and said at the   beginning of the report that it did not subpoena witnesses or documents. Most   of the work was done over the telephone with a few power plants subjected to   scheduled inspections.   \"That FERC study was ridiculous,\" said Severin Borenstein, director of the   University of California Energy Institute. \"They asked (the power producers)   if they were manipulating. I guess I wasn't surprised by their answer.\"   Attorneys who have accused the power producers of breaking anti-trust laws   said they are using the academic studies to help them with their own   investigations.   But they serve as a starting point.   The lawyers are looking at the evidence found by researchers - why they   believed the market was being manipulated - and will subpoena the necessary   people and records to see if there is proof that illegal actions were behind   the manipulation.   \"It's not all in one place, and it's not sitting on a silver platter, but we   believe it's out there,\" said Len Simon, an attorney working on the city of   San Francisco's lawsuit filed against power producers. \"They (academic   researchers) have found evidence that these high prices are not purely the   result of market forces, but they have not been able to secure conclusive   proof. That's what we plan to do.\"  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------  Headed toward 'disaster'   Analysts: California fails in bid to get handle on crisis  By Steve GeissingerSACRAMENTO BUREAU   SACRAMENTO -- Big power rate hikes. Dangerous rolling blackouts. Volatile   utility bankruptcies.   For months, all were deemed nightmares to be thwarted at virtually any cost.   Yet now they all appear likely, even inevitable, according to experts who see   California tumbling from an energy crisis into something worse.   \"We're getting closer andcloser to a situation that could be described as a   disaster for the state,\" said James Swee-ney, director of Stanford   University's energy institute.   Energy woes are starting to hinder California's economy, the sixth largest in   the world.   At the same time, Gov. Gray Davis' 11th-hour, multibillion-dollar attack on   the crisis starting last winter has so sapped the state budget that   government fiscal watchdogs say it's even a potential threat to essential   ongoing programs.   And despite the effort, analysts say California appears headed toward just   what Davis and legislative leaders most feared -- major rate hikes that would   eat into consumers' budgets and a summer filled with rolling blackouts that   endanger people and pummel businesses.   \"These were the sort of things we said would happen unless the governor and   lawmakers started taking actions beyond what they've been willing to take,\"   Sweeney said.   But the state's quest to ease the energy price and supply crisis amid a   tangle of powerful, competing interests has turned into such a roller coaster   ride of ups, downs and surprises that increasing clashes and frustration are   slowing or even derailing proposed remedies.   By default, experts say, the utilities may wind up in bankruptcies that throw   the energy crisis and California's fate largely to the federal courts.   Signs of trouble abound:   Rolling blackouts during two spring days earlier this week were caused in   part by small generators shutting down after utilities missed making payments   for months. Many view the outages, the first since January and the first to   strike Southern California, as a harbinger of summer woes despite attempts to   foster greater conservation and build power plants.   Though there have been lurches toward an agreement, negotiators apparently   remain substantially apart in secret talks on a state plan to financially   rescue nearly bankrupt utilities.   Major stakeholders in the energy crisis, and their court cases, continue to   threaten the utilities with bankruptcy at any time.   The fiscally ailing utilities continue to seek rate increases from state   regulators -- a move that politicians fearing voter backlash oppose but   energy and economic experts support as the quickest way out of the crisis.   With the state's bill for short-term power buys hitting $4 billion, some   lawmakers are resisting the administration's requests for additional funds.   The governor, who has declared a state of emergency, has the authority to tap   funds on his own but fears the political fallout.   Long-term power contracts negotiated by the state won't cover as large a part   as hoped of California's demand for electricity until 2004, indicating that   the state will be forced to seek power for some time on the costly short-term   market.   Many more power generators, frustrated at not being paid by the utilities,   may either cease operations or start selling out of state.   There remains little sign that federal regulators will order tough wholesale   price caps, though there are now indications they may pressure generators to   rebate some alleged overcharges. Numerous government investigations are   looking into allegations of price gouging.   Critics are balking at secrecy shrouding the Davis administration's costly,   short-term power buys to thwart rolling blackouts, purchase of long-term   contracts and utility bailout talks. Officials say the secrecy is needed to   avoid skewing the market.   Some critics say the state is failing to address natural gas supplies and   costs, an underlying cause of the crisis. Republican lawmakers have futilely   called for a special legislative session, as was convened on power woes, to   address the issue.   Municipal utilities, including Alameda, Palo Alto, Lodi and Santa Clara, say   they are tired of being asked to participate in rolling blackouts. And   they've provided power to the grid, for which they haven't been repaid.   Nowhere recently has the tension over the crisis emerged more publicly than   in the Legislature, where thwarting utility bankruptcies has been the mantra   of the administration and legislative leaders for months.Lawmakers' outrage   But several lawmakers were outraged earlier this week as they battled   utilities' reluctance to repay the state or small generators for power.   \"Let'em go belly up,\" said Senate leader John Burton, D-San Francisco. \"I   don't care anymore.\"   Sen. Debra Bowen, chair of the Senate energy and utilities committee, said   she felt \"the legislative equivalent of road rage\" at Pacific, Gas and   Electric, which serves Northern California, and Southern California Edison.   The utilities, trapped between skyrocketing electricity prices and capped   retail rates, amassed $14 billion in debts that left them teetering on the   edge of bankruptcy, unable to buy power. The state has spent $4 billion   brokering power sales as it works on a rescue plan for the utilities.$50   million daily   But negotiations on a bond-backed bailout of the utilities appear stalled. In   the meantime, the state is continuing to broker power sales on their behalf   at the staggering cost of about $50 million daily.   Controller Kathleen Connell earlier this week blocked what she described as   Davis' effort to tap billions more in state money for the energy crisis,   saying such a transfer of funds could leave California short of cash for   essential services such as public schools.   Since the state started making emergency power buys in January, the budget   surplus has fallen from $8.5 billion to about $3.2 billion, she said.   Likewise, Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, chairman of the joint Legislative   Budget Committee, has warned the Davis administration that he will try to   block additional funds for emergency, short-term power purchases.   Peace wants to see the state Public Utilities Commission make progress toward   recovering from utilities the money that already has been spent.   The state budget also is being endangered by slow progress toward issuing   bonds that are intended to repay coffers for short- and long-term power buys,   according to Connell.   The delay is due in part to action by the utilities, which are appealing a   ruling by the PUC that essentially ensures the state will be repaid.   In the face of myriad signs of trouble, Davis asserts that he is making   steady, certain progress toward solution of the crisis.   But Davis' aides privately acknowledge that his fate is inevitably tied to   his handling of the crisis.Jones'opportunity?   A potential Republican opponent during Davis' re-election bid next year,   Secretary of State Bill Jones, is pressing what he views as an opportunity   big enough to drive his campaign through in 2002.   Under Davis' leadership, Jones said, California is \"essentially mortgaging   our future for our children and grandchildren.\"   Meanwhile, consumer advocates are still threatening a 2002 initiative that   would overturn rate increases and any taxpayer-financed bailout of   investor-owned utilities.   \"Davis has not taken the action that is needed to solve this problem,\" said   Harvey Rosenfield of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. \"Unless   he does, he's finished.\"  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------  Published Sunday, March 25, 2001   Experts predict summer outages Some say conserving not enough  By Mike Taugher  TIMES STAFF WRITER   For months, the brains guiding California's approach to resolving the state's   energy crisis have been focused on getting through the summer.   They now must be wondering if they will make it through the spring.   California was plunged deeper into crisis last week on a variety of fronts as   authorities escalated their claims that hugely profitable power companies are   largely to blame.   Two days of widespread rolling blackouts. Small generators shutting down   because they have not been paid, and state legislators unable to agree on how   to bring them back. Accusations that big generators have overcharged   billions. State officials scrambling to protect a once-generous surplus that   is hemorrhaging. The revelation that Gov. Gray Davis' efforts to secure   long-term contracts for cheap electricity have so far fallen short of   expectations.   All in all, one hell of a week.   And this is supposed to be the easy time of year.   The state's energy crisis is deepening. Positions are hardening, and the way   out of this mess has never looked so difficult.   But it is the coming summer months, when peak demand for electricity will be   50 percent higher than it is now, that is of greatest concern to policymakers   and energy officials.   Most experts agree that there is a bona fide shortage of electricity;   official state estimates are in the range of 5,000 to 7,000 megawatts in the   summer, or enough to power 5 million to 7 million homes.   The California Energy Commission says, however, that with strong conservation   efforts and new power plants, blackouts can be averted.   Others are not so optimistic.   An influential East Coast energy consulting firm recently estimated the state   will see 20 hours of outages in the coming months, but others fear it will be   far worse.   One industry representative said the number of blackouts would be in the   dozens. And he said if high wholesale prices have shocked anyone, they could   double again before summer is out.   \"The prices are going to be more damaging than they are right now,\" said Gary   Ackerman, director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an association of   energy generators and traders. \"I would say in the range of $500 to $600.\"   Consider this: A year ago one megawatt-hour was going for $30. Last summer,   wholesale prices rose to nearly $150, and that was high enough to drive the   state's two largest utilities to near-bankruptcy and force a state bailout.   Today, as the state shells out $50 million a day to keep the lights on,   prices are at about $300.   The reasons that experts give for the problems that California faces this   summer are numerous and many are well-documented. No major new power plants   built in a decade. A growing, technology-dependent population that is using   more and more power. Drought in the Pacific Northwest. Growing Western states   using the juice they used to sell to the Golden State. And now small   generators are shutting down or threatening to sell out of state because they   have not been paid.   But there is also growing evidence that many of the problems are caused by   generators and traders unfairly taking advantage of a dysfunctional market,   some analysts said.   \"The other thing that makes this summer a little tenuous is last summer our   experience with generators and traders timing the market to maximize their   profit,\" said Claudia Chandler, spokeswoman for the California Energy   Commission.   Because of mild weather last summer, the highest peak of demand for   electricity was actually slightly less than it was in the summers of 1999 and   1998, when electric restructuring took effect.   And yet it was not until last year that the state's wholesale electricity   market went haywire. In San Diego, the first part of the state where retail   rates were deregulated, consumer bills doubled and in some cases tripled   while the state's two largest utilities began their slide toward the brink of   bankruptcy.   A growing number of experts now say generators and traders, beginning last   summer, began exercising unfair influence over a market where the margin   between supply and demand is razor thin.   A dramatic example of how that influence is exercised would be where a power   plant owner closes a unit to decrease supply and drive prices up high enough   to make up for lost production with sales from other units. Earlier this   month, federal regulators accused two companies of doing just that in   Southern California during April and May of last year.   More common, experts say, is generators and traders offering for sale less   than a full supply of electricity so that the state is thrown into a   panic-buying situation to secure enough electricity to prevent blackouts.   \"What they are doing is perfectly legal,\" Chandler said. \"But what they are   able to do is put just enough megawatts into the market to keep the prices   high.   \"From the standpoint of supply and demand, there's enough supply in   California to meet demand, assuming we get this new generation on line and   increase energy efficiency,\" she added. \"The unknown is whether the   generators and traders are going to put electricity into the grid that is not   being controlled by contracts. That's the unknown.\"   Industry representatives vehemently deny they are doing anything but   producing all the electricity they can and putting it into the market. High   prices and shortages, they say, are simply due to the tight margin between   supply and demand, combined with the high cost of natural gas and pollution   controls.   \"In a market that's tight, if you have power chasing itself all over the   western United States, you're going to have high prices,\" said Jan   Smutny-Jones, director of the Independent Energy Producers Association.   \"We're getting tired of being the public policy pi ata here.\"   Smutny-Jones and other energy officials say they are convinced they will be   exonerated, and in the meantime they suggest investigating their activities   could prove damaging.   Blaming generators, he said, could lead generators to decide the political   and regulatory atmospheres are too unstable.   \"The supply that California needs to work its way out of this is not going to   show up, or if it does show up, it will show up with a significant premium,\"   Smutny-Jones said.   Still, accusations of unfair market practices escalated last week when the   state's grid manager, the Independent System Operator, complained to federal   regulators that generators and traders reaped $6.2 billion in excess profits.   Even the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which has been loathe to take   a strong stance in California, has recently demanded that power companies   refund tens of millions of dollars for prices the federal body says were   excessive in December and January.   \"I think the generators have gotten smarter about how to make money in the   market,\" said Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California's   Energy Institute.   Borenstein is among those who believe generators are exercising market power.   Although any given generator might own 5 percent or 6 percent of the state's   generation capacity, when margins are so tight an individual company can   spell the difference between keeping the lights on or forcing outages.   That gives those generators the power to force prices to go up artificially   high, said Borenstein.   But even some of the generators' harshest critics acknowledge that the   problem is not confined to market behavior.   The shortage is real, experts say.   And drought in the Pacific Northwest is particularly worrisome, since   Northern California relies heavily on hydroelectric dams in that region   during the summer, and transmission constraints will make it difficult, if   not impossible, to make up for that shortfall with power imports from the   Southwest.   \"Any time you have more rain in L.A. than in Seattle, you're going to have   trouble,\" said Patrick Dorinson, a spokesman at the California Independent   System Operator.   In response to worries about what the next several months will bring, the   governor has launched an intense, multi-faceted plan designed to avert   blackouts and prevent a financial catastrophe.   Davis and other Californians also have urged federal regulators to cap   wholesale prices before summer. But FERC commissioners and the Bush   administration have been opposed to price caps, saying they don't work and   would drive electricity out of the western market.   And to date, Davis' plans to minimize the damage this summer have not shown   results. His drive to secure long-term contracts has so far come up short,   and the keystone effort to buy the transmission lines of the utilities has   stalled.   Still to be determined is the success of his efforts to bring more generation   on line and encourage Californians to conserve electricity at unprecedented   levels.   Last year, San Diegans had the strongest incentive possible to conserve   electricity. They were paying the real market cost of power, and that was   doubling and in some cases tripling their electricity bills.   But San Diegans conserved only about 9 percent during that time, according to   a source at the ISO. What's more, once lawmakers recapped their electric   rates and removed their price incentive, customers of San Diego Gas &   Electric immediately reverted to their old levels of electricity use,   according to the ISO source.   Davis, meanwhile, is counting on Californians to heed his call for 10 percent   voluntary reduction in usage with no price incentive at all, except that   those who conserve an ambitious 20 percent during the entire summer will   receive a rebate.   Borenstein said the ISO's information about San Diego's electricity use last   summer is consistent with what he has seen, but he noted that the price   incentive was not as clear as it might appear.   As soon as electric bills soared, Borenstein said, politicians began   agitating customers to not pay their bills.   So consumers never really thought they were going to be punished for high   use.   He thinks it would be good to raise rates because, he said, that will reduce   consumption.   \"Rate increases, unfortunately, are not at all inevitable,\" he said. \"We   could pay for all of this through the state treasury.\"   Either way, he said, Californians will pay.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------  Calif To OK 20% Rate Hike For Utils Tue - Commissioner  By Jason Leopold  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES    03/24/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service  (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)    LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California Public Utilities Commission will   likely approve a 20% rate increase for two of the state's largest utilities   Tuesday, ending a three-year-old retail rate freeze, two PUC commissioners   told Dow Jones Newswires Saturday.   The rate hike would let the state recoup money it spent buying power since   January, said the commissioners, who asked not to be named. The increase also   would let utilities start paying small independent power producers on a   forward basis for electricity sold directly to the utilities, the   commissioners said.  PUC also may approve a trigger mechanism. The move would allow utilities PG&E   Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison International (EIX) unit   Southern California Edison additional rate increases of 5%, if needed, to   cover future power costs. Rates could go down if the future price of power   stabilizes, the commissioners said.   A PUC administrative law judge is expected to issue a proposed order that   does not support the rate increase and end to the rate freeze. As a result,   PUC Commission President Loretta Lynch is expected to issue an alternate   proposal that will call for a rate increase of about 20%, the commissioners   said.   Both proposed orders are expected to be issued Sunday afternoon.   \"There is just no way we can extract 10 cents from a nickel,\" said one   Democratic commissioner, who asked not to be named. \"Unfortunately, we are   going to have to grant the utilities an increase.\"     SoCal Ed To Present Rate Arguments Monday     The commission is expected to hear oral arguments Monday by SoCal Ed   executives regarding the company's rate stabilization plan. When first   presented to the commission in November, the plan called for a 10% rate   increase. PG&E also filed a rate stabilization plan at the time asking for a   similar increase.   Both utilities argued last November that their costs exceeded their revenues   because wholesale power prices spiked during the summer. The utilities'   customers' rates were frozen, but wholesale prices continued to soar,   surpassing the roughly 5.5 cents per kilowatt hour and 6.5 cents/KWh rate the   utilities were legally allowed to charge their customers.   In December, PG&E and SoCal Ed revised their rate stabilization plan,   requesting rate increases of as much as 30% because wholesale power prices   failed to stabilize and the utilities were getting deeper into debt. The   commission denied the request in January and approved a temporary rate   increase of 9% for residential consumers and 14% for large industrial   customers.   PG&E and SoCal Ed are now more than $13 billion in debt, have seen their   ratings downgraded to junk-status by Wall Street credit agencies and have   defaulted on billions of dollars in dividend payments, power bills and bank   loans.   Gov. Gray Davis was in Palm Springs over the weekend for a fundraiser, and   his staff was unavailable for comment. Representatives for PG&E and SoCal Ed   were also unavailable for comment.   Earlier this month, Davis told Wall Street analysts that he would not allow a   rate increase because he feared a ballot initiative by consumer advocates in   the state, who would call for an end to the state's deregulation law.   \"Believe me, if I wanted to raise rates I could have solved this problem in   20 minutes,\" Davis said at a March news conference.     Group Pledges 'Ratepayer Revolt' If Prices Rise     Harvey Rosenfield, executive director of consumer advocacy group The   Foundation of Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, promised a \"ratepayer revolt\" and   2002 ballot initiative if electricity rates are increased. Consumer advocates   are also expected to testify at Monday's hearing about why the utilities   should not be permitted to raise consumer electricity rates.   Legislative sources said the rate increase is needed so the state Department   of Water Resources, which in January started purchasing power for the   cash-strapped utilities, can be repaid. Moreover, the utilities can begin   paying the state's so-called qualifying facilities for electricity. PG&E and   SoCal Ed have not paid the QFs in full since January, and the companies owe   the generators about $1 billion.   In hindsight, one key Democratic state senator said, if the state allowed the   utilities to raise rates in January, the DWR would not have had to spend   nearly $4 billion from the general fund buying power. Further, said the   senator, who asked not to be named, the state would not have had to negotiate   a deal to buy the utilities' power lines in an effort to restore the   companies to financial stability.   \"Think about it. PG&E and Edison could have regained access to loans and   would have been able to restore their credit,\" the senator said. \"We   ultimately spent more than $5 billion than we should have if a rate increase   is approved. That's not counting, the billions of dollars more we spent and   are going to spend on long-term contracts, transmission assets and revenue   bonds. People are going to want answers and I don't know what we're going to   tell them.\"   -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;   jason.leopold@dowjones.com  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------  Few share Davis' view on rate hike: Even aides predict big power cost boost  By Dan Smith and Amy Chance  Bee Capitol Bureau  (Published March 25, 2001)   With new threats of fiscal distress descending on California's power industry   and the state treasury, Gov. Gray Davis finds himself increasingly alone in   his belief that the state can weather the energy crisis without significant   electricity rate increases.   Top lawmakers and other key officials involved in sorting through the crisis   -- including some of Davis' own staffers -- now believe rates need to rise,   perhaps to double. And they said the Public Utilities Commission is likely to   signal that some rate increase is needed when it meets this week.   \"I think the facts finally came out in terms of the magnitude of the   problem,\" said Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco. \"You   have to get the money from somewhere -- unless you steal it or win a lottery   ticket ... I don't know how you solve this problem without (a rate increase)   and I never really saw how you could solve it without one.\"   The assumptions the Democratic governor has relied on to bolster his \"hope   and expectation\" that rates won't rise beyond the already anticipated 19   percent increase are rapidly falling apart.   As the crisis drags on, the state will have to spend far more than anyone   expected in January for short-term power purchases, long-term contracts and   the utilities' transmission lines.   Davis had also hoped the state could strike a deal to rein in the costs the   utilities pay alternative energy suppliers, but by week's end suppliers were   balking and previous legislative agreements began to disintegrate.   On March 7, state Treasurer Phil Angelides had recommended the state   initially sell $10 billion in bonds to help the state purchase power, saying   a significantly larger-scale bond issue would increase costs for ratepayers.   The Senate on Thursday approved a bill it thought would make that possible.   But by Friday, neither Republican lawmakers nor the Davis administration was   on board.   Key lawmakers were told by high-level Davis staffers that the state may need   to borrow as much as $23 billion -- and raise rates by as much as 60 percent   to 80 percent above the initial 19 percent to support it -- over the next 18   to 24 months.   Davis, meanwhile, was in the Palm Springs area for most of the day Friday. As   negotiations continued in the stalemated Assembly, Davis attended a campaign   fund-raising luncheon at a top desert golf resort. His spokesman, Steve   Maviglio, said the governor did not play golf, but attended the event between   a morning groundbreaking ceremony and a mid-afternoon television interview.   \"It's insane and disgusting at this point,\" said Doug Heller of the   Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. \"Governor Davis is unfortunately   tending to his campaign coffers more effectively than he is tending to the   state's energy needs. He is double-bogeying his round as governor.\"   One administration source said some Davis advisers have been calling for a   rate increase for weeks. Maviglio said Saturday that the governor has not   been briefed on the most current financial models with which his negotiators   and legislators are working.   \"The governor has not signed off (on a rate increase),\" Maviglio said. \"What   the staff says doesn't matter. ... There's absolutely no change with what   he's said all along.\"   But others said it is time the governor confronted the reality of a rate   increase.   On Friday -- after his briefing with the administration -- Assembly Speaker   Robert Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks, said, \"it seems more inevitable that the   Public Utilities Commission will have to raise rates.\"   Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, for months a key player in the   energy talks, concluded a month ago that state   policy-makers have little ability to influence the price and availability of   power in the short term.   \"Even if the governor and the Legislature acted in perfect harmony, the   ability of state government to effectuate an outcome is very, very limited,\"   Keeley said. \"My guess is the force of events -- the enormity of the   economics involved in this -- are playing out and that the administration is   coming to the same conclusion.\"   Angelides said the numbers suggest the state can't survive financially under   the current rate structure.   \"There's a limit to how much you want to sell bonds to keep delaying   reality,\" he said. \"At the end of the day the PUC is going to have to set   rates that allow the state to buy power and the state and utilities to   recover their costs. It is certainly worth borrowing money to repay the   general fund, but then you have to ask: 'How many billions are we willing to   borrow to delay the tough reality of where we are?' \"   Heller, whose group vigorously opposes any rate increase, said he believes   Davis is politically averse to boosting voters' energy bills -- but at the   same time doesn't want to take the steps necessary to crack down hard on   energy generators, such as seizing power plants or imposing a windfall   profits tax.   That leaves the Legislature little choice, he said, but to embrace a rate   increase as necessary.   \"It's political suicide, but they have to be considering throwing this right   on (power) bills, and using blackouts as a mechanism to scare us into   accepting these rate increases,\" he said. \"The Legislature appears to be the   fall guy for the governor's weakness.\"   Keeley said Davis could help the situation -- and perhaps be viewed as   courageous -- if he publicly embraced a rate increase soon.   \"It would end the fantasy that this situation could be stabilized without a   rate increase,\" Keeley said. \"That fiction -- and the effort to maintain that   fiction -- gets in the way of genuine problem solving.\"   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------------  Rising cost of purchasing electricity sparks alarm   Posted at 11:00 p.m. PST Saturday, March 24, 2001   BY PAUL ROGERS     Mercury News     A chorus of frustration, anger and renewed calls for the state to seize   privately owned power plants echoed across California Saturday, following   news that the state might have to spend as much as $23 billion over the next   two years to buy power to keep the lights on.   ``Where do we go from here? How about off the bridge?'' said Sen. John   Burton, D-San Francisco.   ``Deregulation has been a disaster in California,'' said Assembly Speaker Pro   Tem Fred Keeley, D-Santa Cruz. ``Most of us didn't vote on this, but it is   our job to clean it up. And the cleanup is going to be awful.''   Republicans were equally gloomy.   ``The amount of money we are talking about now is so massive that most people   are shellshocked,'' said Bill Campbell, the Assembly Republican leader from   Orange.   The state's energy crisis reached a new level of anxiety among many lawmakers   Friday, after top staff members for Gov. Gray Davis told legislative leaders   that the tab for the state to buy power over the next two years might not be   $10 billion, a previous estimate, but could reach as high as $23 billion.   The new projections stem in part from the state's failure to sign enough   long-term contracts for low-cost energy, to move aggressively on an ambitious   summer energy conservation plan, and to approve a bailout for Pacific Gas &   Electric Co. and Southern California Edison.   Sources said the governor's aides estimated the rate increase for consumers   could be as high as 80 percent to cover the costs.   `Wildly speculative'   On Saturday, the governor's office did not confirm or deny the number.   ``There are a differing number of what-if scenarios being played out,'' said   Steven Maviglio, a spokesman for Davis. Maviglio called the $23 billion   estimate ``wildly speculative.''   He said Davis holds out hope that ratepayers might get ``billions of dollars   in refunds'' from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The state this   week alleged that power companies have overcharged California ratepayers by   $6.2 billion.   And he said Davis still is trying to avoid having consumers' rates go up,   something many legislators, including his fellow Democrats, now say is   unlikely.   Davis appeared briefly on a CNN television broadcast to discuss the crisis.   He did not say whether rates would have to be raised, or address the $23   billion price tag.   The two leading choices are to raise rates for consumers or sell bonds, which   would be repaid by ratepayers but would cost more over time because of   interest.   ``It seems increasingly there isn't a will in the Legislature to finance a   huge debt over time,'' said John Nelson, a spokesman for PG&E. ``I would say   a rate increase is more and more likely, whether or not it is the governor's   first choice.''   On CNN, Davis repeated calls for consumers to conserve power by at least 10   percent this summer and blamed out-of-state power generators for raising   rates to take advantage of California's flawed 1996 deregulation law.   ``They have what we need, and they are demanding very high prices for it,''   Davis said. ``It has driven our utilities to the edge of bankruptcy and   complicated our problem.''   Davis took a backhanded swipe at San Jose, a city that has blocked attempts   by Calpine Inc. to build a 600-megawatt power plant in Coyote Valley.   ``Everyone has to do their part. Cities can't be turning down plants,'' he   said.   Some were calling for more drastic measures.   Burton, the president pro tem of the state Senate, said that having the state   forcibly take over by eminent domain and buy out power plants across   California, many of them operated by Texas and other out-of-state power   companies, is looking more possible.   ``If these figures are right,'' he said, ``maybe we just go in and buy these   generation plants. If we are going to spend $20 or $30 billion, we might as   well own them.''   A bill written by Burton to create a state power authority that could build   and buy power plants passed the Senate last month and is pending in the   Assembly.   Davis broached the subject of an eminent domain takeover of power plants in   his State of the State speech in January. Since then he has said little about   the option.   Instead, Davis has tried to fix a flawed 1996 deregulation law by having the   state enter into long-term contracts to buy power for PG&E and Southern   California Edison. The two utilities say they have lost more than $13 billion   since last summer and now teeter on the verge of bankruptcy because they have   been forced to pay high wholesale electricity costs, and California's 1996   deregulation law prevents them from raising rates.   Consumer advocates on Saturday were unequivocal, however.   ``It's time to get the pitchforks and go to the Bastille,'' said Nettie Hoge,   director of The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco. ``You have to put it   at the feet of the people who are doing the generating -- the Texas and   Southern companies.''   Hoge said that California residents are in for ``certain blackouts'' this   summer when energy demand outstrips supply. And with power bills likely to   rise, she said interest is already high in crafting a ballot measure for 2002   for the state to take over the power plants.   ``What you have is a huge black hole of generator greed. We have almost   burned through the state surplus. Somebody has got to put on the brakes,''   she said.   Power producers, however, said that solution would be ill-advised.   ``We would vigorously defend our interests,'' said Tom Williams, spokesman   for Duke Energy. ``You can't seize property without fair market value. It is   against the law.''   Duke has bought four power plants since 1998, paying $611 million. The   company has already begun a $1.6 billion effort to upgrade and expand the   plants, which include former PG&E facilities at Moss Landing and Morro Bay.   If the state seized the plants, long court battles would ensue. Williams said   Duke's plants are worth far more than what the firm paid for them, and the   state would lose tens of millions of dollars in tax revenue.   Opposition to seizures   Republicans in Sacramento have opposed seizing power plants, saying it will   discourage new construction. Campbell said Saturday that if rates have to be   raised, he favors using the state's surplus for a $6 billion or more tax cut.   The state Public Utilities Commission is to take up the rate hike on Tuesday.   So far, the PUC has raised retail electricity rates only 9 percent since the   crisis began.   One Democratic leader, Keeley, agreed that costs would be so high for the   state to seize power plants it might not be worthwhile. He said the state   should stay the course, and can get by with rate increases, issuing bonds for   some of the costs and continuing to permit the construction of new power   plants.   Keeley also said for the first time Saturday that he is no longer opposed to   letting PG&E or Southern California Edison go bankrupt. It may be cheaper, he   said, for the state to take over those companies -- and the one-third of   California's power they produce -- than continuing to help bail them out.   Will Davis agree to more radical notions like seizing power plants or   allowing bankruptcy of the state's venerable utilities?   One political observer said he will do what the public wants, especially as   his re-election in November 2002 nears.   ``Gray Davis wants the lights on until the day after the election,'' said   Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a senior scholar at the School of Policy, Planning and   Development at the University of Southern California. ``He is a political   pragmatist. You do what you need to do.''  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------  Bond may fall short, Davis aides fear  Governor holds out hope of keeping a lid on rates    By Ed Mendel   STAFF WRITER   March 25, 2001     SACRAMENTO -- Gov. Gray Davis' administration is concerned that a planned $10   billion bond issue may fall short of covering power costs, and some think   utility customers will be hit with a hefty rate increase.   But a spokesman said yesterday that Davis continues to say his \"hope and   expectation\" is that the electricity crisis can be solved without an increase   in the existing rate structure.   \"He said there is absolutely no change in what he has been saying all along,\"   said Steve Maviglio, Davis' press secretary.   Maviglio said the administration asked the Assembly on Friday to delay action   on a bill that would limit the bond issue to $10 billion while \"some   cash-flow issues\" are studied.   A Davis energy adviser, Joseph Fichera of Saber Partners, said the   administration is studying \"various scenarios\" based on payments to small   generators, long-term power contracts, the price of natural gas used by   generators and the cost of buying power on the spot market this summer.   \"We wouldn't be good analysts if we didn't vary assumptions widely on our   inputs to try to see what comes out of them,\" Fichera said.   Maviglio denied reports that the governor's top aides have concluded that a   rate increase is necessary.   \"We have one anonymous staff (member) saying that,\" he said. \"I can tell you   from my meetings the whole staff isn't sold on it.\"   The state began buying power for utility customers in mid-January after a   failed deregulation plan drove Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern   California Edison Co. to the brink of bankruptcy.   The rates the utilities could charge their customers were frozen as the cost   of wholesale power soared, producing what the utilities say is a combined   debt of nearly $13 billion.   The state has been spending about $1.5 billion a month from the general fund   to buy power, and $4.2 billion has been earmarked for power purchases so far.   The plan is to repay the general fund with bonds paid off by utility   customers.   The state Treasurer's Office had hoped to obtain a $5 billion, short-term   \"bridge\" loan by the end of this month, which would provide funds until the   $10 billion bond could be issued at the end of May.   The lawmaker who carried the legislation authorizing the bond issue,   Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, has said from the outset that a   rate increase is likely, despite the governor's hope to the contrary.   Now new estimates of what the state may have to spend to buy power during the   next two years reportedly are as high as $23 billion. The concern is that   paying off a bond of that size would force a substantial rate increase.   Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, was pessimistic about avoiding   a rate increase as he spoke with reporters Friday after the Assembly   adjourned for the weekend.   \"I don't think so,\" Hertzberg said when asked if a rate increase could be   avoided. But he quickly added, \"I don't know yet.\"   The governor wants to use the existing rate to pay off not only the bond to   buy power, but a second large bond issue to pay off the massive debt of the   utilities as part of the state purchase of their transmission systems.   The Public Utilities Commission may consider a proposal Tuesday to reallocate   revenue from the bills paid by utility customers, giving the state the   \"California procurement adjustment\" needed to pay off the power bond.   Davis also wants the PUC on Tuesday to order PG&E and Edison to begin paying   small, non-utility generators in the federal \"qualifying facilities\" program   that provide about one-quarter of the state's power.   A number of the small generators have quit operating, contributing to rolling   blackouts early last week. Edison has not paid the small generators since   November, and PG&E has only paid 15 percent of what they are owed.   But paying the small generators, while providing revenue to pay off two large   bond issues, strains the existing rate structure. PG&E warned Friday that it   may file a lawsuit if the PUC does not leave enough of the rate revenue for   the utility to pay its bills.   The bill that would limit the power bond to $10 billion also contained a   provision that would no longer require that payments to small generators be   based on the price of natural gas, which has soared in recent months.   Small generators who use gas turbines oppose the change, warning that it   would put them out of business. A third part of the bill would cap the rates   for businesses served by San Diego Gas & Electric Co.   Negotiators meeting over the weekend are expected to place the bond limit,   the small-generator provision and the SDG&E business-rate cap in three   separate bills.  ",

F & G - A comment data field for operational capacity updates was added to TMS around the 13th or 14th of August. The way this field works is as follows: If the Operational Capacity Volume is updated during the allocation process, the reps. must enter a comment. TMS is now storing the comments. Also, the operational capacity changes made during the I/D 1 and I/D 2 cycles do not get sent back to CAS, so we should not have the issue with the flow rate calculation being posted as operational capacity. The CAS system is also tracking comments if the reps. update the operational capacity in that system. Basically the comments could be stored in both systems. If you need this data, we will need to go the Tina Dunnaway for CAS or Hasan Kedwaii for TMS.   Let me know if you need anything or if I can help coordinate getting this information.

I have kept Dale in a state of fiddling with this report for two months now.   For example, my notes from our meeting reflect the fact that we decided against trend information.  I am certainly willing to change that decision if you guys collectively agree.  Have you considered whether we need different types of reports rather than try to accomplish all on this page.  The purpose of the current page is for gas logistics to report on what is happening on the system (i.e. how the physical world is tracking to the paper world).   We need to run through this exercise from a gas logistics side each day even if it isn't meaningful to marketing.  I'm not adverse to the concept of studying shifts in gas flows from day-day or year-year, but perhaps this is a distinct analytical tool.  Hopefully we can work out these details on Tues & then run with it.",

The above referenced fields have been a challenge to get  the data base populated as needed.  But this group has done an excellent job in striving to give us an accurate report and not giving up on possibilities.  As you are aware, Gary and Darrell have already started using the report and we have changed how we report outages and allocations.  Storage will change once the new report is completed.    Don Powell and Dale Ratliff have been an excellent resource and very helpful to ensure we get the product we need.    If you have any other questions or any concerns about not getting the new report before June 15th, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn",

When I spoke with Ginger a few days ago, she said that she thought we would travel 10 days or so after the Almaty group, probably in late November.    After I get off the phone I always think of  questions I should have asked.  Since my questions are not critical, but process in nature, I thought I'd drop an email.   I am unclear about the steps that need to happen between now and travel.  How long does translation take?  What happens after that?  When is the dossier sent to Kazakstan?  Typically, how much notice are people given of their Kazak court date?  I would also like to get your views on the likelihood of the process slipping such that our travel would fall over the Christmas holiday -- as that would present some childcare concerns for me back in Houston.   Sorry for so many questions.  I know that you are both very busy and I know that patience is definitely in order with this process.  I am just so very new to this international adoption process and want to make certain that I am realistic about the steps involved.  Shelley Corman 713-853-7083",

This credits the proposed Enron Grandfathering plan to have the remainder of  the time to Oct. 15, 2001 in which to achieve full activation of the written  plans within each of the Enron companies.  While there are substantial numbers of law suits filed over this final rule,  the outlook for any satisfactory court action is unlikely, as is action from  Congress. Any repeal actions from a new OSHA administration would likely take  longer than Oct. 15, 2001 to become effective.   Russ ",

We'll be reviewing the room layouts and the activation and setup process. I would expect to be back in the office by 1PM, but no later than 2PM.  Please make arrangements with your team for car pooling out. It would be good practice to drive out if you haven't been out to the Hangar before.",

		"_body" : "Friends & Family,  My cousin sent this to me today and I know it touched me. How would our children react to this situation?  I pray they would do the same. I pray this is what we are teaching them, love and humanity.     Subject: FW: Food For Thought  Don't look for a punch line. There isn't one. Read it anyway. My question to all of you is: Would you have made the same choice?  At a fundraising dinner for a school that serves learning disabled children, the father of one of the students delivered a speech that would never be forgotten by all who attended. After extolling the school and its dedicated staff, he offered a question. \"When not interfered with by outside influences, everything nature does is done with perfection. Yet my son, Shay cannot learn things as other children do. He cannot understand things as other children do Where is the natural order of things in my son?\" The audience was stilled by the query. The father continued. \"I believe, that when a child like Shay comes into the world, an opportunity to realize true human nature presents itself, and it comes, in the way other people treat that child.\" Then he told the followingstory:  Shay and his father had walked past a park where some boys Shay knew were playing baseball. Shay asked, \"Do you think they'll let me play?\"  Shay's father knew that most of the boys would not want someone like Shay on their team, but the father also understood that if his son were allowed to play, it would give him a much-needed sense of belonging. Shay's father approached one of the boys on the field and asked if Shay could play. The boy looked around for guidance and, getting none, he took matters into his own hands and said, \"We're losing by six runs and the game is in the eighth inning. I guess he can be on our team and we'll try to put him in to bat in the ninth inning.\" In the bottom of the eighth inning, Shay's team scored a few runs but was still behind by three. In the top of the ninth inning, Shay put on a glove and played in the outfield. Even though no hits came his way, he was obviously ecstatic just to be! in the game and on the field, grinning from ear to ear as his father waved to him from the stands.  In the bottom of the ninth inning, Shay's team scored again. Now, with two outs and the bases loaded, the potential winning run was on base and Shay was scheduled to be next at bat. At this juncture, let Shay bat and give away their chance to win the game?  Surprisingly, Shay was given the bat. Everyone knew that a hit was all but impossible cause Shay didn't even know how to hold the bat properly, much less connect with the ball. However, as Shay stepped up to the plate, the pitcher moved in a few steps to lob the ball in softly so Shay could at least be able to make contact. The first pitch came and Shay swung clumsily and missed. The pitcher again took a few steps forward to toss the ball softly towards Shay. As the pitch came in, Shay swung at the ball and hit a slow ground ball right back to the pitcher. The pitcher picked! up the soft grounder and could have easily thrown the ball to the first baseman. Shay would have been out and that would have been the end of the game. Instead, the pitcher took the ball and turned and threw the ball on a high arc to right field, far beyond the reach of the first baseman. Everyone started yelling,\" Shay, run to first! Run to first!\"  Never in his life had Shay ever made it to first base. He scampered down the baseline, wide-eyed and startled; Everyone yelled, \"Run to second, run to second!\" By the time Shay rounded first base, the right fielder had the ball. He could have thrown the ball to the second-baseman for the tag, but he understood the pitcher's intentions and intentionally threw the ball high and far over the third-baseman's head. Shay ran toward second base as the runners ahead of him deliriously circled the bases toward home.  Shay reached second base, the opposing shortstop ran to him, turned h! im in the direction of third base, and shouted, \"Run to third!\" As Shay rounded third, the boys from both teams were screaming, \"Shay, run home!\" Shay ran to home, stepped on the plate, and was cheered as the hero who hit the \"grand slam\" and won the game for his team.\"That day,\" said the father softly with tears now rolling down his face, \"the boys from both teams helped bring a piece of true love and humanity into this world.\"  AND, NOW A LITTLE FOOTNOTE TO THIS STORY:  We all send thousands of jokes through the e-mail without a second thought, but when it comes to sending messages about life choices, people think twice about sharing. The crude, vulgar, and often obscene pass freely through cyberspace, but public discussion about decency is too often suppressed in our schools and workplaces. If you're thinking about forwarding this message, chances are that you're probably sorting out the people on your address list that a! ren't the \"appropriate\" ones to receive this type of message. Well, the person who sent you this believes that we all can make a difference. We all have thousands of opportunities every single day to help realize the \"natural order of things.\"  So many seemingly trivial interactions between two people present us with a choice:  Do we pass along a little spark of love and humanity or do we pass up that opportunity, and leave the world a little bit colder in the process?        _____    Do You Yahoo!?

Apparently the alarm and the intercom were not functioning and she had no way of notifying anyone that she was stuck between the 39th floor and the plaza. After other dispatchers became concerned about her being missing and searched for her, it was 2 hours before they determined she was stuck in an elevator. It then took another 3 hours to repair the elevator and get her out. We were advised by one of the guards that the weekly test and inspection of the intercoms was not performed on Saturday, as scheduled.

		"_body" : "The FERC is presently deliberating on more restrictive rules, but I'll answer in the context of the current rules.  There are three main principles behind the current rules: 1. Pipeline can't share shipper information with affiliate 2. Pipeline can't share transportation info with affiliate -- unless pipeline is willing to publicly post info, and 3. Pipeline and affiliates must operate as separately as reasonably possible.  There is no prohibition on the pipeline having affiliate information, but the real root of your question is whether the entities are operating separately.  For example, pipeline gets forward price curve info from affiliate -- we'd argue that this is just info that helps pipeline do its job better.  But, compare with scenario where pipeline has a detailed list of all affiliates sales obligations - price, terms, etc. -- the argument can be made that the entities are not operating separately and the only reason that the pipe has this info is to favor affiliate business.  There was a real case to this effect.  The pipeline & affiliate attended a joint strategy meeting each morning.  The pipeline claimed that it only listened during the meeting.  FERC found that the pipeline and affiliate were not operating separately and fined the pipeline.  So, I'd say that the rules are asymmetric for the case where the pipeline wants access to research/training/historical type info, but probably symmetric when it comes to matters of day to day contracts of transactions.",

We miss her terribly and are counting the days until we can bring her home.  We're certainly not looking forward to travel at this time, and even less happy about leaving our 6-year old son home while we are out of country, but we are resolved to bring Alina home -- the sooner, the better.  Based on conversations with Ginger and Chris, it sounds like we may face the travel adventure at the same time -- although I'm not sure when.  We have completed our dossier (although I haven't sent the originals to Ginger); completed our home study & sent into INS recently; and we've already done the INS fingerprinting.  So I guess the next steps are INS approval, shipping stuff off to Kazakstan, and getting our Kazakstan visas.  One of the hardest parts of the Kidsave program is not being able to communicate with the kids when they return.  She is in the Ulan orphanage in Taraz.  Alina speaks only Kazak, no Russian, so I'm not sure how I'd communicate with her long distance even if I had an address or phone number.  Fortunately I have received periodic emails from Larissa, the escort that came to Houston with the children this summer.  Her husband, Sergei, has been to visit the children in Taraz & she sent me a picture of Alina.  Sorry to ramble so.  I'm anxious to talk to you about your child, your travel plans, possibilities for hiring an escort, etc.  Please feel free to call or email me anytime.  Here is my contact info.

TMS generates cut notices after each scheduling cycle and with extended outages of mailman.enron.com, we are losing a critical channel of communication to customers.  Customers rely on these messages to inform them of business changes.  In addition, ETS critical notices generated by X-12 cannot be sent out during these periods.  They are called \"critical notices\" because of the immediacy of when a customer needs to react.     I do think we need to know the following:    1.  Could a message generated by TMS cause further infection of the e-mail systems? 2.  Can the critical notices cause further infection of Enron's e-mail systems?     3.  Is it possible to keep outbound messages from systems other than Exchange flowing during virus interruptions?    This is a significant reliability issue and ETS customer communications were disrupted for approximately 8 hours yesterday.  Please let me know how we should proceed.     ",

I am anxious to correspond with her and see where she is in the process and her thoughts about travel plans.   I know that the adoption agency wants to group the Taraz families together for court dates/travel.  One of the other Houston families (Swangos) has made progress on their dossier and turned in their INS approval.  The other (the Westbrooks) haven't yet applied for passports or begun their dossier.  I want to be very supportive and accomodate all the families -- after all the goal line is home for all these children.  At the same time, I need to form realistic concepts of likely timeframes for our family.  I think talking to Liz will be helpful on this front.   Thanks for all your help.  After you make the homestudy changes noted below you will resend to Gwyn?  Then she'll send to me to send to INS?  Probably sometime next week?

With the stock market telling Dynegy Inc. that energy trader Enron Corp. isn't worth even half what Dynegy has offered to pay, analysts and investors are paying close attention to the circumstances under which Dynegy could bargain a lower price or even walk away from the merger deal.   Earlier this month, Houston-based Dynegy offered to buy its far larger cross-town rival in an all-stock deal that currently values Enron shares at $10.85 apiece, or a total of about $9.2 billion. But in the wake of post-agreement disclosures by Enron that its future earnings are likely to be substantially less than expected, the company's stock has been hammered. In 1 p.m. trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, Enron shares fell 30 cents to $4.71. The stock is down 94% so far this year and far short of the per-share takeover price. Dynegy shares rose 64 cents to $40.40.  Although Dynegy and Enron both say they are going ahead with the deal under the terms negotiated, Dynegy does appear to have other options. The agreement with Enron contains a broad \"material adverse change\" clause as well as some specific trigger points that could be invoked.   Dynegy officials performed \"due diligence\" throughout the holiday weekend, seeking to learn more about the intimate workings of Enron, which has suffered a series of damaging blows. Since mid-October, Enron has disclosed that some of its officers participated in personally enriching deals that moved assets off Enron's balance sheet, for a time, to several private partnerships. Those deals are now the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. Past treatment of some of those deals has been termed an \"accounting error\" by Enron and it twice has rejiggered its earnings since Oct. 16. At one point, Enron restated downwards nearly five years of earnings.   An Enron spokeswoman said the company was proceeding in the belief that the deal would be completed as agreed. Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said the two sides are forging ahead although he acknowledged that the walk-away provisions \"are broad, by design, to ensure adequate protection for Dynegy shareholders.\" Shareholders of both firms must still vote on the merger agreement.   Clauses related to a \"material adverse change,\" also known as a \"material adverse effect,\" have been the focus of much attention among merger professionals this year, due, in part, to the stock market's fluctuations and the economic slowdown that have caused some buyers to reconsider planned acquisitions.   But such clauses rarely are invoked by a buyer or seller because they are considered extremely difficult to prove. Both parties typically are reluctant to lay out specific terms for canceling a deal, much the way a bride and groom often balk at negotiating a prenuptial agreement since it appears to envisage a breakup of the marriage even before it begins.   Furthermore, a key court case earlier this year affirmed widespread views that a buyer can't easily walk away from a merger. In that case, meat-processing concern Tyson Foods Inc. sought to cancel a planned acquisition of meat-packer IBP Inc. due to a drop in IBP's earnings and a write-down of an IBP subsidiary. But a Delaware judge refused to let Tyson cancel the pact, saying Tyson had been aware of the cyclical nature of IBP's business and the accounting issue.   In a lengthy June 18 opinion, Delaware Chancery Court Vice Chancellor Leo E. Strine Jr. wrote that \" . . . the important thing is whether the company has suffered a Material Adverse Effect in its business or results of operations that is consequential to the company's earnings power over a commercially reasonable period, which one would think would be measured in years rather than months.\"   That interpretation has created ripples in the deal-making community, prompting some transactions to include more details about circumstances under which deals can be terminated. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, for example, a handful of merger agreements have specified that future terrorist activity would qualify as a \"material adverse change,\" or MAC.   A key issue for any firm alleging there has been a material adverse change is \"whether the new facts go to the guts of the strategic opportunity or is it just a hiccup,\" says Meredith Brown, co-chairman of the mergers and acquisitions group at law firm Debevoise & Plimpton in New York. He adds that a court \"may be skeptical\" if Dynegy claimed that Enron's post-merger agreement disclosures were a surprise.   The Enron-Dynegy merger agreement includes several triggers permitting either side to seek termination. Enron can quit the deal if it receives a substantially better offer, although it is prohibited from soliciting one. In such a case, it could be required to pay a $350 million \"topper fee\" to Dynegy and its co-investor, ChevronTexaco Inc.   Dynegy can alter the deal if Enron faces \"pending or threatened\" litigation liabilities that are \"reasonably likely\" to cost Enron $2 billion. If those liabilities hit $3.5 billion \"an Enron material event will be deemed to have occurred,\" presumably allowing Dynegy to call the whole thing off. In some situations, Dynegy would be liable for a $350 million fee, as well.   Karen Denne, the Enron spokeswoman, said her firm doesn't believe that losses arising from the normal course of business would qualify as a material event. The liability must result from litigation. Currently, the company faces more than a dozen shareholder suits alleging breach of fiduciary duty by officers and directors, issuing false and misleading reports and other offenses.   Deal makers who aren't involved in the combination say the steep drop in Enron's stock price since the merger agreement was signed wouldn't by itself give Dynegy the ability to cancel the pact or force Enron to renegotiate its terms. Instead, they say, Dynegy would likely have to prove that Enron's worsening financial condition was an unanticipated event, which could be difficult in light of the company's highly publicized problems and Dynegy's frequent statement that it clearly understands Enron's businesses. Still, there is another standard clause in the merger document that would allow Dynegy to terminate the deal if \"any representation or warranty of Enron shall have become untrue.\"   Other energy companies have abandoned deals following a widening gap in stock prices that changed an acquisition premium. Western Resources Inc. of Topeka, Kansas last week sued Public Service Co. of New Mexico seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages after it failed to buy Western's utilities. The lawsuit accused Public Service of breaching its \"duty of good faith and fair dealing\" and said the New Mexico company tried to \"sabotage\" the deal as the two companies' stock prices diverged. Public Service denies the accusations.    Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.      Options Report  Volatility Fell Slightly in Light Holiday Trading As Enron Calls, Lilly Puts Attracted Interest  By Cheryl Winokur Munk  Dow Jones Newswires    11/26/2001  The Wall Street Journal  B8  (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)    NEW YORK -- The options market dozed, as many participants stayed home to recover from too much turkey and football.   The Chicago Board Options Exchange's market volatility index, or VIX, which measures certain Standard & Poor's 100 Index option prices to gauge investor sentiment, remained in a tight range during the abbreviated trading session the day after Thanksgiving. It fell 0.53 to 24.79.  VIX typically ranges between 20 and 30. A rise indicates traders and money managers are becoming anxious about the stock market; a fall shows investor optimism.   Volatility has been dropping from post-Sept. 11 levels in recent weeks amid victories over the Taliban in Afghanistan and interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and other central banks. VIX ranged between 30 and 40 for several weeks following the attacks.   Volatility is likely to remain low, said Mika Toikka, head of options strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston. \"Typically, going into the Thanksgiving and December holidays, we tend to experience a seasonal drift lower in implied volatility. We would expect the same this year, especially in markets outside the U.S. where volatility is still lingering at high levels,\" Mr. Toikka wrote in a recent research note.   The CBOE's Nasdaq Volatility index, or VXN, a sentiment barometer for the technology sector, fell 1.86 to 50.82 while the American Stock Exchange's Nasdaq volatility index, or QQV, dropped 1.03 to 42.74.   Elsewhere in the options market:   Calls in Enron Corp., the embattled Houston energy and trading company, continued to trade briskly, with one investor buying 10,000 January 5 calls and simultaneously selling 12,250 January 10 calls.   More than 14,800 of the January 5 contracts traded, compared with open interest of 3,640, as shares fell 33 cents, or 6.6%, to $4.68. These calls cost $1.40 on the American Stock Exchange where most of the volume was traded.   More than 15,000 of the January 10 contracts traded, compared with open interest of 30,674. These out-of-the-money calls cost 30 cents on the Amex.   Eli Lilly & Co.'s December 80 out-of-the-money puts also were popular Friday, as shares fell 91 cents, or 1.1%, to $82.42. Morgan Stanley cut its rating on the company to neutral from outperform, saying the stock has become too expensive even with Food and Drug Administration approval of its potential blockbuster drug Xigris, which treats septic infections. More than 3,000 of these puts traded, compared with open interest of 6,427. They cost $1.25 on the CBOE, which saw much of the volume.    Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.        The Corporation: Acquisitions  The Other Instant Powerhouse in Energy Trading  By Louise Lee in San Mateo, Calif.    11/26/2001  BusinessWeek  96  (Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)    It's not easy being No. 4. Despite a $35 billion merger completed in October, ChevronTexaco Corp. is still not one of the oil superpowers. Nor, at more than $90 billion a year in revenues, is it a scrappy little guy. So Chairman David J. O'Reilly has been searching for a strategy beyond just drilling for more oil and gas.   Now, he may have something: a big stake in the No. 1 energy-trading company. Chevron Corp. has owned 26% of Dynegy Inc. since 1996, and with Dynegy's planned acquisition of Enron Corp., the top energy trader, ChevronTexaco is making the oil industry's most aggressive push yet into this fast-growing business. It plans to eventually pump $2.5 billion into the combined Dynegy and Enron to maintain its 26% stake, and it might raise that share. So, while ChevronTexaco's much bigger rivals run small in-house trading operations, energy trading may soon account for more than 10% of ChevronTexaco's earnings. ``Chevron is now positioned to be a leader in the business,'' says analyst Arjun Murti at Goldman, Sachs & Co.  The deal would certainly dovetail with ChevronTexaco's strategy of becoming a more integrated energy company, with a hand in everything from pumping oil at the wellhead to trading natural-gas futures. By acquiring Texaco, Chevron picked up, for instance, a big refining-and-marketing business --which should balance out the bad times in oil and gas production, says Eugene Nowak, an analyst at ABN Amro. ``When crude-oil prices are down, they'll have margin improvements on refining and marketing,'' he says. O'Reilly and other ChevronTexaco executives declined to comment.   Until now, Dynegy wasn't a big deal for Chevron. Chevron purchased the stake for $700 million when Dynegy was still called NGC Corp., and it filled three of the 14 board seats--positions it will keep. Since then, Chevron has sold nearly all its domestic natural-gas production to Dynegy. The stake has been a good investment: it is now worth $3 billion, ChevronTexaco says.   Sitting on $2.9 billion in cash as of the end of the second quarter, ChevronTexaco can well afford the Dynegy deal, analysts say. And they expect O'Reilly to use some of that to make more buys; the most likely target is a natural-gas company. Maybe it's not so bad being No. 4.

The Corporation: Acquisitions  ALL EYES ON THE ENRON PRIZE If the deal holds, Dynegy will walk away with some juicy assets  By Stephanie Anderson Forest, with Wendy Zellner in Dallas, and Peter Coy and Emily Thornton in New York    11/26/2001  BusinessWeek  94  (Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)    As Houston-based Enron Corp. imploded amid a dizzying scandal over its finances, few would have blamed Dynegy Inc. CEO Charles L. Watson if he had sat back and gloated. After all, Watson had watched as his bigger, brasher crosstown rival sniffed at Dynegy's more cautious strategy, all the while garnering most of the credit for reshaping the energy-trading business.   Instead, Watson picked up the phone on Oct. 24 and called Enron Chairman, CEO, and longtime acquaintance Kenneth L. Lay to ask how he could help. Lay didn't respond immediately, but as Enron's stock continued to plunge and the company faced a cash squeeze, it became clear what the only realistic answer could be: Bail us out.  So two days later, Lay invited Watson to his River Oaks home near downtown Houston for breakfast to discuss a deal. Over muffins and ``a bad cup of coffee'' the next day, Watson recalls, they sketched the outlines, and by 10 p.m. that night, the investment bankers were called in. On Nov. 9, Dynegy announced that it would pay about $10 billion, plus the assumption of $13 billion in debt, to buy Enron, which is nearly four times its size. The key to the deal was Dynegy's immediate $1.5 billion infusion of cash to shore up Enron's balance sheet and save its credit rating. The money came from Dynegy's 26% owner, ChevronTexaco Corp.   Without that help, Enron--the seventh-largest U.S. company, based on its $100 billion in sales last year--may well have faced bankruptcy. Watson says that he never would have imagined such an outcome in his wildest dreams. ``I don't think anybody foresaw the problems [at Enron],'' he says. ``It's been incredible to watch.''   Watson, 51, has to make good on what may well be his riskiest investment yet. If he can pull it off, the new Dynegy will have revenues of more than $200 billion and $90 billion in assets, including more than 22,000 megawatts of power-generating capacity and 25,000 miles of pipeline. It would control an estimated 20% to 25% of the energy-trading market, up from about 6% now.   That would be sweet vindication for Watson's strategy. Dynegy backs trading operations with hard assets such as power plants, which allows the company to guarantee a supply of electricity to a buyer. In contrast, Enron has worked furiously to shed power plants and oil- and gas-generating fields, believing it could earn higher returns using its trading and technology expertise to tap assets owned by others in markets including steel, pulp, and paper. IRRESISTIBLE BARGAIN. As Enron's stock slid below $9 from its August, 2000, high of $90, it became a bargain that Watson couldn't pass up. It would have taken years for Dynegy to build up a market-making operation to match Enron's. Its risk-management systems are top-of-the-line. Enron's commercial-services unit, which manages power supplies for corporate customers such as Wendy's International Inc., is three or four years ahead of Dynegy's, says Steve Bergstrom, president of Dynegy. Watson says he still plans to get rid of the $8 billion worth of assets Lay had earmarked for sale, including the Portland (Ore.) General Electric plant and oil and gas assets in India. For the $1.5 billion, though, if the deal falls through Dynegy will have the right to Enron's prized Northern Natural Gas pipeline, worth an estimated $2.25 billion. And Dynegy can walk away if Enron's legal liabilities exceed $3.5 billion.   Watson firmly believes that Enron suffered from a crisis of confidence, not a meltdown of its core business. Indeed, Enron's wholesale-trading operation earned $2.3 billion last year. Says Watson: ``We know the business. We looked under the hood, and guess what? It's just as strong as we thought it was.''   But the trading profits were obscured in recent weeks by Enron's accounting tricks. The biggest danger for Watson is that there are other time bombs ticking away. Already, the company has slashed its reported earnings since 1997 by $591 million, or 20% of its total, to account for controversial partnerships involving Enron officials. The Securities & Exchange Commission is still investigating. ``We believe it will take more than just a couple of weeks and a long-term relationship [between Watson and Lay] to do all the necessary due diligence,'' says analyst Carol Coale of Prudential Securities Inc. Dynegy's Bergstrom counters: ``We're pretty certain that most everything of material consideration has been disclosed.'' If not? The massive earnings boost provides ``a high margin of error,'' he says. A WANNABE. Of course, regulators may object to the concentration of trading operations. And Watson will have to mesh two very different cultures. Enron is known for its intense, even cutthroat entrepreneurial spirit. Dynegy's operations are more conservative; some compare it to a fraternity. Dynegy's decision to issue new stock options to some Enron employees may soothe battered egos. It should help, too, that Lay decided not to take the $60 million golden parachute he could have received in a buyout. As it is, Lay will not have a management job with the new company.   Dynegy often seemed to be an Enron wannabe, following it into online trading and commercial services. Still, Dynegy's 361% stock gains last year eclipsed Enron's 87% rise, and it rankled some that Lay's execs got more credit. ``Chuck Watson may not have been in the spotlight, but he has always been at the forefront of this business,'' says Bruce M. Withers, who sold his Trident NGL Inc. to Dynegy in 1995. Watson will get more attention next year--he's a 15% owner of the new Houston Texans pro football team. But with his bold takeover of Enron, Watson has ensured that he's off the sidelines for good.    Photograph: DYNEGY'S WATSON He says Enron's core business is strong.

ATLAS    11/22/2001   The New York Times   Page 1, Column 2   c. 2001 New York Times Company   Officials of Dynegy yesterday weighed whether to seek to renegotiate the terms of the company's agreement to acquire Enron, its Houston rival, while Enron and its bankers sought to shore up its finances, executives close to the two companies said.   The discussions came as the stock and energy markets continued to register doubts about the financial stability of Enron, the energy trading concern. Enron's stock fell another 27 percent, even though the company won a three-week reprieve from its banks on a $690 million note that would have come due next Tuesday if Enron had been unable to come up with collateral.   An executive close to Enron described the loan extension, by J. P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup, as a Band-Aid, given the approach of Thanksgiving. ''People are trying to take the time to come up with something for the intermediate term,'' the executive added.   The bankers also met with investors, including leveraged buyout firms and two industrial companies, which might inject up to $2 billion into Enron under arrangements that would protect them from a further collapse in the company's stock, the executives said.   The new investments would be in Enron's Transwestern Pipeline, which links natural gas fields in Texas to the California market, they said. The deals would be structured like Dynegy's agreement, as part of the merger, to infuse $1.5 billion into the Enron subsidiary that owns the Northern Natural Gas pipeline. That arrangement lets Dynegy keep the pipeline even if the merger falls apart.   Besides talking with other potential investors, J. P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup agreed to terms that have each taking a $250 million equity stake in such a deal, the executives said. The bankers plan to meet with Enron officials on Monday to complete the transactions, they added.   Karen Denne, an Enron spokeswoman, noted that the company had previously said it was seeking a further infusion of up to $1 billion in equity. ''We are not going to discuss the specifics of who we are talking to,'' she said.   Though investors again manhandled the stock of Enron, which is down 94 percent this year, the banks, Dynegy and credit-rating agencies all sought to proceed delicately. Executives explained that hasty moves could only deepen the crisis of confidence in Enron, wiping out the energy trading operations that only months ago made it one of the nation's most admired and politically influential companies.   Dynegy officials worried yesterday that even talking about renegotiating the merger deal could damage confidence in Enron among investors and other energy traders.   An executive close to Dynegy said that there did not yet appear to be legal grounds on which to break up the deal unilaterally. Nor, he added, was Dynegy prepared to demand that Enron allow the terms of the deal to be changed. But he indicated that the situation could change.   Ms. Denne, the Enron spokeswoman, said that she was not aware of any attempts by Dynegy to renegotiate the deal. Dynegy issued a statement saying that its chief executive, Chuck Watson, was encouraged by the steps Enron had taken with its bankers. Mr. Watson said the company was continuing its due diligence on the deal.   Dynegy's shares, which rose as high as $46.94 in the days after the merger was announced, on Nov. 9, closed yesterday at $39.76, down more than 4 percent for the second consecutive day.   Enron was the most actively traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at $5.01, down $1.98. That means the premium that Dynegy would be paying for Enron has risen to 115 percent.   Analysts following Enron's debt said that bankers had little choice but to support the company, given that most of Enron's bank debt is not secured. That means that if bankers pushed Enron into bankruptcy, they would receive no better treatment than the holders of more than $6 billion in Enron bonds and other debt.   Enron said it was in talks with lenders to restructure $9.15 billion in debt that will come due by the end of 2002. ''If the Dynegy deal closed, that would be the best thing for the banks,'' said one analyst following the debt.   James B. Lee Jr., vice chairman of J. P. Morgan Chase, echoed that thought in a statement issued by Enron. ''We believe the interests of Chase and Enron's other primary lenders are aligned in this restructuring effort,'' he said. ''We will work with Enron and its other primary lenders to develop a plan to strengthen Enron's financial position up to and through its merger with Dynegy.'' Along with Citigroup, J. P. Morgan Chase is Enron's lead bank, and it is also an adviser on the merger with Dynegy.   Another group with the power to push Enron to the brink, the big credit-rating agencies, continued to step gingerly. The agencies have held Enron's debt rating one step above ''junk'' status, knowing that downgrading it further would force the company to pay or refinance up to $3.9 billion in debt -- effectively rendering Enron insolvent. One rating agency official said yesterday that such a move would roil the entire debt market, adding that it was ''patriotic'' to hold off.   Still, one rating agency, Fitch, put out a strongly worded commentary yesterday.   ''If Dynegy steps away entirely from the merger, Enron's credit situation seems untenable, with a bankruptcy filing highly possible,'' wrote Ralph Pellecchia and Glen Grabelsky, the Fitch analysts following Enron. ''Our present BBB- rating rests on the merger possibility and continued support of the lending banks, without which Fitch would consider lowering the rating.''   Analysts and energy executives said that Enron's collapse -- though unthinkable just weeks ago -- would be unlikely to cause a meltdown in the nation's energy markets. While Enron has been the nation's biggest trader of electric power and natural gas, many other companies -- including Dynegy -- make markets in those commodities. Analysts say the gradual unfolding of Enron's financial woes this fall has given its trading partners time to unwind deals and limit their exposure to Enron.   Yet even one of Enron's most stubborn supporters was forced to concede yesterday that his confidence had been shattered by the company's problems, including the rapid depletion of its cash reserves, restatements that erased $600 million in earnings and the surprise disclosure of the $690 million debt.   That fan, Goldman, Sachs & Company's energy analyst, David Fleischer, downgraded the shares to neutral. Until yesterday, Goldman had kept the stock on its recommended list.        Cover Story  CONFUSED ABOUT EARNINGS? You're not alone. Here's what companies should do--and what investors need to know  By Nanette Byrnes and David Henry   With Mike McNamee in Washington    11/26/2001  BusinessWeek  76  (Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)    In an age when giant earnings write-offs have become commonplace, it's hard to shock Wall Street. But on Nov. 8, Enron Corp. managed to do it. After years of high-octane growth that had seen earnings surge by up to 24% a year, the Houston-based energy company acknowledged that results for the past three years were actually overstated by more than a half-billion dollars. It was confirmation of investors' worst fears. Three weeks earlier, Enron had announced a big drop in shareholders' equity, sparking fears that its hideously complex financial statements were distorting its true performance. Management pointed to a number of factors, including a dubious decision to exclude the results of three partnerships from its financial statements and a billion-dollar error several years earlier that had inflated the company's net worth.   Enron may be an extreme example of a company whose performance fell far short of the glowing picture painted by management in its earnings releases, but it is hardly alone. This year, Corporate America is expected to charge off a record $125 billion, much of it for assets, investments, and inventory that aren't worth as much as management thought (chart, page 79). Even if companies don't go back and restate earnings, as Enron is doing, those charges cast doubt on the record-breaking earnings growth of the late '90s.  Not since the 1930s has the quality of corporate earnings been such an issue--and so difficult for investors to determine. There's more at stake than the fortunes of those who bought shares based on misleading numbers. If even the most sophisticated financial minds can't figure out what a company actually earns, that has implications far beyond Enron. U.S. financial markets have a reputation for integrity that took decades to build. It has made the U.S. the gold standard for financial reporting and the preeminent place to invest. It has also ensured ready access to capital for U.S. corporations. That a company such as Enron, a member of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and one of the largest companies on the New York Stock Exchange, could fall so far so fast shows how badly that gold standard has been tarnished. ``The profession of auditing and accounting is, in fact, in crisis,'' says Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve and now one of the leaders of the International Accounting Standards Board.   Sometimes, as in the case of Enron, fuzzy numbers result from questionable decisions in figuring net earnings. More often, though, the earnings chaos results from a disturbing trend among companies to calculate profits in their own idiosyncratic ways--and an increasing willingness among investors and analysts to accept those nonstandard tallies, which appear under a variety of names, from ``pro forma'' to ``core.'' (Enron offers its own such version. Before investors untangled the importance of Enron's first announcement, its stock rose briefly because it told investors that its ``recurring net income'' had met expectations.) The resulting murk makes it difficult to answer the most basic question in investing: What did my company earn?   Why calculate a second set of earnings in the first place? Because the numbers reached by applying generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are woefully inadequate when it comes to giving investors a good sense of a company's prospects. Many institutional investors, most Wall Street analysts, and even many accountants say GAAP is irrelevant. ``I don't know anyone who uses GAAP net income anymore for anything,'' says Lehman Brothers Inc. accounting expert Robert Willens. The problem is that GAAP includes a lot of noncash charges and one-time expenses. While investors need to be aware of those charges, they also need a number that pertains solely to the performance of ongoing operations.   That's what operating earnings are supposed to do. But because they're calculated in an ad hoc manner, with each company free to use its own rules, comparisons between companies have become meaningless. ``No investor--certainly not any ordinary investor--can read these in a way that's useful,'' says Harvey L. Pitt, chairman of the Securities & Exchange Commission. The SEC is examining whether new rules are needed to clarify financial reports and perhaps restrict use of pro formas.   What's badly needed is a set of rules for calculating operating earnings and a requirement to make clear how they relate to net income. In the end, investors need two numbers--a standardized operating number and an audited net-income number--and a clear explanation of how to get from one to the other. ``OUT OF HAND.'' A widespread consensus is building to do just that. In early November, S&P proposed a set of rules for companies to follow when tallying operating earnings. Only the week before, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the rulemakers for GAAP, had announced that they, too, would be taking up this issue. Volcker says the International Accounting Standards Board is also seeking a uniform definition of operating earnings.   ``Over the past two or three years, the use of creative earnings measures has grown and grown and grown to the point where it has really gotten out of hand,'' says David M. Blitzer, S&P's chief investment strategist. ``Earnings are one of the key measures that anybody looks at when they're trying to evaluate a company. If people want to use an operating-earnings measure, we better all know what we're looking at.''   Without those standards in place, the gap between earnings according to generally accepted accounting principles and earnings according to Wall Street is only going to grow wider and more confusing. Look at the variance in earnings per share calculated for the S&P 500 for the third quarter: It's $10.78 according to Wall Street analysts as tallied by Thomson Financial/First Call, $9.17 according to S&P, and $6.37 according to numbers reported to the SEC under GAAP. (S&P, like BusinessWeek, is owned by The McGraw-Hill Companies.)   The lack of a standard measure can be costly to those who choose wrong. Use First Call's earnings for the past four quarters and you get a relatively modest price-earnings ratio of 23 for the S&P 500. But run the numbers using GAAP earnings, and suddenly the market has a far steeper p-e of 38.   How did we get into this mess? Investors and analysts have been calculating operating earnings for years, and for years, reasonable people could more or less agree on how to do it. Then came the dot-com bubble, along with increased pressure from Wall Street for companies to meet their quarterly earnings forecasts. Suddenly, companies that hadn't turned a profit by any conventional measure started offering ever more inventive earnings variants. These customized pro forma calculations excluded a grab bag of expenses and allowed upstart companies to show a profit. ``TOWER OF BABEL.'' Pro forma formulas vary wildly from company to company and even from quarter to quarter within the same company, casting doubt on their validity. And these days, the gulf between net earnings and pro forma earnings is wider than ever. S&P's tallies fall between the two: S&P's numbers are more systematic than pro forma, but they aren't followed widely enough to be a standard. ``Investors are facing a Tower of Babel,'' says Robert K. Elliott, former chief of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and a retired KPMG partner. ``It's not standardized, and the numbers are not audited.''   That makes it tough to evaluate a company's performance. In the quarter ended on Sept. 30, Nortel Networks Corp. offered shareholders at least three earnings numbers to choose from. By conservative GAAP accounting, the telecommunications giant lost $1.08 a share. The company also provided two possible pro forma options: a 68 cents loss that excluded ``special charges,'' including some acquisition costs and restructuring charges, and a still better 27 cents loss that further excluded $1.9 billion of ``incremental charges,'' such as writing down inventories and increasing provisions for receivables. Wall Street chose the rosiest one.   Confusing? You bet. Companies defend their pro forma calculations by pointing out that they're merely filling a void: Investors are clamoring for a measure that gives them better insight into their company's future. The goal is to get to the core of the business and try to measure the outlook for those operations. ``There are good reasons why there is an emphasis on operating earnings,'' says Volcker. ``It is an effort to provide some continuity and some reflection of the underlying progress of the company.'' Besides, as companies like to point out, they still have to report GAAP earnings, and investors are free to ignore everything else.   There's no starker lesson in the shortcomings of GAAP than the $50 billion asset write-downs by JDS Uniphase Corp., the biggest charge of the year. Near the height of the telecom bull market in July, 2000, the San Jose (Calif.) maker of fiber optics topped off a buying spree by acquiring competitor SDL Inc. for $41 billion in stock. When the deal closed in February, its assets ballooned from $25 billion to $65 billion. But by then, shares of JDS and other fiber-optics makers were collapsing. To bring its acquisitions into line with their new value, the company took charges of $50 billion. Despite the fact that the bulk of its losses stemmed from stock transactions and involved no cash paid, GAAP required that the charges be taken out of net income. So according to GAAP, JDS lost $56 billion in the fiscal year ending in June--a staggering figure for a company whose revenues over the past five years added up to only $5 billion.   Analysts and the company argue that besides not involving cash, the charge-off was all about the past, a right-sizing of values that had gotten out of hand. To analyze the company's prospects, they excluded the $50 billion charge. ``The accounting is not designed to make things look better but to describe what happened,'' says JDS Uniphase Chief Financial Officer Anthony R. Muller, ``and we'll live with the consequences, whatever they are.'' Analysts make a similar defense. ``My goal is to figure out what the business is going to produce so that we can value the company,'' says Lehman Brothers analyst Arnab Chanda. GLACIAL PACE. Are JDS's pro forma numbers realistic--a fair gauge of JDS's ongoing operations? Right now, it's hard for investors to judge. And that's the kind of ambiguity S&P and others would like to eliminate. In November, S&P circulated a memo on how to standardize operating earnings. Under the proposal, operating earnings would include the costs of purchases, research and development, restructuring costs (including severance), write-downs from ongoing operations, and the cost to the company of stock options. It would exclude merger-and-acquisition expenses, impairment of goodwill, litigation settlements, and the gain or loss on the sale of an asset.   When S&P applied roughly that formula to JDS Uniphase, it split the difference between Wall Street and GAAP. Because of differences in what each group included in their earnings calculations, the results were chaotic. Using GAAP, the company lost $9.39 a share. S&P figures it lost $3.19, while the company put the loss at 36 cents. Meanwhile, Wall Street says it made 2 cents.   The S&P standard may make sense, but it raises the question: Where is the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the group in charge of GAAP? Chairman Edmund L. Jenkins says FASB will be addressing the problems. Still, investors shouldn't expect any improvement soon. The pace of change at FASB tends to be glacial. It typically takes four years to complete a new standard. In 1996, for example, the board realized that standards on restructuring charges had some big loopholes and it resolved to put the issue on its agenda. In June, 2000, the board finally issued a draft of a new standard, asked for comments, and held a public hearing. In October, 2001, the board said it still wasn't ready to put a fix in place. Now, the recession has set off another wave of restructuring charges, and the FASB still doesn't have new rules.   The slow pace means the standard-setters sometimes fail to react to sudden changes in the market. The most recent failure followed the terrorist attacks on September 11. An FASB task force, unable to come up with a set of rules for separating September 11 costs from general expenses, instead told companies that the disaster could not be treated as an extraordinary item. So GAAP earnings include costs stemming from the disaster as part of a company's general performance. Many companies have nevertheless broken those costs out in their unaudited press releases.   Many more are likely to do so in the fourth quarter. Indeed, 2001 is shaping up to be one for the record books. A poor economy and the devastating aftereffects of September 11 have resulted in a slew of unusual charges that are unlikely to recur and that no one could have foreseen. But there's a growing concern that the earnings fog is providing managers with cover to hide missteps of the past within that vast category of supposedly one-time charges. The temptation will be to take as big a charge as possible now, while investors are braced for bad news. Not only can managers sweep away yesterday's errors, but tomorrow's earnings will look even better.   The basic question comes down to what constitutes a special expense--a charge so unusual that to include it in the earnings calculation would be to distort the truth about a company's performance. Usually, big charges fall into a few categories, including charges for laying off workers and restructuring a company, charges for assets that have lost value since they were purchased, charges for investments that have lost value, and charges for inventory that has become obsolete. In a recent study, Harvard Business School professor Mark T. Bradshaw found that companies are increasingly calling these charges unusual. That gives them a rationale for excluding them from their pro forma calculations.   Lots of critics disagree, saying such charges are often an inevitable part of the business cycle and should be reflected in a company's earnings history. They certainly should not be ignored by investors. ``Charges are real shareholder wealth that's been lost,'' argues David W. Tice, manager of the Prudent Bear Fund, a mutual fund with a pessimistic bent that's up 17% so far this year. ``It's money they spent on something no longer worth what it was, a correction of past earnings, or a reserve for costs moving forward. Whatever the reason, it's a real cost to the company, and that hurts shareholders.'' Without standards, excessive write-offs from operating earnings can obscure actual performance. Without any rules, companies calculate operating earnings inconsistently in order to put their companies in the best possible light. Dell Computer Corp. is a good example of this ``heads I win, tails you lose'' school of accounting. For years, Dell benefited from gains in its venture-capital investments and was happy to include those gains in its reported earnings, where they appeared as a separate line on the income statement. But this year, when those gains turned to losses, the computer maker issued pro forma numbers that excluded that $260 million drag. Dell spokesman Michael Maher says the company's press releases and SEC filings break out investment income and give GAAP numbers as well as pro forma. ``In our view, the numbers are reported clearly,'' says Maher. ``It's all out there for the consuming public.'' PAST PUFFERY. Many experts believe special charges are a sign that past performance was exaggerated. What should investors make of a company such as Gateway Inc.? Two restructuring charges in the first and third quarters, minus a small extraordinary gain, totaled $1.12 billion, or about $100 million more than the company made in 1998, 1999, and 2000 combined. Which is the truer picture of its performance and potential? The write-offs or the earnings? Write-offs for customer financing are another example. When Nortel increased its reserves for credit extended to customers by $767 million in September, it effectively admitted it had booked sales in the past to companies that couldn't pay--in effect overstating its performance in those earlier periods. In addition, Nortel says booking sales and accounting for credit are unrelated issues. Tech companies blame the sharp downturn in their industry for the big write-offs. And these aren't isolated examples. Peter L. Bernstein, publisher of newsletter Economics & Portfolio Strategy, found that from 1989 to 1993, 20% of earnings vanished into write-offs.   Big charge-offs can also distort future performance. Critics contend that excess reserves are often used as a sort of ``cookie jar'' from which earnings can be taken in future quarters to meet Wall Street's expectations. Or charges taken this year, for example, which is apt to be a lousy one for most companies anyway, might include costs that would otherwise have been taken in future periods. Prepaying those costs gives a big boost to later earnings. Rules for figuring operating earnings would help, but this is an area that will always involve a certain amount of judgment--and therefore invite a certain amount of abuse. ``People are going to write off everything they can in the next two quarters because they're having a bad year anyway,'' says Robert G. Atkins, a Mercer Management consultant.   Part of the lure of big special charges is that investors tend to shrug them off, believing that with the bad news out in the open, the company is poised for a brighter future. Since Gateway detailed its third-quarter charge of $571 million on Oct. 18, Wall Street has bid the stock up 48%, compared with a 6% runup for the S&P 500.   Often, though, investors should take exactly the opposite message. If, for example, part of a restructuring involves slashing employee training, information-technology spending, or research and development, the cuts could depress future performance, says Baruch Lev, a professor of accounting at the Stern School of Business at New York University. ``Are these really one-time events?'' he asks. ``Or is this the beginning of an avalanche?'' Indeed, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. strategist Steve Galbraith has found that in the year following a big charge-off to earnings companies have underperformed the stock market by 20 percentage points. ``LA LA LAND.'' Investors are apt to be faced with more huge write-offs next year, even if the economy doesn't continue to worsen. Why? The transition to a new GAAP rule that changes the way companies account for goodwill--a balance-sheet asset that reflects the amount paid for an acquisition over the net value of the tangible assets. Under the new rule, companies will have to assess their properties periodically and decrease their worth on the balance sheet if their value falls. An informal survey by Financial Executives International of its member controllers and financial officers found that at least a third expect to take more charges.   But figuring out the proper value of those assets is no easy task. Unless there is a comparable company or factory with an established market price, valuing them involves a lot of guesswork for which there are no firm rules. ``What this is really coming down to is corporations and their auditors coming up with their own tests for impairment,'' says the Stern School's Professor Paul R. Brown. ``It's La La Land.''   While the tidal wave of special charges is providing cover for earnings games, it could also be an impetus for change--especially in the wake of the dot-com fiasco. Indeed, there are some signs of a backlash. The real estate investment trust industry was a pioneer of engineered earnings, with its ``funds from operations,'' or FFO. But now some REITs have begun to revert to plain old GAAP earnings. Hamid R. Moghadam, CEO of San Francisco-based AMB Property Corp., shifted back to GAAP in 1999. ``The reason I don't like FFO is very simple,'' says Moghadam. ``One company's numbers look better than another one's even if they had identical fundamental results.''   There are other steps FASB could take to improve financial reporting and restore GAAP's status. Trevor S. Harris, an accounting expert at Morgan Stanley, says it could force companies to make clear distinctions between income from operations and income from financial transactions. Lehman's Willens says companies should provide more information on cash expenses and how they bear on earnings. An easy step would be to require companies to file their press releases with the SEC.   At the least, says Lev, companies must clearly explain how their pro forma numbers relate to the GAAP numbers. Otherwise, he says, investors ``see numbers floating there, and where did they come from?'' In today's environment of unregulated pro forma calculations and supersize write-offs, no question is more important to investors.    High-Gloss Glossary  Companies are using a variety of accounting practices to put the best spin on  their results. Here's what those terms mean:  DEFINING EARNINGS:  NET INCOME  The bottom line, according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  Sometimes called ``reported earnings,'' these are the numbers the Securities &  Exchange Commission accepts in its filings.  OPERATING EARNINGS  An adjustment of net income that excludes certain costs deemed to be unrelated  to the ongoing business. Although it sounds deceptively like a GAAP figure  called ``operating income'' (revenue minus the costs of doing business), it is  not an audited figure.  CORE EARNINGS  Another term for operating earnings. Neither core nor operating earnings are  calculated according to set rules. They can include or exclude anything the  preparer wishes.  PRO FORMA EARNINGS  The 1990s term for operating earnings. Popularized by dot-coms, it sometimes  excludes such basic costs as marketing and interest.  EBITDA  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. The  granddaddy of pro forma, it was initially highlighted by industries that  carried high debt loads, such as cable TV, but has since come to be widely  quoted.  ADJUSTED EARNINGS  A new term for pro forma.  DEFINING COSTS:  SPECIAL CHARGES  A general term for anything a company wants to highlight as unusual and  therefore to be excluded from future earnings projections.  ASSET IMPAIRMENTS  Charges taken to bring something a company paid a high price for down to its  current market value. Many companies are now taking these charges on internal  venture-capital funds that bought Internet and other high-tech stocks at  inflated prices.  GOODWILL IMPAIRMENTS  The same idea as asset impairments except they're used to write down the  premium a company paid over the fair market value of the net tangible assets  acquired. These charges will explode in the first quarter of 2002 because of a  change in mergers-and-acquisitions accounting that eliminates goodwill  amortization and requires holdings to be carried at no more than fair values.  RESTRUCTURING RESERVES  An accrued expense (not usually cash) to cover future costs of closing down a  portion of a business, a plant, or of firings. These are projected costs and  if overstated can later become a boost to earnings as they are reversed.  WRITE-DOWN  Lowering the value of an asset, such as a plant or stock investment. It is  often excused as a bookkeeping exercise, but there may have been a real cost  long ago that now proves ill spent, or there may have been associated cash  costs, such as investment-banking fees.

Editorials  END THE NUMBERS GAME    11/26/2001  BusinessWeek  130  (Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)    What did the company earn? That's the most basic question an investor can ever ask. The equity culture that has generated so much growth over the years depends on a clear answer, but getting one has become impossible. Enron Corp. just announced that its earnings for the past three years were overstated by half a billion dollars. How did one of the biggest companies on the New York Stock Exchange manage to inflate its earnings by 20% without auditors, analysts, ratings agencies, and the business press (BusinessWeek included) discovering it? In part, blame the breakdown of standardized accounting rules and the anarchy that runs rampant in the financial statements of Corporate America. The U.S. needs a new set of accounting rules that gives a clear picture of financial performance. Without integrity in financial reporting, the U.S. cannot hope to remain the preeminent place to invest in the global marketplace (page 76).   The dot-com bubble was the first indication that there was something seriously wrong with accounting standards. Companies without much of a business model customized their quarterly statements to exclude a grab bag of expenses in order to put a positive financial spin on their operations. Wall Street conspired in this and encouraged big companies to join in. Soon, the method of calculating earnings began to vary from company to company and even from quarter to quarter within a company. It is now chaos.  A stricter adherence to accounting rules won't solve the entire problem. GAAP, the generally accepted accounting principles, allow all kinds of one-time expenses and noncash charges. This obscures the performance of ongoing operations. No one can fathom what are true operating earnings because there are no guidelines as to what constitutes an extraordinary expense. The result is total confusion. Take earnings per share for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index for the second quarter. Under Thomson Financial/First Call standards, it is $11.82. But it's $9.02 according to S&P and $4.83 under GAAP. How can investors make intelligent decisions?   The Financial Accounting Standards Board clearly is failing to do its job. It has promised to write a set of rules that calculates operating earnings and relates them to net earnings, but it hasn't delivered. The rating agency Standard & Poor's (owned by The McGraw-Hill Companies, as is BusinessWeek) is doing a better job. It recently drew up a definition of ``operating earnings'' that includes restructuring costs (including severance), writedowns from ongoing operations, and the cost of stock options. It excludes merger and acquisition expenses, litigation settlements, impairment of goodwill, and gains or losses on asset sales. This is a beginning that FASB should build on. The accounting anarchy has to end.      COMPANIES & FINANCE INTERNATIONAL - Enron still optimistic of averting financial meltdown.  By ANDREW HILL and SHEILA MCNULTY.    11/26/2001  Financial Times  (c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved    Enron said yesterday it was still expecting outside investors to inject $500m to $1bn into the group, as talks continued to avoid a financial meltdown at the energy trading group.   Dynegy, whose rescue bid for its Houston rival is crucial to Enron's survival, spent last week's Thanksgiving holiday and the weekend reviewing Enron's operations and finances.  Dynegy said it remained \"optimistic for the potential of the merger to be completed, and in the time-frame we originally announced - six to nine months\".   Enron's fate depends on a delicate, unofficial pact between its lenders, Dynegy, and credit ratings agencies, which have resisted downgrading the group's debt while the deal is pending.   If the pact stays in place, at least $500m is likely to be invested in Enron by JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup, Enron's key lenders and advisers. A further $500m is being sought from private equity firms.   But if Dynegy pulls out of the deal, the cash infusion could be put in jeopardy and the ratings agencies could downgrade the debt to junk, triggering debt repayments across a network of partnerships and off-balance-sheet vehicles linked to Enron.   Enron confirmed yesterday that it was still seeking additional liquidity from new equity investors, but would not discuss their identities.   Enron's crisis of confidence became more acute last week when the shares fell from $9 to $4.74 following a regulatory filing that revealed the extent of the group's debt burden.   Completion of a $1bn secured credit line from JPM Chase and Citigroup, and the postponement of a $690m notes repayment due tomorrow were not sufficient to prop up the share price. The bonds also fell to levels consistent with a potential bankruptcy filing.   The slide in the share price has encouraged speculation that Dynegy is preparing to renegotiate its all-stock bid, now worth $9.3bn, compared with Enron's market value of $3.5bn.   But people close to Enron say renegotiation of the deal would not in itself have any impact on the energy group's finances. Latest news, www.ft.com/enron.   (c) Copyright Financial Times Ltd.

Schwab Chief's Main Theme: Diversification  By Lynnette Khalfani  Dow Jones Newswires    11/26/2001  The Wall Street Journal  (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)    NEW YORK -- More than two months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, many investors remain edgy. But the stock market, after an initial selloff, has shown remarkable resilience.   Few observers expect stock-market volatility to subside soon. Still, experts say that now, more than ever, is the time for skittish investors to keep their wits about them.  In a recent interview, Charles R. Schwab, chairman and co-chief executive of Charles Schwab & Co., the San Francisco-based online and discount brokerage firm, gave his views on what investors should be doing -- and what mistakes they should avoid.   Here are some excerpts from the interview:   In the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, how much more risk, if any, do you think is in the financial markets? Or do you think it's just that people's perceptions about risk have changed?   I've been investing since 1959, and I have to say that, year after year, the risk hasn't changed. The risk is always there. There's risk in investing in stocks, bonds and even U.S. Treasuries because of interest-rate [fluctuations]. There's risk in real estate, too.   So the question is: How do you handle it? The best way is to diversify. Over a long period of time, people who diversify their investments do pretty darned well. When they don't . . . sometimes it's fatal. If the only stock an investor owned was Enron . . . or Cisco at 70, that was pretty fatal.   What do you say to people who say they're too scared to invest right now? That because of the threat of terrorism, the anthrax scares, the war in Afghanistan, the recession, and so forth, there's just too much uncertainty in the markets?   I remember back during the Cuban missile crisis, we all feared the worst. We were all building bomb shelters. It was a scary time. This terrorist thing is no different. It's awful -- particularly for our children. But this country is so wealthy, in terms of its resources, intellectual capital and the strength of our government.   There is no more uncertainty today than in times past. For example, we've had many recessions. It's not fun, especially when you begin reading about all these layoffs. In fact, I think the unemployment rate [now at 5.4%] pretty easily might get to 6.5% before it gets better. And it probably won't get better until March or April. Also, the stock market will go up, hopefully before the economy goes up.   There's $2 trillion sitting in money-market accounts. That's a huge resource and buying power that's definitely available for new investments.   What do you think is the biggest mistake investors have made over the past two or so months?   They let their emotions take over. With the fear that people had, they didn't use their rational thinking. They used their emotional thinking. [After Sept. 11], they sold at the low, and fear was the driver.   Just a year and a half ago, the driving emotion was greed. You're not going to avoid this stuff. So the issue is how you manage through these cycles of fear and greed. Even when I'm fearful of something, I say to myself: \"This is still the time to invest.\"   My biggest worry right now is that people will give up and say, \"I just don't want to be in the stock market at all.\" And it's just the time that people should be hanging on and keeping a diversified portfolio.   Some other mistakes: A lot of people hang on to the stock that was the poster child of the last cycle. Or people say, \"I'll get back in [the market] when I see the economy turn around.\" Well, by the time they see that, it's too late. They will have missed the whole ride back up.

Business; Financial Desk  Enron Pursuing a Cash Infusion Energy: Company is seeking as much as $1billion as it tries to shore up its endangered acquisition by Dynegy.  From Bloomberg News    11/26/2001  Los Angeles Times  Home Edition  C-2  Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company    HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. said talks are continuing with potential investors for an infusion of as much as $1 billion as the biggest energy trader tries to avoid a collapse of its planned purchase by Dynegy Inc.   An investment would ease concern that Enron's weakened finances may prompt Dynegy to pull out of or renegotiate the terms of the transaction, which is valued at $23 billion in stock and assumed debt.  Enron is seeking an additional $500 million to $1 billion in cash but wouldn't divulge details. \"We are not going to discuss the particulars of who we are talking to,\" Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said Sunday.   Shares of the Houston company fell by 48% in the last three trading sessions on the New York Stock Exchange. At Friday's closing price of $4.71, the stock sells for less than half the $10.85 that Dynegy is slated to pay in the acquisition. That's a sign investors are skeptical the transaction will go through as planned.   Enron is likely to have approached Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts & Co., Blackstone Group and Carlyle Group for a private equity investment, said industry analyst David Snow of PrivateEquityCentral.Net.   The firms have declined to comment.   In a conference call Nov. 14, Enron Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon said the company is in talks with several private investors and expects to receive $500 million to $1 billion from those sources.   On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on a $690-million note due this week, gaining more time to restructure its finances. Dynegy Chief Executive Chuck Watson said he was \"encouraged\" by the commitment to extend the note payment as well as the closing of a $450-million credit facility. He said Dynegy remained committed to the purchase.   Enron already received $1.5 billion in cash Nov. 13 from ChevronTexaco Inc. as part of the Dynegy buyout agreement. In return, Dynegy received preferred stock and other rights in an Enron unit that owns the Northern Natural Gas Co. pipeline. Under the deal's terms, if Dynegy and Enron fail to merge, Dynegy can acquire the pipeline company.   But Barron's reported over the weekend that Dynegy's right to the pipeline might be challenged by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Salomon Smith Barney Inc., which accepted the asset as collateral for $1billion in loans to Enron.   Dynegy spokesman John Sousa declined to comment on Enron's attempts to secure financing or whether more cash for Enron is a condition of keeping the merger alive.   Enron's dealings with affiliated partnerships have led to a federal investigation of the company, which restated its earnings and saw its credit ratings cut.   The company said in a Securities and Exchange filing a week ago that it has less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines left.    Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.      Dynegy Optimistic That Enron Merger Will Succeed - FT    11/26/2001  Dow Jones International News  (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)    LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) remains optimistic, after further review of Enron Corp.'s (ENE) finances last week, that it will be able to buy the company, the Financial Times reported Monday.   Dynegy said that it, \"remained optimistic for the potential of the merger to be completed, and in the time frame we originally announced - six to nine months,\" the FT reported.  Critical investment in Enron by J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup will proceed only if an unofficial pact between Enron, Dynegy, and Enron's lenders and credit rating agencies remains intact, the report said. Investment from these two is likely to total between $500 million and $1 billion, while Enron continues to look for a further $500 million from private equity firms.   The deal suffered a setback last week, when a regulatory filing revealed a greater debt burden than some investors had realized. Enron's share price fell following the report, to $4.74 from $9.00.   A $1 billion secured credit line from J.P. Morgan Chase and an extension of a $690 million repayment due Tuesday weren't enough to keep the share price from falling. This led to speculation that Dynegy was considering renegotiating its all-stock bid, now at $9.3 billion, compared with Enron's market value of $3.5 billion, said the report.   Renegotiating the deal wouldn't have any impact on Enron's finances, unnamed sources told the FT.   But if Dynegy pulled out of the deal altogether, there might be no cash infusion from J.P. Morgan chase and Citigroup. Credit ratings agencies could then downgrade Enron's debt to junk, forcing partners to repay debts, the report said.   -By Sarah Spikes, Dow Jones Newswires; +44-(0)20-7842-9345; sarah.spikes@dowjones.com    Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.      Dynegy Purchase Prompts Antitrust Concerns, L.A. Times Says  2001-11-26 07:36 (New York)           Washington, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- California Attorney  General Bill Lockyer is examining Dynegy Inc.'s proposed  acquisition of rival energy seller Enron Corp. for possible  antitrust violations, the Los Angeles Times reported.         The California Independent System Operator, which manages the  state's electric grid, has asked federal regulators to ban Dynegy  and other major power sellers, including Mirant, and AES Corp.'s  Williams Cos., from selling electricity at market prices in the  state, the Times said.         Throughout the state's power crisis, Governor Gray Davis and  other officials accused Dynegy, Enron and other power companies of  withholding electricity and manipulating the cost of wholesale  power to gouge consumers, the Times said.         Enron is negotiating with bankers to restructure $9.15  billion in debt.         ``I would hope that the people who look at the antitrust  implications would consider this one carefully,'' California State  Senator Steve Peace, a Democrat, told the Times. ``If anything,  Dynegy would be in an even stronger position to be able to  manipulate markets than it was before.''        Financial Post: News  Enron hopes for infusion of capital: Seeks US$500M as talks of Dynegy merger continue  Andrew Hill and Sheila McNulty  Financial Times    11/26/2001  National Post  National  FP3  (c) National Post 2001. All Rights Reserved.    Enron Corp. said yesterday it was still expecting outside investors to inject US$500-million to US$1-billion into the group, as talks continued to avoid a financial meltdown at the energy trading group.   Dynegy Inc., whose rescue bid for its Houston-based rival is crucial to Enron's survival, spent last week's U.S. Thanksgiving holiday and the weekend reviewing Enron's operations and finances.  Dynegy said it remained \"optimistic for the potential of the merger to be completed, and in the time-frame we originally announced -- six to nine months.\"   Enron's fate depends on a delicate, unofficial pact between its lenders, Dynegy, and credit ratings agencies, which have resisted downgrading the group's debt while the deal is pending.   If the pact stays in place, at least US$500-million is likely to be invested in Enron by JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup, Enron's key lenders and advisers. A further US$500-million is being sought from private equity firms.   But if Dynegy pulls out of the deal, the cash infusion could be put in jeopardy and the ratings agencies could downgrade the debt to junk, triggering debt repayments across a network of partnerships and off-balance-sheet vehicles linked to Enron.   Enron confirmed yesterday it was still seeking additional liquidity from new equity investors, but would not discuss their identities.   Enron's crisis of confidence became more acute last week when the shares fell to US$4.74 from US$9 after a regulator filing that revealed the extent of the group's debt burden.   Completion of a US$1-billion secured credit line from JPM Chase and Citigroup, and the postponement of a US$690-million notes repayment due tomorrow, were not sufficient to prop up the share price. The bonds also fell to levels consistent with a potential bankruptcy filing.   The slide in the share price has encouraged speculation Dynegy is preparing to renegotiate its all-stock bid, now worth US$9.3-billion, compared with Enron's market value of US$3.5-billion.   But people close to Enron say renegotiation of the deal would not in itself have any impact on the energy group's finances.    Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.          Deal still on as Enron shares drop 6%   Houston Chronicle  By NELSON ANTOSH  Staff  11/24/01    Shares of Enron dropped another 6 percent Friday, as the investment community fretted that the acquisition price for the company by Dynegy may be reduced, or the deal might not go through at all.   The two sides didn't offer anything new for worried investors.   Dynegy stuck to its Wednesday statement that it is working to accelerate regulatory approvals in order to complete the deal as previously announced.   Dynegy is continuing to take a close look at Enron as part of the due diligence process, which will involve careful study of Enron 's books, Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said on Friday.   On Wednesday, Dynegy Chief Executive Chuck Watson said he was encouraged that Enron had closed a $450 million credit security and received an extension on a $690 million IOU.   Dynegy remains optimistic that the deal can be done, said a source close to the company.   Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said she was unaware of any meetings planned between top executives of the two companies this weekend, which could signal alterations to the deal.   Enron 's stock, which was the most active on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, dropped 30 cents to close at $4.71 per share.   This made it the worst performing stock in the Standard & Poor's 500 index for the week, with a loss of 48 percent for the holiday-shortened period.   It was a bad week for a stock that has come down from a 52-week high of $84.87 on Dec. 28 last year. For the year to date, Enron 's price is off 94 percent.   More than 40 million shares traded hands Friday. On Wednesday, 116 million shares were traded.   Analyst Ron Barone of UBS Warburg said the odds of a reduced exchange ratio in the deal were rising.   As announced Nov. 9, Dynegy would exchange 0.2685 of its shares for each share of Enron . According to Barone, 0.15 might be more appropriate.   Traders also speculated that Enron might need to issue more stock to stabilize its finances, which would dilute the shares currently outstanding.   Dynegy's stock gained 64 cents to close Friday at $40.40 per share, on trading of 2.1 million shares. For the year to date, Dynegy's price is off 28 percent.      Analysis: Travails of the Enron Corporation    11/24/2001  NPR: Weekend Edition - Saturday  Copyright 2001 National Public Radio, Inc. All Rights Reserved.    SCOTT SIMON, host: This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Scott Simon. Coming up, recognizing New Yorkers by their lunch orders.   But first, trading energy. This week, stock in the Enron Corporation fell like a 14-pound turkey carcass thrown from a third-story kitchen window--kathunk. Continues a trend over the past few months. Enron shares have plunged more than 90 percent since the departure of the company's chief executive and the reworking of some balance sheets resulting in a restatement of income, about $580 million less than previously reported. Joe Nocera is the executive editor of Fortune magazine and a frequent contributor to this program.  Joe, thank you for being with us.   JOE NOCERA (Executive Editor, Fortune Magazine): Thanks for having me, Scott.   SIMON: Now Enron, we ought to explain, it's more than pipelines and gas. Yes?   NOCERA: It's a lot more--or a lot less, depending on how you look at it.   SIMON: A lot less perhaps, yes, now.   NOCERA: They've actually shed most of their hard assets when they became a trading company, trading energy futures, weather futures, broad band futures, a very complicated New Age, modern type company. And for a long time, everybody really believed in what Enron was. They were the kind of the dot-com of the energy world and were thought to do no wrong. And then, Scott, people stopped believing; people stopped having faith and, in particular, people stopped believing anything management said. This is a case study in what happens when management loses credibility. These guys kept saying, `All the problems are behind us,' and every time they said it, a week later, some new problem would crop up. And people started examining their balance sheet and finding all this squirrelly stuff in it. And now basically, if Enron doesn't do this deal that it's negotiated to do with Dynegy, they're going to go bankrupt. It's really an incredible story.   SIMON: Explain to us, if you could, what you refer to--and I guess it's a technical term among economists--`squirrelly stuff.'   NOCERA: Yeah, the squirrelly stuff.   SIMON: Yeah.   NOCERA: Well, the worst that happened was that they had--it turned out that they had all these side partnerships that included Enron officials that were doing billion-dollar trades with Enron, and nobody quite knows why they were doing this. Some people believe it was to enrich the officers in question, but other people believe that they were doing this to help smooth out their earnings. In other words, it was a form of hyping the stocks to keep the earnings going up, and they would take their losses--they'd bundle their losses and they'd throw them in these partnerships so they wouldn't be on the balance sheet.   And when this stuff started to emerge in the newspapers, that's when the wheels really started to fall off, and people were saying, `If this is going on, what'--I mean, this his terrible in and of itself--`but what else could there be?' And it turns out there've been other things as well.   SIMON: Well, you know, I think I understand why now Enron wants the deal with Dynegy to go through, but what does Dynegy see in this?   NOCERA: Well, Enron still does somewhere 25 and 33 percent of all the natural gas and energy futures trade in the United States. It's a huge marketplace, and Dynegy is a much smaller and more conservative player and, you know, by buying Enron, suddenly they became a much, much bigger player. Also, Dynegy actually has hard physical assets and, unlike Enron, they wouldn't just be a middleman on these trades, they would actually be delivering the natural gas. There is something in it for Dynegy. They're buying a very big company at for what now looks like $5 a share. It's really incredible.   SIMON: And let me ask about this, finally; some Enron employees--a good number of Enron employees are suing the company, contending, credibly, that they've been essentially defrauded out of pension money.   NOCERA: Right. Their big gripe is that when the thing started to tank, when the stock started to go down, they were unable to move their--get out of Enron stock and their pension fund--that Enron actually throws the stock in their fund, so they couldn't move out into a different investment vehicle. Now they're saying that, you know, they've been defrauded because the stock was fraudulently hyped. And you know what, Scott? When all is said and done, I think they've got a case. I think they're going to be able to, in fact, show that much of what Enron did, the reason they did the things they did was to hype the stock. And this is a classic case of what happens when you put the stock in front of the company instead of the company in front of the stock.   SIMON: I hate to ask a question like this with just five seconds left, but could there be a criminal investigation?   NOCERA: Oh, I think there will be. The SEC is already circling around.   SIMON: OK, Joe, thanks very much.   NOCERA: Thank you, Scott.   SIMON: Joe Nocera, executive editor of Fortune magazine, and speaking with us from the studios of member station WFCR, Amherst.        Dynegy's Right to Enron Pipeline May Be Disputed, Barron's Says  2001-11-24 13:52 (New York)           Houston, Nov. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Dynegy Inc. may have a hard  time claiming one of Enron Corp.'s pipelines if their merger  agreement collapses, because the asset has been pledged as  collateral for $1 billion in bank loans, Barron's reported.         Dynegy has said its initial investment of $1.5 billion in  Enron, using cash from ChevronTexaco Corp., gave Dynegy the right  to acquire Northern Natural Gas Co. if the deal falls through.         Enron, though, has pledged the assets of its Transwestern and  Northern Natural Gas pipelines to get $1 billion in loans from  J.P. Morgan Chase and Salomon Smith Barney Inc. Dynegy's claim to  the pipeline may be challenged by Enron's lenders if Enron is  forced into bankruptcy, Barron's said.         Dynegy may also be concerned about Enron affecting its credit  rating, Barron's said. Dynegy, which has a market value of more  than $10 billion and assets worth only $2.5 billion, is listed two  notches above junk status and is on watch for a possible  downgrade, the weekly newspaper said.         Barron's said renegotiating the purchase in response to a  recent decline in Enron's shares might not make sense because the  company's debt accounts for most of the deal's value, now around  $23 billion.      Money and Business/Financial Desk; Section 3  INVESTING: DIARY  Accounting Peer Review Gets More Scrutiny  Compiled by Jeff Sommer    11/25/2001  The New York Times  Page 8, Column 1  c. 2001 New York Times Company    The accounting industry's watchdog group is examining the industry's ''peer review'' process in light of enormous accounting problems at the Enron Corporation.   The group, called the Public Oversight Board, will meet next week to consider whether reviews of audits being conducted by accounting firms adequately safeguard the public interest, according to its chairman, Charles Bowsher. The session comes after revelations by Enron that it had overstated earnings by nearly $600 million over four years and that it had inflated shareholder equity by $1.2 billion because of ''an accounting error.''  Arthur Andersen has been Enron's outside auditor for more than a decade, and its work has been submitted periodically to Deloitte & Touche for ''peer reviewing.'' One such review is being conducted now.   Representative John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, said in a letter to Mr. Bowsher that no Big Five accounting firm had ever issued a negative report after a peer review. Mr. Bowsher told Bloomberg News that the Oversight Board would ask: ''How can you have peer reviews and still have these kinds of failures?''    Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.      Editorial Desk; Section 4  Reckonings  An Alternate Reality  By PAUL KRUGMAN    11/25/2001  The New York Times  Page 11, Column 1  c. 2001 New York Times Company    Most Americans get their news from TV. And what they see is heartwarming -- a picture of a nation behaving well in a time of crisis. Indeed, the vast majority of Americans have been both resolute and generous.   But that's not the whole story, and the images TV doesn't show are anything but heartwarming. A full picture would show politicians and businessmen behaving badly, with this bad behavior made possible -- and made worse -- by the fact that these days selfishness comes tightly wrapped in the flag. If you pay attention to the whole picture, you start to feel that you are living in a different reality from the one on TV.  The alternate reality isn't deeply hidden. It's available to anyone with a modem, and some of it makes it into quality newspapers. Often you can find the best reporting on what's really going on in the business section, because business reporters and commentators are not expected to view the world through rose-colored glasses.   From an economist's point of view, the most revealing indicator of what's really happening is the post-Sept. 11 fondness of politicians for ''lump-sum transfers.'' That's economese for payments that aren't contingent on the recipient's actions, and which therefore give no incentive for changed behavior. That's good if the transfer is meant to help someone in need, without reducing his motivation to work. It's bad if the alleged purpose of the transfer is to get the recipient to do something useful, like invest or hire more workers.   So it tells you something when Congress votes $15 billion in aid and loan guarantees for airline companies but not a penny for laid-off airline workers. It tells you even more when the House passes a ''stimulus'' bill that contains almost nothing for the unemployed but includes $25 billion in retroactive corporate tax cuts -- that is, pure lump-sum transfers to corporations, most of them highly profitable.   Most political reporting about the stimulus debate describes it as a conflict of ideologies. But ideology has nothing to do with it. No economic doctrine I'm aware of, right or left, says that an $800 million lump-sum transfer to General Motors will lead to more investment when the company is already sitting on $8 billion in cash.   As Jonathan Chait points out, there used to be some question about the true motives of people like Dick Armey and Tom DeLay. Did they really believe in free markets, or did they just want to take from the poor and give to the rich? Now we know.   Of course, it's not all about lump-sum transfers. Since Sept. 11 there has also been a sustained effort, under cover of the national emergency, to open public lands to oil companies and logging interests. Administration officials claim that it's all for the sake of national security, but when you discover that they also intend to reverse rules excluding snowmobiles from Yellowstone, the truth becomes clear.   So what's the real state of the nation? On TV this looks like World War II. But though our cause is just, for 99.9 percent of Americans this war, waged by a small cadre of highly trained professionals, is a spectator event. And the home front looks not like wartime but like a postwar aftermath, in which the normal instincts of a nation at war -- to rally round the flag and place trust in our leaders -- are all too easily exploited.   Indeed, current events bear an almost eerie resemblance to the period just after World War I. John Ashcroft is re-enacting the Palmer raids, which swept up thousands of immigrants suspected of radicalism; the vast majority turned out to be innocent of any wrongdoing, and some turned out to be U.S. citizens. Executives at Enron seem to have been channeling the spirit of Charles Ponzi. And the push to open public lands to private exploitation sounds like Teapot Dome, which also involved oil drilling on public land. Presumably this time there have been no outright bribes, but the giveaways to corporations are actually much larger.   What this country needs is a return to normalcy. And I don't mean the selective normalcy the Bush administration wants, in which everyone goes shopping but the media continue to report only inspiring stories and war news. It's time to give the American people the whole picture.    Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.      Money and Business/Financial Desk; Section 3  MARKET WATCH  Will New York Be Told, Once Again, to Drop Dead?  By ALEX BERENSON    11/25/2001  The New York Times  Page 1, Column 2  c. 2001 New York Times Company    NEARLY 11 weeks after the worst terrorist attack in history, New York is discovering just how much the rest of the United States cares about the nation's business and financial center.   Not much.  Early hopes that the nation would rally to help the city overcome the devastating economic impact of Sept. 11 appear to have been misplaced. Not only is Gov. George E. Pataki's ill-advised pitch for $54 billion in federal aid all but dead, apparently the city will struggle to get the $20 billion that President Bush promised.   Yes, many of the city's economic problems are self-inflicted. With a municipal work force of 250,000, New York employs one-seventh as many people as the federal government, excluding the armed forces. To support that bureaucracy, the city has the highest taxes of any local government in America. Development is absurdly difficult, even outside Manhattan. Roads and bridges are a mess.   But all of that was true before Sept. 11, and New York somehow made do. In fact, a record number of new jobs were created here in 2000, according to Steven Malanga, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative policy group. ''In the last seven or eight years, the city's economy has rebounded in a way that's very encouraging,'' he said.   The attacks changed all that. By discouraging people from coming to crowded places like Times Square, terrorism strikes at the heart of New York, said Mitchell Moss, director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University. ''New York's economy is built on interaction,'' he said. The industries that have suffered most severely are New York's most important employers: tourism, media, advertising and financial services, which was due for cuts even before the attacks.   Last month, the city lost 79,000 jobs, a record. The slowdown has blown a hole in city and state budgets, which are precariously balanced at the best of times. The Citizens Budget Commission, a nonpartisan fiscal watchdog organization, predicts that the city will face a budget deficit of $4 billion next year.   Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has asked city agencies to cut their budgets by 15 percent. More cuts are coming. Libraries will close earlier. Parks will be dirtier. And city workers, who had been asking for big raises, will have to accept layoffs or pay cuts.   Even so, the city cannot get out of this hole alone. With taxes already too high, it cannot reach much deeper into its citizens' pockets. And there are limits to how much it can cut services. A little federal help would go a long way toward righting the city's budget gap and restoring confidence in New York.   Mr. Moss suggests the federal government take two steps to show its commitment to the city. First, it should help create a hub in Lower Manhattan that would connect transit lines from New Jersey and Long Island with the subway. Second, it should support ''security zones'' where high-profile securities firms and media companies could congregate if they wished.   For now, at least, it appears that Washington will let New York sink or swim on its own. That decision is foolish for both economic and symbolic reasons.   If New York cannot right itself, the securities firms that are among its most important employers are as likely to move jobs to London or Hong Kong as Chicago or Atlanta. And if New York's streets grow dirty and its crime rate soars, other countries may question Washington's promises of aid to those that try to deter terrorism. Will a government that does not bother to aid its largest city in the wake of the worst terror attack in history really do much for Islamabad or Cairo?   ''What do we have a federal government for if it's not to give aid to state and local governments, at the level people live and get most of their government services?'' asks James A. Parrot, an economist at the Fiscal Policy Institute, a labor-backed research organization.   It is worse than unseemly that lawmakers are offering to pass a tax bill that will give billions of dollars to companies like Enron and I.B.M. while refusing to send New York money that that city has already been promised. It is (whisper this word) unpatriotic.    Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.      Style Desk; Section 9  Dot-Com Is Dot-Gone, And the Dream With It  By JOHN SCHWARTZ    11/25/2001  The New York Times  Page 1, Column 2  c. 2001 New York Times Company    MARK LEIBOVICH recalled the day in 1999 when he showed up early for an appointment at a Washington dot-com. Mr. Leibovich, a reporter for The Washington Post, was there to interview the company's executives. ''I got there just in time to see the C.E.O. himself wheeling a foosball table into the lobby'' to give the impression that the high-tech firm possessed the desired quantum of wackiness that its Silicon Valley counterparts are famous for.   That is so over, and so much more over, even, than before. The popular obsession with the dot-com revolution, fading for more than a year, seems to have simply winked out since mid-September, as firemen and warriors have become the new heroes, and e-commerce's whiz kids are consigned to the cultural boneyard.  Not much more than a year ago, boosters of the New Economy and their true believers in the press were claiming to have changed all the rules. Not just in tech-fetish magazines like Wired, but in self-styled cultural arbiters like New York magazine, which declared the 1990's the ''e-Decade.'' In a 1999 cover story, the essayist Michael Wolff -- himself a failed dot-com executive -- announced a brave new world. ''There is, at the elusive center of the e-experience, the fantasy that we might become free of economic laws,'' he wrote. ''All it takes to make otherworldly riches is the will and desire.'' It wasn't enough to make money. They had to make history.   Now they themselves are history. Each day, the old idols seem to fade further into the dim past, barely recollected in a country where the languages of ''revolution'' and ''warfare'' are no longer just business metaphors. This is the next step after the bursting of the dot-com economic bubble -- the bursting of the cultural bubble, the end of the nerd as a crossover hit, of the I.P.O. zillionaire as role model to college students.   The changing of the guard can be seen in little things. Like Henry Blodget, the industry analyst who became famous for predicting early that Amazon.com would reach $400 a share, announcing that he is taking a buyout and leaving Merrill Lynch at the grand old age of 35.   Like the growing wave of books that focus not on the dot-com path to riches but on the wild plunge into the abyss. Having failed to sell their dreams, they are now attempting to sell their failure. A documentary of the rise and fall of a Silicon Alley company was chronicled in ''Startup.Com'' by Sebastian Nokes, released last winter. Books by former dot-com executives are arriving in stores. Two of the first are ''A Very Public Offering: A Rebel's Story of Business Excess, Success, and Reckoning'' by Stephan Paternot, founder of Theglobe.com, and ''Dot.bomb: My Days and Nights at an Internet Goliath,'' by J. David Kuo. Another is coming soon: ''Boo Hoo,'' the chronicle of the spectacular failure of Boo.com, the luxury fashion site that burned through $185 million of its investors' cash and had an online life of just six months, told by its profligate founders.   Did we mention that Mr. Blodget is writing a book?   For the most part, however, the flood of dot-com failure stories is being met with a national yawn. The tell-all books have bounced around the Amazon.com rankings without making inroads into best-seller territory. And why not? Because former idols have feet of clay. In ''A Very Public Offering,'' a book written as amateurishly as the company was run, did we need the image of Mr. Paternot dancing the night away in plastic pants?   Ellen DeGeneres's new sitcom, ''The Ellen Show,'' is built around the notion of an executive returning to her hometown after the collapse of her dot-com, but the show sits at the miserable ranking of 93rd for the season -- behind ''Emeril,'' the celebrity chef comedy -- despite Ms. DeGeneres's own considerable appeal.   To Amitai Etzioni, a sociologist at George Washington University, the country is experiencing an abrupt cultural shift away from the libertarian, individualistic values that were expressed in the celebration of the New Economy and toward more old-fashioned values in the wake of the terrorist attacks, when government is not The Problem and people are not The Market. ''There's been a sea change,'' he said. The surge in charitable giving and blood donations after Sept. 11, he said, underscores ''the sense that you're willing to give priority to the common good, to public safety and public health.''   Paulina Borsook, the author of ''Cyberselfish,'' a critical look at dot-com values published last year, said: ''People really crave a reminder of human bonds that have to do with sacrifice and fellowship and getting to know each other over time. It's not about changing jobs every six months and getting stock options.''   In the 90's, college students hoping to emulate Marc Andreessen of Netscape and other geek stars migrated to Silicon Valley or New York's Silicon Alley with thin resumes and visions of Testarossas dancing in their heads. That's all changing, said Thomas T. Field, director of the Center for the Humanities at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. ''Many of the young adults that I see coming to campus now say they want fulfilling jobs, not just ways of earning money,'' he said. ''Sounds awfully familiar, when you come from the 60's generation.''   Professor Field suggested that protests over globalism, and the sense of security that flourished during the boom, made young people more willing to question the status quo and to take chances. During the I.P.O. frenzy, he said, students could not wait to get out of school and begin earning. This year, many of his students have chosen to study abroad in China, Nepal, India and Egypt.   The country is in dot-com denial, Ms. Borsook said, adding, ''No one wants to admit that they were caught up in it,'' an attitude she calls ''I don't want to think that I drank the Kool-Aid.''   Good riddance, said Thomas Frank, the author of ''One Market Under God: Extreme Capitalism, Market Populism and the End of Economic Democracy.'' The book is a withering attack on the ideas underlying the selling of the New Economy, which he says co-opted hipness and the language of populism to serve greed and gain. The book has come out in paperback with a new afterword. ''It's going to take some time for it to sink in,'' Mr. Frank said. ''The Dow isn't going to go to 36,000, and the dot-coms aren't going to come back -- and a lot of people lost a lot of money.''   Though dot-com executives might seem irrelevant these days, the technologies they sold, by and large, are not, pointed out Paul Saffo, an analyst at the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park, Calif. ''People haven't stopped using the Internet,'' he said. ''The fact is that it is changing the world, and it has changed the world.'' People now expect to be able to buy a book or make an airline reservation in the middle of the night, ''and it's washed into the rest of their lives.''   Kevin Kelly, who as a longtime editor of Wired magazine helped create the heroic ethos surrounding dot-com entrepreneurs, acknowledged ''it came tumbling down with the towers.'' But Mr. Kelly insisted that these people would rise again. The generation of tyro executives who crashed and burned ''got better business education than they could if they had gotten a Harvard M.B.A.,'' he said. ''They didn't set out to learn, but, boy, they are much smarter now.'' He predicts that the last decade has been the ''layup'' for a true cultural revolution to come -- he could not be specific, and his words may strike many as more dot-com hyperbole.   It takes a special kind of gall for the same people who argued that the ''long boom'' suspended the laws of economics, and even unraveled the cycles of history, to fall back now on analysis of historical cycles to support their arguments.   But to believe any less goes against the American grain, argued Jason McCabe Calacanis, the editor of the now-defunct Silicon Alley Reporter. The dot-commer, seen today as a scam artist, will be reborn, he said, smarter and tougher, because he represents optimism itself. ''It's the belief that the future -- the individual's future and the future of the economy -- are going to be better in five years than they are today.''   But still. Take a look at the book ''Radical E'' by Glenn Rifkin and Joel Kurtzman, which offers ''Lessons on How to Rule the Web'' after the bust. It extols companies that truly understand how to marry the World Wide Web to business. ''After five tumultuous years of hype and hysteria,'' the authors promise, ''the real advent of the Web and e-business is now.''   One of the book's chief examples of a company that does it right, Enron, has been in the news a lot lately, though not because of astute exploitation of e-commerce. No, Enron -- which trades energy via the Web -- has seen its stock collapse 90 percent.    Photos: The giants of e-commerce, who walked among us, are culturally extinct now with a war on.

Business; Financial Desk  California Wary of Dynegy Bid to Buy Out Enron Energy: Both companies are prominent players in the state's power market. The move to combine their strength is raising some concerns.  NANCY RIVERA BROOKS  TIMES STAFF WRITER    11/25/2001  Los Angeles Times  Home Edition  C-1  Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company    Dynegy Inc. of Houston has been hailed as a hero on Wall Street, as it rides to deliver cross-town rival Enron Corp. from its self-inflicted ills and save energy markets from serious distress through its proposed $9-billion buyout of the world's largest energy trader.   But in California, Dynegy has a different image.  Dynegy, co-owner of several Southern California power plants, has been the quietest member of the \"Big Five\" group of energy producers commonly portrayed as villains by California politicians and regulators. Gov. Gray Davis and others have called Dynegy and its fellow energy suppliers \"gougers\" and \"pirates\" who manipulated the market and charged too much for electricity, precipitating California's blackout-studded energy crisis.   Partly because of the heightened political sensitivities to all things surrounding California's energy problems, the state is expected to play a central role in the proposed merger between Dynegy and Enron, antitrust experts and others say. The state's Attorney General's office already has begun scrutinizing the proposed combination.   If it merges with Enron, another favorite Davis target, Dynegy would be a powerhouse in energy trading, electricity generation and natural gas transmission. And the combined firm would have a strong presence in California, which some find troubling.   \"I would hope that the people who look at the antitrust implications would consider this one carefully,\" said state Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon), one of the architects of California's failed foray into electricity deregulation, who became a fierce critic of power producers and resellers. \"If anything, Dynegy would be in an even stronger position to be able to manipulate markets than it was before.\"   Dynegy agreed on Nov. 9 to buy Enron through a stock swap valued at about $9 billion and to inject $2.5 billion into crumbling Enron provided by cash-rich ChevronTexaco Corp., the San Francisco-based oil company that owns nearly 27% of Dynegy. But a continuing trickle of disturbing financial disclosures keep slamming Enron's stock price, indicating that investors have their doubts that the deal will be completed as negotiated.   The Enron purchase would hurl Dynegy, which is about a quarter of Enron's size, into the top ranks of energy merchants.   In California's energy world, Dynegy already is a key company. At every significant twist in the state energy crisis, Dynegy was there, although not as visibly as some of the other power-plant owners and electricity resellers.   Enron and Reliant Energy Inc., also of Houston, and Duke Energy Corp. of Charlotte, N.C., drew particular fire from politicians and consumer advocates during the last 18 months as energy leaped higher. But Dynegy also was accused by the state's grid operator of reaping excessive profit through its electricity bidding practices and, to a lesser extent, by holding back some electricity from its Southern California power plants.   In addition, Dynegy signed long-term electricity contracts with the state that have been singled out by critics for containing potentially lucrative clauses requiring that the state pay emissions costs and other costs.   The California Independent System Operator, which runs the long-distance power transmission grid serving much of the state, has asked federal regulators to ban Dynegy from selling power at market prices. Cal-ISO has made the same request concerning the other major power plant owners: Duke, Reliant, Atlanta-based Mirant Inc. and AES Corp. of Arlington, Va., which markets its power through an agreement with Williams Cos. of Tulsa, Okla.   \"Dynegy has sort of slid by under the radar,\" said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer & Consumer Rights, a consumer activist group.   \"Not only did Dynegy do very well, but particularly its trading and marketing division did very well over the course of the last two years. It profited wildly.\"   For its part, Dynegy rejects accusations of market manipulation, saying it has played a constructive role in the California marketplace, stepping forward to be one of the first companies to sign long-term contracts with the state when its need was greatest despite an electricity debt of $300 million owed the company by the state and its utilities.   \"Dynegy has acted ethically and responsibly in California,\" said Dynegy spokesman John Sousa. \"The fundamental problem in California is that supply did not keep up with demand.\"   \"Dynamic Energy\"   Accused of Overcharging   Dynegy was created in 1984 as a natural gas trading operation known as Natural Gas Clearinghouse to take advantage of the deregulation of natural gas prices. Under Chief Executive Chuck Watson, the company has expanded into natural gas processing and distribution and electricity generation, changing its name along the way to Dynegy, a word created by combining \"dynamic\" and \"energy.\"   In California, Dynegy owns power plants capable of generating 2,800 megawatts of electricity through a partnership with NRG Energy Inc. of Minneapolis. (A megawatt can supply about 750 average homes with electricity.)   The state's big investor-owned utilities were required to sell some of their power plants by the landmark 1996 deregulation legislation. By the end of 1998, the Dynegy/NRG partnership had purchased three large power plants in Long Beach, El Segundo and San Diego and a collection of 17 small \"peaker\" plants from Southern California Edison Co. and San Diego Gas & Electric Co.   Under the arrangement between the partnership, NRG operates the power plants and Dynegy markets the electricity from them. It is Dynegy's bidding practices in selling that power into state markets that put it, along with other energy producers, on the wrong side of the state grid operator and federal energy regulators.   Among the allegations:   * In a report released in March, Cal-ISO accused energy producers and resellers, including Dynegy, of overcharging Californians by $6.7 billion between May 2000 and March 2001. Power suppliers have denied the allegations. The report also found that Dynegy reaped about $32 million in \"monopoly rents\" between May and November of last year, or profits beyond what a competitive market would bear. That was the fourth-highest total for any company noted in the report. Enron was ranked sixth, taking $27.9 million in such profits.   * Cal-ISO said Dynegy maximized profits primarily through a practice known as \"economic withholding,\" or bidding electricity at prices so high that they would be rejected, thereby pushing up the price charged for the remaining generation sold into the market. Dynegy also did some \"physical withholding,\" Cal-ISO said, meaning that the company withheld electricity supplies to drive up the price.   * Dynegy was accused last April in hearings before state legislators of hoarding space on a key natural gas pipeline into California in 1998 and 1999, causing natural gas prices to soar. Dynegy executives testified that the charge was untrue.   * When federal regulators ordered $125 million in potential refunds for the first four months of the year, Dynegy's portion was the largest among the power sellers named, representing slightly more than one third. Dynegy said its prices were justified by high natural gas prices, emissions costs and other factors.   Dynegy President Stephen Bergstrom said in April that the company was \"unfairly and inaccurately accused of withholding power from the California market.\"   \"As we have repeatedly communicated to California policymakers and regulators and to industry officials, we remain ready and willing to generate and sell power to any and all buyers at fair and reasonable prices when they are able to provide appropriate assurances that they will fulfill their obligation to pay for those purchases.\"   A recent report by the state Department of Water Resources backs up Dynegy's assertions that its prices have been in line with the rest of the market.   During the first three months of this year, after sky-high prices pushed Edison and PG&E so close to insolvency that the state had to step in and buy power for their customers, Dynegy sold power to the DWR at an average price of $239.63 per megawatt-hour for electricity. That was slightly below the average of $268.90 per megawatt-hour charged by all sellers.   Dynegy portrays itself as a minor player in the California market, representing about 4% of the state's generation.   But Cal-ISO, in asking federal regulators to revoke Dynegy's authority to sell power at market rates, said \"Dynegy has profited systematically from the exercise of market power to the significant harm of California's electric consumers and economy.\" A decision is pending.   Officials reviewing the Dynegy-Enron merger will closely review the companies' operations in California.   Although Enron owns no power plants in California, it is believed to have long-term contracts with some generators, although spokesman Eric Thode refused to detail them.   In addition, Enron has a hand in 25% of the energy trades around the nation, with a significant portion of that in California. Thode would not detail California operations, citing company policy.   Finally, Enron controls an undetermined amount of natural gas, which is used to generate about one-third of the state's electricity, through its transwestern pipeline, which crosses into California, and through natural gas marketing and trading arrangements.   It is those largely unregulated energy trading operations that have many energy watchdogs worried. They say that middlemen such as Enron and Dynegy can drive up the price of power by reselling it at higher prices each time.   A lawsuit filed in May against the Big Five generators by Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, acting as a private citizen, described it this way: \"The Dynegy trading floor, working with the trading floors operated by Williams, Mirant, Reliant and Duke Energy is one of the principal tools the defendants used to inflate the price of electricity within their respective markets, as well as throughout the state of California.\"   \"These defendants engaged in trading of electricity futures, forwards, options and other risk products that had the effect of manipulating and inflating the price of electricity within their respective markets,\" the suit charged.   \"These defendants engaged in 'megawatt laundering,' in which they made trades with the primary purpose of inflating the costs of electricity within their respective markets.\"   State Is Examining Proposed Merger   California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer has begun examining what effects such a merger would have on California, spokeswoman Sandra Michioku said. The Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission also will scrutinize the merger in a process that Dynegy and Enron expect will take no more than nine months.   Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) said she plans to urge FERC to look beyond traditional measurements of how much the companies own in the market to examine \"inputs\" into the market such as gas pipeline capacity controlled by the companies and gas trading by Dynegy and Enron.   \"It really raises many questions about how the market works,\" Bowen said.   Opposition by California could be a severe hindrance to the merger, said Garret Rasmussen, a lawyer with Patton Boggs in Washington, D.C., and formerly a Federal Trade Commission antitrust investigator.   The state, if it chooses, could play as pivotal a role as it has in negotiations over the antitrust settlement between the federal government and Microsoft Corp., he said.   \"While this administration has been quite tolerant of mergers ... an action by the California attorney general could have a significant chance of success,\" Rasmussen said.   Merger Might Reopen Contract Negotiation   The proposed merger might give California leverage to renegotiate its power contract with Dynegy, which contains the unusual provision that the state would pay for any emission costs that the company incurred, said V. John White, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency & Renewable Technologies in Sacramento. Dynegy's large San Diego plant lacks crucial pollution control equipment, he said.   \"The California attorney general needs to carefully examine Dynegy's environmental stewardship activities and renegotiate that provision in the long-term contract,\" White said. \"Dynegy has a Texas, the-least-we-can-do attitude as far as the environment is concerned.\"   David Freemen, the former Los Angeles Department of Water & Power general manager who helped negotiate Dynegy's and other long-term contracts, said that while opportunities to renegotiate may present themselves, the agreements, now maligned as too expensive, were key to stabilizing the electricity market. Freeman praised Dynegy for its part in that process.   \"There's a difference between companies that bargained hard with us and reached agreement--like Dynegy, Calpine and Williams--and those that were reaching for the moon and we didn't reach agreement,\" Freeman said. \"Dynegy knew that they wanted to do business in California, and do it in a businesslike manner.\"    PHOTO: Enron chairman and chief executive Kenneth Lay, left, and to Chuck Watson, chairman and chief executive of Dynegy, announce the companies' proposed merger during a news conference in Houston.; ; PHOTOGRAPHER: Associated Press   Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Business; Financial Desk  JAMES FLANAGAN  Enron's Troubles Could Spur Securities Reforms  James Flanigan    11/25/2001  Los Angeles Times  Home Edition  C-1  Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company    Ultimately, the fall of Enron Corp., the onetime rising star of the energy industry, may be remembered as a landmark in the annals of securities law and shareholder rights.   The firm's practices are under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Enron is the focus of numerous shareholder lawsuits that seek to recover damages from the $60-billion plunge in the company's value in the last year.  The Enron case could result in new securities laws, experts say. It also could result in massive damage awards because of the extent of stockholder losses. Shares sold at more than $84 apiece a year ago, and at $36 a month ago before the emergence of hidden losses sent the price reeling downward to current levels below $5 a share. (The stock closed Friday at $4.71 on the New York Stock Exchange.)   Significantly, two suits against Enron charge that the firm's top executives breached their fiduciary duty of loyalty and prudence by failing to inform Enron employees of dangers to the company's finances while those employees held Enron stock in their 401(k) retirement plans.   The firm's troubles raise fundamental questions of what a company owes shareholders in the management and understandable disclosure of its accounts.   But Enron's predicament also goes to the heart of the U.S. financial system, says former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt. Enron \"represents a lack of the kind of disclosure that is fundamental to maintaining confidence in U.S. public markets,\" Levitt says.   Enron, technically speaking, disclosed in annual reports and proxy statements for 1999 and 2000 the existence of partnerships that in some cases \"acquired debt and certain equity securities of certain Enron subsidiaries.\" But it did not disclose the significance of the partnerships, nor did it consolidate their transactions in its reports to shareholders and the SEC.   Its references to the partnerships were in footnotes to financial statements, written in the arcane legal language typical of such documents. For example, disclosure of one partnership, LJM Cayman, read in part: \"LJM received 6.8 million shares of Enron common stock, subject to certain restrictions and Enron received a note receivable and certain financial instruments hedging an investment held by Enron.\"   Enron entered into at least 33 partnerships, attracting investments from pension funds and other investors in return for pledges of Enron stock at a guaranteed value. One partnership held 12 million Enron shares, which at one point were worth more than $1 billion.   Yet until this year, Enron treated the partnerships as insignificant to its overall business, and so they were not required to be included in its overall accounts.   By treating its partnerships as non-consolidated subsidiaries, Enron could report lower debt burdens than it actually had, thus strengthening its credit and enabling itself to grow into the largest energy trader in the world.   Enron became a pioneer of energy trading, a way of using financial techniques of trading forward commitments in natural gas and electricity to establish future prices on long-term supply contracts. As the business boomed, Enron's revenue soared, from $20 billion in 1997 to $100 billion in 2000. Through three quarters of this year, the firm was on course to exceed $200 billion in revenue.   But in October, Enron announced that it had lost more than $600 million in the third quarter and that it needed to reduce shareholder equity by more than $1 billion due to transactions with one of its partnerships.   Then on Nov. 8, Enron restated its accounts back to 1997, acknowledging that some of its partnerships should have been included in company accounts all along. The restatement resulted in a reduction of reported profit by more than $500 million. Enron's board of directors and auditors had ordered the restatement, the firm said.   The stock price fell further, lawsuits ensued and Enron sought refuge in a merger with Dynegy Inc. Enron's financial position and stock price have weakened since the merger announcement Nov. 9., so the Dynegy deal may go through at a reduced price, says analyst Stanley Foster Reed, who runs MergerCentral.com, an online information service.   But the question remains of how such a large, significant company could collapse with so little advance notice.   Enron was a prominent company, not least because of Chairman Kenneth Lay's connections to the White House as formal energy advisor to the first Bush administration and as informal advisor to the current Bush administration.   The firm had more than 20,000 employees before recent layoffs, and it had millions of investors through the holdings of pension funds such as the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the college teachers retirement plan TIAA-CREF and major mutual funds. Yet for all its prominence, Enron's disclosures about its business were inadequate. \"Disclosure\" sounds like a technical term, but it is the principle behind the laws passed in 1933 and subsequent years to regulate securities markets and protect the public.   Companies issuing stock to raise financing from public investors are required to disclose accurate and complete information about their business and to have accounts certified by independent public accounting firms. The SEC, created in 1933, could not stop a company from issuing stock, but it could make it disclose all relevant facts about risks in its business.   The laws were written in the midst of the Great Depression, which followed the 1929 stock market crash. They were designed to remedy abuses such as the case of Charles Mitchell, head of City National Bank (a predecessor firm of today's Citgroup), who sold his own company's shares short--that is, he bet on their price declining--just before the crash, without informing other shareholders. Before securities laws, Mitchell had no legal requirement to disclose his activities; once the laws were passed, all top managers and directors of public companies had such legal, fiduciary duty.   The Enron case probably will lead to new laws regulating investments in subsidiaries, experts say. The SEC staff has contemplated such regulations in the past but never made them law.   And the fallout from Enron could lead to tighter restrictions on firms putting their stock in employee retirement accounts. Also, it could lead to tighter regulations on statements by top managers on the condition of the business.   \"This will be a case, with major issues of concealment from shareholders,\" says San Francisco attorney Steven Siderman, who is preparing a class-action lawsuit against Enron and Arthur Andersen, Enron's accounting firm.   Enron executives gave no indication of the company's troubles as late as August, when Jeffrey Skilling, president and chief executive for only six months, abruptly resigned. In response to questions of trouble in the company, Skilling said, \"There's nothing to disclose. The company's in great shape.\"   Lay, who stepped back into the top post, told employees in August that Enron's business was strong. \"We've got a lot of great stuff going on and we're not getting credit for it in the marketplace, but we will,\" Lay said.   However, both Lay and Skilling had been selling Enron stock for more than a year at that point, Lay cashing out more than $140 million in stock options and Skilling more than $60 million in options.   Meanwhile, employee 401(k) accounts, heavily laden with Enron stock, were frozen this year because the firm changed account managers. Employees were stuck as the stock plummeted.   The principle behind securities laws is that management of a public company, with so many employees, pensioners and other institutions depending on it, is a public trust.   The charge in the lawsuits being filed against Enron is that the firm, its executives and directors betrayed that trust.   Everyone is entitled to a fair trial, and Enron and its executives will surely have many days in court in the months and years to come in which to defend against the charge of betrayal of shareholders and employees.   The Enron case will be a landmark.   *   James Flanigan can be reached at jim.flanigan@latimes.com.

Financial  Hooked On a Fast- Growth Habit; CEOs Reach for Double-Digit Results Despite Downturn, and Some Are Making Costly Mistakes  Steven Pearlstein  Washington Post Staff Writer    11/25/2001  The Washington Post  FINAL  H01  Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved    At this point, they almost can't help themselves -- it's become an addiction for the top executives of Corporate America.   Delivering double-digit earnings growth year after year is no longer simply what corporate re-engineers call a \"stretch goal\" for an organization, or a rare achievement to be celebrated. It's become a mandate, a benchmark, a test of corporate manhood, an expectation hard-wired into the corporate culture -- a narcotic that company leaders reach for the way most people reach for an aspirin.  Never mind that the economy is contracting, or that prices are falling and profit margins are getting squeezed, or that most industries are unlikely to grow more than 5 percent a year even after the recovery is here. The name of the game these days is boosting the stock price, and the surest way to do that is to promise -- and deliver -- double-digit profit growth to Wall Street's cadre of analysts and money managers.   It's not just in the tech and telecom sectors, where the inflated growth expectations first took root. The addiction to double-digit growth has spread across the corporate landscape to firms in older, mature industries desperate for the \"growth company\" moniker that qualifies them for Wall Street's highest reward: a stock price equal to 20, 30, even 40 times their expected annual earnings.   In the 1990s, \"we went through a period of extraordinary high growth in profitability, and both managers and stock analysts have unthinkingly come to the conclusion that that was the norm,\" said Michael Jensen, a professor of finance at the Harvard Business School. \"Top-level management came to believe they could get a big company to grow 20, 30, 40 percent year after year -- it was insanity. And in the process of trying to make that real, rather than acknowledging it was a transitory phenomenon, more than a few wound up destroying shareholder value rather than enhancing it.\"   Jensen said that it is now common for Wall Street earnings expectations to be the starting point for corporate budgeting and strategy-setting rather than the result of it. \"Nothing could be more irresponsible,\" he said.   James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis, says this fascination with high growth rates peaked in 1999, at the height of the stock market boom, when only 50 stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index -- the hottest 50 growth companies -- actually went up in value. In fact, these nifty 50 went up so much so that they lifted the overall market indexes with them. The other 450 stocks declined.   \"At that point, investors were only paying for growth,\" Paulsen said. \"Dividends, good cash flow, reliability -- they all meant nothing.\"   \"If you were just growing at a stodgy 8 or 9 percent a year, you were neglected, ignored,\" said Jeremy Siegel, finance professor at the Wharton School of Management at the University of Pennsylvania. \"You couldn't get good valuations.\"   In desperation, boring old electric utilities refashioned themselves into \"merchant energy companies,\" while highly profitable pork producers added new product lines in order to be viewed as ready-to-eat food companies. And perfectly good retail companies threw millions of dollars into misguided Web ventures.   With the dot-com bust and the broader stock market collapse over the past year, many executives, investors and analysts claim to have learned their lesson and reduced expectations for growth. But according to Siegel, Paulsen and other experts, expectations remain unreasonably high by historical standards. Many of those executives, investors and analysts believe business to be in a temporary lull before the \"norm\" of double-digit growth reasserts itself sometime next year.   \"Most people's expectations are still way too optimistic,\" said Bill Miller, the legendary manager of Legg Mason's Value Trust, a $12 billion mutual fund.   David Nadler, chairman of Mercer Delta Consulting, says this \"tyranny of growth\" continues to lead too many companies to expand too quickly, make ill-advised acquisitions or diversify out of their areas of expertise. \"The experience on that is that their shareholders wind up paying dearly for those mistakes,\" he said.   Indeed, many of the celebrated corporate crackups of the past year -- think of Conseco Inc.'s costly foray into manufactured-home financing, Providian Financial Corp.'s debacle with sub-prime credit card lending, Freightliner LLC's truck glut and the record $50 billion write-off of acquisition costs by JDS Uniphase Corp. -- came about as a result of companies trying to push earnings growth to the limit.   Corporate executives certainly have plenty of incentive to play the growth game, whether consciously or unconsciously. Most have multimillion-dollar compensation packages that include bonuses, stock and stock options, all tied directly to growth in earnings and share price. And a rising stock price gives them a valuable new currency -- currency that can be used to buy short-term earnings growth through mergers and acquisitions and to offer valuable stock options when recruiting top management and technical talent.   The stock option has a particularly pernicious impact, according to David Morrison, vice chairman of Mercer Management Consulting Inc. and co-author of \"The Profit Zone.\" Options become more valuable as the price of the company stock rises above the point at which the options are issued. On the other hand, if things go bad, it doesn't matter how much the price of the stock goes below the \"strike price\" -- the value remains zero. As a result of this asymmetry between upside potential and downside risk, says Morrison, it is common for executives to take bigger risks with their companies than they otherwise would have.   Ego also plays a role. Chief executives who deliver year after year of double-digit earnings growth wind up being lionized in business books, on magazine covers and on cable-TV news shows. They are invited to serve on other corporate boards and to speak at investor conferences organized by celebrity analysts. Their boards of directors give them wide latitude in running the company.   By contrast, CEOs who don't have a good growth story to tell, or can't deliver on it, risk finding themselves in early retirement.   Jeff Garten, dean of the Yale School of Management, recently interviewed 40 of the leading corporate chief executives for a new book, \"The Mind of the CEO.\" And more often than not, Garten said, the executives told him off the record that while they knew the expectations about earnings growth are often unreasonable and unsustainable, they had no choice but to participate, or risk being dismissed as someone who simply \"doesn't get it.\"   \"The system penalized anyone who didn't play the game,\" Garten said. As a result, executives find themselves on a treadmill -- always in a desperate search for ways to deliver the next increment of growth that will justify the unrealistic earnings expectations in which they themselves were complicit.   Analyst William Steele said he has seen it time and again in the consumer products sector that he follows for Bank of America Securities Inc., as companies that had always been \"solid singles hitters\" suddenly started swinging for the fences.   \"What you've seen is companies making ill-advised acquisitions, abusing their balance sheets [by taking on too much debt or issuing too much stock] and under-investing in their brands,\" said Steele.   Take the case of Freeport, Ill.-based Newell Co., which for more than 30 years had enjoyed steady earnings growth by buying up underperforming housewares companies and \"Newellizing\" them -- bringing in new management, cutting costs, scrapping unprofitable products, consolidating distribution and winning more space on retail shelves. But by the late 1990s, after 75 acquisitions that included Calphalon cookware, Levelor window blinds and Rolodex card files, the number of good turnaround prospects had dwindled. And with growth in sales of consumer products slowing to single digits, Newell executives needed something that would keep them in double-digit territory.   That something, they thought, was Rubbermaid, for years one of the most respected companies among executives and investors, but one that had stumbled badly beginning in 1996. It was far and away Newell's biggest acquisition, bought with newly issued Newell stock valued at $5.8 billion, a 50 percent premium over Rubbermaid's market price at the time.   The Rubbermaid deal closed in the spring of 1999, and Newell Rubbermaid's financial performance has declined ever since, a reflection not only of the slowing economy but of problems within the company itself. Total profits for the combined firm are barely higher than they were before the acquisition, and because of the debt taken on and new shares issued to finance the purchase, the best measures of financial performance -- earnings per share and return on assets -- have both declined. After the company repeatedly failed to meet the quarterly sales and growth target it had promised Wall Street, chief executive John J. McDonough was fired in October of last year.   Given that history, the current economic uncertainty and continued weakness in quarterly earnings, one might think that Newell's new executive team would steer clear of making grand promises to Wall Street. But in June, after barely six months on the job, the new chief executive, Joseph Galli Jr., told Wall Street analysts that a restructuring program he had instituted would allow the company to post a 15 percent earnings increase in 2002. At $26, analysts say the stock price now reflects an expectation that Newell Rubbermaid will meet this double-digit growth target.   In an interview last week, William T. Alldredge, Newell's chief financial officer, explained that the 15 percent growth target for next year was reasonable because the company's profits this year, against which next year's will be compared, are so depressed. Going forward, however, he acknowledged that growth rates would be closer to 10 percent than 15 percent, and they would come from squeezing more profit out of existing brands rather than through acquisitions.   \"I'm not sure we see the enormous upside potential that we once did,\" said Alldredge, who insisted, nonetheless, that Wall Street should continue to value Newell Rubbermaid as a \"growth company.\"   To this day, \"old-fashioned\" chief executives such as Warren Buffett remain puzzled as to why executives still can't resist the urge to promise investors any particular level of earnings growth, given all the uncertainties of running a business. In the annual report to shareholders of his Berkshire Hathaway Inc. in February, he noted that only a handful of companies have ever been able to sustain 15 percent earnings growth for more than a decade. Such promises, he said, not only spread \"unwarranted optimism\" among investors, he said, but \"corrode\" behavior by top executives -- in some cases behavior so corrosive that it spills over into deceptive accounting. As it turns out, the chief executives of Sunbeam, Xerox, Waste Management and Enron all lost their jobs in recent years after major-league earnings overstatements were uncovered during their watch.   (Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is a significant investor in The Washington Post Co., which, like Berkshire, provides no earnings guidance to Wall Street investors.)   James Johnson, the former chairman of Fannie Mae, has heard all these criticisms, and can even add a few of his own. But he said that for every company that overpromised and overreached, there were others where the focus on earnings growth has led to breakthrough innovations, successful new corporate strategies and big gains in productivity.   \"It's what makes American capitalism so unique -- and so successful,\" said Johnson, whose ability to deliver on a promise of double-digit earnings growth in every year but one led to a dramatic increase in Fannie Mae's stock price during his tenure. It also made Johnson a very rich man.   \"It's a tricky balance,\" said David Winters, president and chief investment officer of Mutual Series Fund Inc., a New Jersey-based mutual fund. \"You don't want companies to be sleepy, or set the bar so low that they can easily step over it. But you don't want companies that overpromise and underdeliver.\"   Certainly no chief executive took the goal of posting double-digit earnings growth each year more seriously than John F. Welch Jr., who recently retired as chairman of General Electric Co. On Jack Welch's watch, division managers who failed to contribute to the corporate goal were routinely fired or had their divisions sold off. And critics have charged that the unrelenting pressure led, on occasion, to accounting gimmicks and questionable business practices -- a charge Welch repeatedly denied.   Yet according to Noel Tichy, a professor at the University of Michigan Business School, it was the demand for double-digit earnings growth year after year that forced managers of GE's old-line manufacturing divisions to get into the growing and profitable business of servicing and financing the turbines and medical equipment they made.   \"I don't know when it would ever be the right decision not to try to grow fast,\" said Tichy, co-author of a book titled \"Every Business Is a Growth Business.\" And even while acknowledging that companies have been known to do dumb things in the pursuit of earnings growth, the good ones don't.   \"If you don't have goals that force executives to stretch themselves and their organization, you don't optimize performance,\" Tichy said.   Business guru James Collins disagrees. In a new book, \"Good to Great,\" Collins argues that the companies that sustain really high growth rates over long periods of time are those that don't set growth as an explicit goal. Rather, Collins says, the best companies operate less out of some corporate bravado than a determination to understand their business and their success and to capitalize on that understanding.   \"Great companies don't come about because the CEO wants to be a celebrity or please the share-flippers, and certainly not because he or she wants to hit the top targets on the compensation plan,\" Collins said last week. \"The common thread among the CEOs of the truly great companies is that their ambition is to build something that can outlast themselves. The growth comes as a byproduct of that.\"   Harvard's Jensen said that the only way to lick Corporate America's growth addiction is for more executives to muster the courage to stand up to Wall Street and begin setting realistic expectations for their companies. Such a strategy might occasionally require a CEO to tell investors that his company's stock is overvalued -- a truly novel idea in today's environment, where executives almost reflexively complain that their share price is too low. And it might require executives at some companies to make clear that their stock may be inappropriate for growth funds and hedge-fund managers.   \"Companies generally get the shareholders they deserve,\" said Miller, Legg Mason's money manager.   But Norman Augustine, the retired chairman of Lockheed Martin Corp., warns that \"standing up to Wall Street\" may not be as easy as it sounds.   \"We all sit around complaining about the short-term mentality on Wall Street and the fund managers who say they'll dump our stocks if we don't show double-digit earnings growth every quarter,\" Augustine said. \"And then the manager of our own corporate pension fund comes in and says, 'We have two funds that didn't do well for us this quarter, so I dumped them.'   \"And there it is,\" Augustine said. \"We have met the enemy, and it is us!\"      http://www.washingtonpost.com   Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.      The Enron scandal  A V Rajwade    11/26/2001  Business Standard  10  Copyright (c) Business Standard    Enron has always been recognised by other companies as best practice in risk management. It put in systems to manage risks on a real-time basis and had very strong management.\" James Lam, founder of eRisk, a consulting firm.   As an occasional teacher and more regularly a student of the subject of management of price risks, I have been an admirer of Enron's elaborate disclosure of its risk management practices. And yet, in a cascade of events over a period of just three weeks from mid-October, it lost two-thirds of its share value, became the subject of a US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation, and was taken over by a rival a third in size. (Latest reports create some doubt about whether this will go through.) What went wrong?  No, the events had nothing to do with Dabhol. Indeed, if, for us in India, Enron will always be associated with the controversial power project, elsewhere it is likely become a case study for students of accounting, finance and general management. (On second thoughts, even its Indian adventures would make an excellent case study!)   But first, a recount of what happened. After announcing on October 16, without much explanation or transparency, that it has taken a charge of $ 1.2 billion against equity, Enron's share price started tumbling. Apparently, the charge was the result of some financial transactions, and the SEC launched an investigation. The chief financial officer (CFO), who was directly involved with the transactions, the company's treasurer and a couple of other senior officials were sacked.   Perhaps most damagingly, Enron revised its accounts from 1997 onwards, reducing profits by about $ 600 million and increasing debt by a somewhat similar amount. As a result, Enron's credit rating was downgraded.   It seems the root problem was not in its basic business of power and gas trading, but in its investment activities controlled by the CFO. These comprised private equity, and Enron's share in each of the investee companies was kept artificially below 50 per cent to avoid consolidation of accounts. To this end, outside investors were brought in and assured of equity in Enron itself, should the value of the investee company(ies) fall below agreed threshold(s).   All this was done to keep the losses in investments off-balance sheet, and mitigate their impact on reported profits. Many other US corporations including J P Morgan Chase, which had large private equity investments, have suffered on this score (see World Money October 15). Enron wanted to avoid this and, last year, paid its since-dismissed CFO $ 30 million for his creative accounting genius.   Incidentally, those enamoured of US GAAP and its alleged superiority over the rest of the world should note that all these gimmicks were blessed by the company's auditors one of the Big Five firms, which was paid $ 25 million as audit fees and $ 27 million for other services by Enron last year.   The restatement of the accounts from 1997 onwards became necessary as the Enron management/board and the auditors were forced, on review, to admit that at least some of the transactions should have been on, rather than off, balance sheet. Details of all the transactions in question are yet to come out, but what has come out is bad enough.   But this apart, a billion dollar hit for a company of the size ($ 300 billion) or cash flow ($ 3 billion) of Enron is, by itself, hardly a death warrant. But it turned out to be just that for Enron.   Perhaps because it was too arrogant? Perhaps also because its accounts lacked transparency and their opaqueness ensured that investors' confidence was always somewhat fragile?   But there are two other points worth noting: the professionalism of equity analysts and whether the event restores somewhat the balance between trading and producing. As for the first, the professional analysts were surely aware of the opaqueness of the accounts,but few questioned the management aggressively on the subject. Perhaps the stock was too glamorous and typified the spirit of the times trading assets was what the \"masters of the universe\" did, not the boring old business of producing oil or power or cars. The Enron management itself was proud of the way it operated in its principal activity of trading in power and gas, with Skilling, the former CEO, claming that \"we are on the side of angels. We are taking on the entrenched monopolies. We are bringing the benefits of choice and free markets to the world.\" (The quotation is from an interview in BusinessWeek, prior to Skilling's inglorious exit from Enron a couple of weeks before the bubble burst).   For the analysts, there was also safety in numbers. Skilling claimed that \"Enron's operations are built around the integration of modern financial technologies and physical technologies\", bringing derivatives theory to trading in power and gas! Obviously, the fate of Long Term Capital Management has not led to more sober management of trading risks.   Surely the role of \"markets\" should be to reduce the distance, and cost, between producer and consumer? One does feel that there is something perverse in a society that values, in terms of compensation, the trader (don't forget this is just a euphemism for the speculator) over the producer whether in the bond, currency or power and gas markets. The markets and, indeed, greed obviously have a role to play, but surely the pendulum needs to swing a little bit to the left?    Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Enron wants to sell its 65 percent stake in Dabhol Power,  India's biggest foreign investment, at cost. The project is mired  in a tariff dispute over $64 million in bills that haven't been  paid by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its only  customer, for eight months.         ``One more bidder will increase competition, which is  welcome.         ``Any step in the national interest is good.         ``Cheap energy is always in the national interest since we  want to increase electricity generation and sell it at a  reasonable price.         ``I can't comment on the time-frame of buying out the Enron  stake until the legal wrangles are solved.

An investment would ease concern that Enron's weakened  finances may prompt Dynegy to pull out of or renegotiate the terms  of the transaction, which is valued at $23 billion in stock and  assumed debt.         Enron is seeking an additional $500 million to $1 billion in  cash but wouldn't divulge details. ``We are not going to discuss  the particulars of who we are talking to,'' said Enron spokeswoman  Karen Denne.         Shares of the Houston company fell by 48 percent in the past  three trading sessions. At Friday's closing price of $4.71, the  stock sells for less than half the $10.85 that Dynegy is slated to  pay in the acquisition. That's a sign investors are skeptical the  transaction will go through as planned.         Enron is likely to have approached Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts &  Co., the Blackstone Group and the Carlyle Group for a private  equity investment, said industry analyst David Snow of  PrivateEquityCentral.Net. The firms have declined to comment.         On a conference call Nov. 14 Enron Chief Financial Officer  Jeffrey McMahon said the company is in talks with several private  investors and expects to receive $500 million to $1 billion from  these sources.         On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on  a $690 million note due this week, giving the company more time to  restructure its finances. Dynegy Chief Executive Chuck Watson said  he was ``encouraged'' by the commitment to extend the note  payment, as well as the closing of a $450 million credit facility.  He said Dynegy remained committed to the purchase.         Enron already received $1.5 billion in cash Nov. 13 from  ChevronTexaco Inc. as part of the Dynegy buyout agreement. In  return, Dynegy will acquire preferred stock and other rights in an  Enron unit that owns the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.         Barron's reported over the weekend that Dynegy may have a  difficult time walking away from the deal because its right to the  pipeline might be challenged by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and  Salomon Smith Barney Inc., who accepted the asset as collateral  for $1 billion in loans to Enron.         Dynegy spokesman John Sousa declined to comment on Enron's  attempts to secure financing or whether more cash for Enron is a  condition of keeping the merger alive.         Enron's dealings with affiliated partnerships have led to a  federal investigation of the company, which restated its earnings  and saw its credit ratings cut.         The company said in a Securities and Exchange filing a week  ago that it has less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines  left.    --Mark Johnson in the Princeton newsroom (609) 750-4662      FREE AND CLEAR OF ENRON'S WOES  Edited by Sheridan Prasso   By Stephanie Anderson Forest    11/26/2001   BusinessWeek   Page 16   (Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)   Back in Enron's heyday, one of its rising stars was Rebecca Mark. Nicknamed ``Mark the Shark'' because of her ferocious ambition, she made her name in the early '90s building the energy giant's international operations, including the now-troubled Dabhol power plant in India. Once rumored to be a successor to Enron CEO Ken Lay, she resigned from Enron in August, 2000, after two years of heading Enron's ailing water company spin-off, Azurix .   These days, as Enron struggles to stay afloat, Mark-Jusbasche (who hyphenated her name with that of her husband of two years) is watching the action from the sidelines. And she'd like to keep it that way. ``I'm very surprised and saddened by [what has happened at Enron], and I wish them all the best,'' she says. Beyond that, Mark-Jusbasche, 47, is not much interested in talking about Enron, which is being acquired by a small rival after a spectacular Wall Street flameout. Mark left Enron with millions of dollars worth of Enron shares, although she says she has sold them since.   Mark-Jusbasche spends most of her time serving on advisory boards, both at Yale and Harvard business schools, as well as the school where her 16-year-old twin sons from a previous marriage are sophomores.   In her spare time, she seeks out opportunities for investing. Currently, Mark-Jusbasche is considering alternative-energy and water-technology companies. A farm girl from Missouri, she has one investment focus that's especially dear to her heart: looking into expanding her cattle ranches.

COMPANIES & FINANCE UK - Enron seeks survival pact to aid Dynegy's $9bn rescue.  By ANDREW HILL and SHEILA MCNULTY.    11/24/2001  Financial Times  (c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved    Crisis-hit Enron is seeking to extend its survival pact with its key lenders long enough to be rescued by Dynegy, the rival energy group.   Dynegy said it was \"continuing with confirmatory due diligence\" for its all-stock rescue bid. The offer is still worth $9.3bn ( #6.5m), even though Enron's market capitalisation has halved this week to $3.5bn.  Enron's survival is crucial to the smooth running of the electricity and power markets, where it claims to be the principal in 25 per cent of all transactions.   Enron sought to allay fears that Dynegy might change the terms of its offer, or withdraw.   Withdrawal of the rescue bid would call into question Enron's credit ratings, which remain one notch above \"junk\" status. Ratings agencies held off downgrading Enron two weeks ago, because such a decision would trigger repayment of debt issued by off-balance-sheet partnerships that Enron used to support its rapid expansion over the past two to three years.   Even so, the terms of recent credit lines extended to Enron suggest lenders already regard the company as a non-investment grade risk. The bonds are trading as though the company is heading for a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing.   Glen Grabelsky of Fitch, the rating agency, said there were two possible outcomes for Enron: \"One is that the transaction goes through; and the other is that the viability of this company is in question.\"   Enron's shares fell to $4.74, a further 5.4 per cent drop, in a shortened session of trading yesterday morning in New York, as investors continued to express concern about Dynegy's commitment to the deal.   John Olson, vice president of research at Sanders Morris Harris, the Houston-based investment banking and securities firm, said: \"With Enron trading at 4 bucks and change it might make sense for them to go into bankruptcy and salvage this thing the right way.\"   Observers close to Enron say Wednesday's decision by JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup to finalise a $1bn secured credit line, and the deferral of a $690m repayment of notes due next Tuesday, have reduced the pressure on the group. If Dynegy were to renegotiate the terms of its deal - and that may depend on legal clauses within the original merger agreement - that would not affect Enron's financial situation, they say.   As well as negotiating with its lenders through the weekend, Enron is also seeking further investments from JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup and private equity firms in an attempt to shore up confidence. www.ft.com/enron.

By Andrew Kelly    11/25/2001  Reuters English News Service  (C) Reuters Limited 2001.    HOUSTON, Nov 25 (Reuters) - After climbing utility poles in all kinds of weather for 35 years, Roy Rinard was hoping to retire in a few years, but that was before the collapse in Enron Corp.'s stock price devoured his retirement savings.   \"I'm basically wiped out,\" said Rinard, 54, who works for Portland General Electric, an Oregon utility company acquired by the Houston-based energy trading giant in 1997.  \"I'm right back to ground zero and I'll have to go on working as long as I can,\" said Rinard, who suffers from arthritis and a lung condition that leaves him short of breath.   Encouraged by Enron's then-strong performance and the company's bullish view of its future prospects, Rinard moved all of the money invested in his 401(k) retirement account into Enron stock earlier this year.   But it proved to be a costly decision as the value of his account fell from $470,000 a year ago to around $40,000 today.   Rinard now hopes a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Houston will recover at least some of his money.   The suit, filed on behalf of Enron employees by Seattle-based law firm Hagens Berman, alleges that Enron breached its fiduciary duty by encouraging its employees to invest heavily in Enron stock without warning them of the risks of doing so.   Enron's stock, which peaked at $90 in August 2000, closed at $4.74 on Friday, after falling sharply in recent weeks amid a series of damaging financial disclosures.   A broadly similar suit filed by the Keller Rohrback law firm, also Seattle based, alleges that another Enron employee, Pamela Tittle, lost $140,000 on Enron stock held in her retirement account.   According to that suit, the Enron retirement savings plan had assets worth $2.1 billion at the end of last year, including $1.3 billion, or 62 percent of the total, in Enron stock.   DOUBTS EMERGE ABOUT DYNEGY DEAL   Enron, a former Wall Street favorite, agreed to be bought out earlier this month by smaller energy trading rival Dynegy Inc., but continuing problems at Enron have caused some analysts to question whether the deal will be completed.   Doubts have also been expressed about a planned sale of Portland General to Northwest Natural Gas .   Hagens Berman plans to seek class-action status for its suit and says 21,000 Enron employees could be eligible to join it.   The suit alleges that Enron \"locked down\" 401(k) retirement accounts on Oct. 17, preventing employees from changing the investments they held in their accounts until Nov. 19.   During that period Enron reported its first quarterly loss in four years and took a charge of $1.2 billion against stockholders' equity as a result of off-balance-sheet deals that would later come under investigation by U.S. regulators.   In that time, Enron shares fell from $30.72 at the close of trading Oct. 16 to $11.69 on Nov. 19.   Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said employees' access to the accounts was blocked as part of a previously planned change in the administration of the retirement plan and that the measure was in effect from Oct. 26. to Nov. 19.   Steve Lacey, a 45-year-old emergency repair dispatcher who has worked for Portland General Electric for 21 years, said the measure came at a time when bad news about Enron was flying thick and fast, driving the stock price down at a dizzying pace.   \"We couldn't take our money out of Enron stock into another portfolio. Basically they had us locked down to where we had no say over our own future,\" he said.   Lacey declined to quantify his own losses but said he and many of his colleagues had invested most of their retirement funds in Enron stock because it had performed better in the past than the other investments available under the Enron plan.   Denne said Enron employees were normally able to choose among 18 different investment options, but Enron's matching contributions were always made in the form of its own stock.   Lacey said he felt sorry for older colleagues at Portland General who had suffered a heavy financial blow just before they were due to retire, adding that he was only beginning to realize how serious the consequences could be for himself.   \"My goal was to have an extremely comfortable retirement and that may be a little clouded now,\" he said.

All Rights Reserved.        Canadian Oil and gas companies on high alert after terror alert    11/25/2001   The Canadian Press   Copyright (c) 2001 The Canadian Press. All rights reserved.   VANCOUVER (CP) _ Canadian oil and gas companies are on high alert after being warned that Islamic terrorists loyal to Osama bin Laden may be planning to blow up energy installations and pipelines in North America.   The warning, issued last week by the American Petroleum Institute, said ``such an attack would allegedly take place in the event that either bin Laden, or Taliban leader Mullah Omar, are either captured or killed.''   The alert was distributed to select officials of utility companies throughout North America by the institute, the industry's official voice.   It said the information ``that Osama bin Laden may have approved plans to attack natural gas supplies'' is currently ``uncorroborated,'' pending further FBI checks.   But it advised utility companies that ``the planning that went into the Sept. 11 attacks strongly suggests that terrorist cells are already established inside the U.S. and may simply be awaiting instructions to strike.''   ``Failing to strike a high-profile blow against targets on American soil will raise the question of Taliban and al-Qaida legitimacy in their global fight against the United States.''   The institute did not identify the source of the information nor potential targets. It is understood the RCMP have been notified of the alert.   B.C. Gas spokesman Dean Pelkey said it has received the alert and will ``stay vigilant.''   The priority, he said, is pipeline security.   ``Some additional precautions have been taken but I do not want to go into any details,'' Pelkey said.   A security analyst, who asked not to be named, said measures taken by Canadian utility companies are likely to include restricting access to sensitive areas, a high-profile presence with guards and closing off areas such as above-ground wells and pipeline junctions.   Aerial surveillance of pipeline routes and installation of remote-sensing devices may also be part of the plan.   ``Generally, underground pipelines and storage facilities are difficult to target,'' he said.   ``What is key when you are dealing with Islamic terrorists is to prevent the use of suicide bombers and car bombs to attack above-ground installations.''   In addition to B.C. Gas's hundreds of kilometres of gas pipelines and storage facilities, security has also been stepped up at B.C. Hydro's 29 dams, four thermal plants and 1,825 kilometres of major transmission lines.   Even before last week's alert, the Alberta government formed a ministerial security task force to enhance security at energy production and transmission facilities.   The facilities include Edmonton's Refinery Row, Fort Saskatchewan's petrochemical and chemical projects and the pipeline network.   That includes the collector point at Empress, Alta., east of Calgary near the Saskatchewan border, the petrochemicals plants at Joffre, Alta., east of Red Deer, and Fort McMurray's oilsands project.      USA: FERC rule on natgas shipping needs more work-industry.  By Chris Baltimore    11/21/2001   Reuters English News Service   (C) Reuters Limited 2001.   WASHINGTON, Nov 21 (Reuters) - The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) proposal to loosen scheduling rules for natural gas pipeline shippers, meant to boost competition and supplies, could have the opposite effect, some companies and industry groups told the agency this week.   FERC proposed the changes last month to enhance competition on the U.S. interstate natural gas pipeline grid by allowing gas shippers to make same-day changes to their schedules to meet changing supply and demand.   The changes are supported by the American Gas Association, which represents U.S. gas producers.   FERC stepped in after the Gas Industry Standards Board (GISB), the industry's self-regulating rulemaking body, failed to reach consensus on the issue.   Current GISB standards require pipeline operators to wait at least a day before changing their preset shipment schedules, which slows the market's ability to react to changing conditions, FERC said.   Instead, FERC proposed allowing pipeline shippers to make same-day changes in schedules.   The agency's comment period on the proposal, which ended on Monday, produced a mixed reaction from pipeline operators and industry groups.   The Electric Power Supply Association (EPSA) warned FERC in a written filing the change could reduce the flexibility of electric generators to obtain natural gas supplies.   The trade group, which represents independent power generators and marketers, asked FERC to limit pipeline operators' authority to change schedules to give power plant operators greater supply certainty.   A group representing pipeline owners also expressed concern.   The Interstate Natural Gas Association of America said the new rules could \"increase market volatility and thereby could reduce flexibility and reliability for other parties.\" The pipeline group asked FERC to clarify some language in the rule to allay concerns.   A Dynegy Inc letter to FERC also warned the rule could degrade reliability.   An Enron Corp. subsidiary agreed the changes could increase flexibility and competition, but raised concerns that newly available capacity might not be offered equitably to market participants.   Enron and El Paso Corp. , which owns one of the largest U.S. pipeline systems, asked FERC to hold a technical conference on how the changes would be implemented.   Williams Cos Inc. , which owns gas production and pipelines, said it favored the measure but asked FERC to give industry enough lead time to change their systems to accommodate it. The company also asked FERC to \"grandfather\" existing capacity arrangements to exempt them from the requirements.   Gas producers said they welcomed the proposed change in pipeline scheduling rules.   The American Gas Association, which represents major gas producers, said the measure would boost competition in the U.S. natural gas market. The changes would also \"better ensure continued reliability of natural gas service, enhance daily balancing abilities and make more capacity available on the interstate grid,\" the group said.  ",

		"_body" : "At the October 24, 2001, FERC Sunshine meeting, the following items were discussed:    Kern River Firm Customers' Rehearing Request Denied (C-6, C-8 on agenda):    Called by Linda Breathitt, these are two Kern River expansion applications [CA. Action Project, CP01-69; 2002 Expansion, CP01-106] that have received certificates.  The draft orders deny rehearing requests by Firm Customers who charge that additions will cause further  pro rata allocations at Wheeler Ridge.  The draft order states that the benefits of the project outweigh \"any potential adverse impact to existing customers?\" and that \"the solution to the problem of pro rata curtailments at Wheeler Ridge lies not with interstate pipelines, but with resolving the problems of take-away capacity on SoCalGas?.\"  Hence, the orders reason that Kern River has satisfied its obligations to its customers, and the current lack of intrastate capacity \"cannot be laid at [Kern River's] door.\"    Breathitt is filing concurrences to these two orders to highlight the important issue of FERC's response to intervener allegations of insufficient take-away capacity related to interstate expansions.  Though Breathitt doesn't dissent from the rehearing denial, she wants to underscore the importance of the Commissions' acknowledgement of the role that possible degradation of existing rights plays in the determination of the public need and necessity for pipeline expansions.  She also states that she is \"uneasy\" about FERC's \"strident policies\" in favor of adding pipeline facilities despite possible inefficiencies and constraints, and she reiterates that FERC's mandate under the NGA goes beyond making sure pipeline gets into the ground.  She notes that the Commission will revisit the take-away capacity issue in another Kern River expansion application, CP01-422 [2003 Expansion Project].    Brownell Calls for Development of Regional State Relations Panels under Auspice of \"Electricity Market Design and Structure\" NOPR, RM01-12 (E-5 on agenda)    Though  the issuance of a NOPR is not apparently imminent, under this discussion item Nora Brownell announced that she has sent a memo to the other three Commissioners recommending the development of some internal structure to coordinate communications between FERC and state commissions.  The need for such coordination emerged from obvious frustration expressed by state commissioners during RTO Week.  To get this process going, Commissioner Brownell asked staff to pursue a structure, perhaps a type of regional panel, with the mission to strengthen federal/sate relationships.  Considering the magnitude of RTO development, FERC likely will need to have dedicated staff work on this.  Chairman Wood requested that Dan Larcamp, Director of OMTR, bring a proposal to the Commission at the next meeting on how to implement a structure.  While all three other Commissioners supported Brownell's proposal, Commissioner Massey noted that there's already been seven years of \"process\" and input on RTO formation and that any new structure should be developed \"in a way that gets us to an endgame\" concretely and clearly.    Western Infrastructure Reports Lay Baseline for FERC Adequacy Conference in Seattle    Staff presented multiple detailed reports on data and background material gathered to lay the groundwork for discussions at next month's Western Infrastructure Adequacy Conference in Seattle on November 2 [similar conferences will be held regionally across the country].    The conference is a FERC \"fact-finding mission\" which will seek to answer three primary questions:  (1)  Is the current energy infrastructure in the West adequate?  (2) What are the infrastructure needs for the region?  (3) What factors inhibit investment in the development of adequate energy infrastructure?    While the presentations seem to focus primarily on electric transmission, the conference will cover all energy delivery systems.  The overriding question on all fronts is what needs to be done, and who needs to do it.  The powerpoint presentations made by Staff are already available on FERC's website at <http://www.ferc.gov/calendar/commissionmeetings/discussion_papers.htm>     \"RTO Week\" Update     Staff updated the Commissioners and public on the week of RTO panels held at FERC last week.  Staff is preparing and organizing a document outlining \"what Staff heard,\" which will be posted on FERC's website this week.  The document is intended to give focus to reply comments from stakeholders.  Staff also suggested that there may be a need to hold smaller, more focused Staff sessions to \"dig deeper?.\"  According to Staff, while there seemed to be some consensus at the 10.000 mile high level, more specific issues emerged which may require further discussion.    Lengthy Updates and Discussion on Two RTO Mediations (Southeast, Northeast), Midwest RTO Progress    In the Northeast and Southeast RTO mediation cases, Staff and the mediating Judges briefed the Commissioners on where the ordered mediations left off, what proposals and options are now on the table, and what next steps may be necessary.  These mediation reports will be available online (by end of week).  What is not clear is when the Commission is going to vote on RTOs - there were no votes at the meeting, only discussion.    In the Midwest, both MISO and ARTO are ready for operations, and MISO and SPP are also prepared to merge.  While Commissioners discussed specifics of all the Midwest proposals, again no vote was taken or any indication given as to when a vote may occur.    ETS Draft Orders Issued:    ? Northern Natural, RP00-223-005:  Northern's Limited Firm Transportation [\"LFT\"] tariff sheets were approved, including two additional LFT sheets concerning the Carlton surcharge.  ?

That's one expected result of a county board's decision yesterday to allow  the former Encina power plant in Carlsbad to churn out several times more air  pollutants, called oxides of nitrogen, than allowed before the power crisis.  The county Air Pollution Control District Hearing Board made the decision by  a 4-1 vote.          State may have claim on further overbilling  Continuing coverage: California's Power Crisis  ?     The five-unit Encina plant is now called the Cabrillo plant, owned by  Cabrillo Co. The pollutants, called NOX, help form the region's most  widespread air pollutant -- ozone.  If the Cabrillo plant can burn natural gas all this year, its excess NOX  emissions will be offset by new NOX controls on other businesses. No  additional days of unhealthy ozone would occur, said Steven Moore, senior  engineer for the county air district.  But natural gas is expected to be in short supply, partly because several  smaller plants that require gas are expected to begin operating in San Diego  County this summer.  When gas is cut off to Cabrillo, it must switch to burning more polluting  fuel oil.  \"If they burn fuel oil, it will be a different story. There will be  significant ozone increases,\" Moore said. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ---  State may have claim on further overbilling     Leaders fault FERC, call for tougher action By Craig D. Rose  UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER  March 17, 2001  Federal energy regulators said again yesterday that California may have paid  too much for power, this time citing some $55 million in possible overcharges  during February that could be subject to refund.  But like last week -- when the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission found  possible January overcharges of $69 million -- a broad spectrum of state  leaders said the new refund is a pittance compared with the billions of  dollars that power companies are extracting from the state each month for  electricity.  The January electricity bill for San Diego Gas and Electric and the state's  two other major utilities was $5.2 billion. February's total is expected to  be higher.  Federal regulators said yesterday that they notified six electricity  suppliers that sales exceeding $430 per megawatt-hour during Stage 3 alerts  -- emergencies called when power reserves are nearly exhausted -- would be  subject to refunds, unless the suppliers can justify the sale prices on the  basis of costs.  A FERC official said whatever refunds were ordered would probably be in the  form of credits to utility companies, used to offset other power purchases.  Houston-based Dynegy faces the largest possible payment, with a potential  liability of $23 million for the month. A spokesman said the company was  still studying the FERC finding, which was issued yesterday.  \"What we have said all along is that, given the market conditions, the prices  we have charged will be found to be just and reasonable,\" said Dynegy  spokesman Steve Stengel.  A spokeswoman for Williams Energy Services Corp., which faces possible refund  payments of $22 million, said the Tulsa-based company was unsure whether the  price level set by FERC was adequate for recovering all the costs associated  with producing power.  Other suppliers facing possible refunds are Duke Energy, Portland General  Electric Co., Reliant Energy and Mirant, formerly a unit of Southern Co.  Under federal law, regulators must assure that wholesale power prices remain  \"just and reasonable.\" Despite repeated pleas from state leaders to cap  prices, FERC allowed prices in California's deregulated power market to soar  from $40 per megawatt-hour last spring to 10 times that level in recent  months.  The costs have created a state crisis of monumental proportion, leading Gov.  Gray Davis and state lawmakers to plan a repair package that is expected to  include more than $20 billion in state borrowing and possibly rate increases  for consumers. The state is buying electricity on behalf of the utilities.  Last week, FERC said it would order refunds for all Stage 3 sales above $273  per megawatt-hour in January, unless generators can justify their prices. The  federal commission said it allowed a higher threshold for February because of  increased costs for natural gas, the primary fuel for producing electricity.  But consumer groups said the $430 cutoff for possible power refunds belied  FERC's insistence that it's policing the deregulated market. For an SDG&E  customer using 500 kilowatt hours monthly, for example, a $430 per  megawatt-hour charge would translate to an electricity bill of $250.  \"What I see is that FERC wants to present the appearance that it is  disciplining the market, but what they are doing is coddling,\" said Michael  Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network.  \"If I were a power generator, I would be thrilled.\"  Harvey Rosenfield, president of the Foundation for Taxpayer & Consumer Rights  in Santa Monica, criticized the FERC refund finding as \"laughable.\"  \"In attempting to protect energy generators against greater retribution, FERC  has acknowledged that deregulation has failed, that there is no free market  and the public has been gouged,\" Rosenfield said. \"The only question now is,  how much?\"  The state's grid operator, which recently said California may have been  overcharged by more than $500 million during December and January, indicated  that it might challenge the FERC findings, in order to press for larger  refunds.  For one thing, the Independent System Operator said it had evidence of  overcharging during periods other than Stage 3 emergencies. The state's grid  manager also noted that the FERC established its refund price threshold by  considering only the power industry's most inefficient generating facilities.  \"We are encouraged by FERC's actions of late, but they have not gone far  enough,\" said Steve Greenleaf, director of regulatory policy for the  Independent System Operator.  Davis, who has pressed FERC to set firm limits on the wholesale price of  power, agreed with the ISO.  \"At long last, FERC is finally recognizing what we have been saying for  months -- that generators have been unfairly soaking California ratepayers,\"  he said. \"However FERC is taking only baby steps.\"  Attempts to reach FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert were unsuccessful. Commissioner  William Massey, who has called for lower price caps, said that the FERC  orders are allowing the vast majority of power sales to be excluded from  possible refund.  Massey added that the power bill for California's three major utilities,  which leaped to $28 billion last year from $7 billion in 1999, could soar far  higher.  \"The projection for this year is $70 billion,\" Massey said. \"This agency  needs to wake up because this is turning into a disaster.\"  Rep. Bob Filner, D-San Diego, said he believed FERC was beginning to yield to  pressure from the state for action.  \"It is clear they are under pressure, but they are using data that is most  favorable to the industry,\" Filner said. \"But their action gives credibility  to those of us who have said all along these generators are gouging the  state.\"  In other action yesterday:  ?PG&E Corp. said it would transfer $1.1 billion from a federal tax refund to  its troubled utility unit, which is seeking billions in compensation for  costs it says it incurred buying power for its customers.  The parent companies of PG&E and Southern California Edison have been  criticized for draining billions from their respective utility units in  recent years.  Consumer groups and others oppose additional payments to the utilities, but  the governor has said he will not allow them to go bankrupt.  ?Davis will spend more than $51 million over two years on consultants to help  negotiate power contracts and on an advertising campaign to educate the  public about energy conservation.  The Governor's Office released copies of the contracts yesterday afternoon.  They range from $25,000 to $40 million in cost and include contracts for  legal and financial assistance.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------------------------------------    OPEC Cut Cited in Call to Boost U.S. Oil Output  Energy: Cartel's decision to trim production by 4% could raise fuel prices as  summer approaches.   By DAVID WILLMAN, Times Staff Writer   ?????WASHINGTON--With consumers facing a possible increase in gasoline prices  at the pump, President Bush's Energy secretary said Saturday that the  decision by major foreign oil producers to slash output emphasizes the need  to increase production within the United States. ?????\"OPEC's decision [late Friday] demonstrates the importance of increasing  America's domestic production and developing a national energy policy that  will ensure a stable, reliable, affordable and diverse supply of energy,\"  Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said. He added: \"There is an urgent need to  strengthen America's energy security.\" ?????Abraham's comments came in reaction to an agreement by the Organization  of Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut its targeted oil output by 4%--1  million barrels a day. The action by the 11-nation cartel could raise prices  for crude oil and the refined gasoline that powers Americans' automobiles and  trucks. ?????The cutback will take effect April 1, OPEC said. The nations' output  quota will fall to 24.2 million barrels a day from the current level of 25.2  million barrels. OPEC members pump almost 40% of the world's oil. ?????Abraham called OPEC's action \"disappointing.\" His staff said he would  assess what he termed America's \"energy crisis\" at a conference Monday in  Washington, hosted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ?????For Americans who remember well the long lines at gasoline pumps and the  inflationary spiral driven by energy prices of the 1970s, current conditions  may seem short of crisis proportions. But the specter of higher gasoline  prices as the summer travel season approaches--combined with the ongoing  power crunch in California and other Western states--presents the Bush  administration with a serious challenge. ?????Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) called on Bush to consider using the  nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve to ease the effect of the foreign  producers' announced cutback. ?????\"With the U.S. economy sagging, the net result of this decision [by  OPEC] will only fuel speculation about a possible recession,\" Schumer said  Saturday. \"Higher oil prices mean more of a financial burden for everyday  consumers, which would likely mean economic stress in the very countries OPEC  counts on to buy its oil.\" ?????Former President Clinton authorized tapping the strategic reserve during  the 2000 presidential campaign, when pump prices rose to more than $2 a  gallon in some areas after years of stability. ?????The OPEC production announcement comes just days after Bush renounced a  pledge he made during that campaign to trim America's emissions of carbon  dioxide, the odorless gas suspected of contributing to a warming of the  Earth's atmosphere. Bush's turnabout pleased U.S. business leaders who viewed  the decision as prudent for the domestic economy--but others saw it as a  potential step backward from leadership on the threat of global warming. ?????Abraham did not specify how or where he would like to see the U.S.  increase its energy production. But Bush has made clear that he favors a  broad approach, including opening the pristine Arctic National Wildlife  Refuge to exploration. ?????Bush's position puts him at odds with environmental organizations that  have long opposed opening the refuge. Over the last week, for instance, the  Audubon Society has placed television ads calling for opposition to drilling  in the refuge, located on Alaska's North Slope. ?????A Gallup survey conducted early this month questioned 1,060 Americans  about the seriousness with which they viewed the nation's \"energy situation.\"  The response: 31% viewed it as \"very serious,\" 59% chose \"fairly serious\" and  9% said \"not at all serious.\" ?????Other responses in the same poll suggested that Bush faces a challenge  if he is to persuade Americans to back increased production to meet energy  needs. When asked to choose from three \"potential solutions,\" 56% favored  more conservation by consumers, compared with 33% who favored emphasizing  production of more oil, gas or coal. And 8% said they favored \"both equally.\"  The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ---------------------  Groups Look for Silver Lining in Energy Crisis  Power: From auto makers to water officials, they cite the electricity  situation in their efforts to reverse government decisions and rules they  oppose.   By JULIE TAMAKI and JENIFER WARREN, Times Staff Writers   ?????SACRAMENTO--While legislators and lobbyists groan that the energy crisis  is monopolizing the spotlight this year, some enterprising folks have seized  on events to advance their agendas. ?????Exhibit A is an effort by auto makers to dodge a state mandate requiring  them to offer thousands of electric cars, beginning with the model year 2003. ?????Manufacturers call the cars impractical and unmarketable, and have  resisted the mandate for a decade. So when the state Air Resources Board  began considering a proposal to weaken their demand for smog-free cars  recently, auto makers sensed an opening. ?????Reminding the board of California's energy crunch, industry  representatives said recharging thousands of electric cars would only  exacerbate the problem. ?????But the California Energy Commission disputed that notion, saying the  cars would have a trivial effect on power supplies. The cars are typically  recharged at night, when demand for power is low, the commission notes. And  most of them won't be on the road until after 2003, when several new power  plants should be on line. ?????S. David Freeman, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water  and Power, accused the auto makers of \"playing off public uncertainties and  blackout threats.\" ?????As it turned out, the air board reaffirmed its mandate by a unanimous  vote. ?????\"It is really time to get on with the business of progress,\" board  member William Friedman told a General Motors official before the vote. \"And  progress will be made when we stick it to you to make you do what you need to  do.\" ?????Another group looking for an angle in the energy crisis is the  California Manufacturers & Technology Assn., which has asked Gov. Gray Davis  to reconsider the state's overtime rule. ?????The rule requires many employers to pay their workers higher wages after  an 8-hour day. But, citing the energy crisis, the manufacturers want Davis to  reconsider it. ?????\"We hope that some flexibility . . . will be addressed as a means to  offset aggressive conservation programs,\" said Gino DiCaro, the group's  spokesman. \"If we have companies that . . . shut down for half the day, they  may want to make up production later.\" ?????A coalition of labor, consumer and environmental groups have fired back,  opposing any efforts by \"corporate interests to capitalize on the crisis  mentality to weaken labor and environmental protections.\" ?????No word from the Davis administration so far. ?????In the San Joaquin Valley, the giant Westlands Water District cites  power woes in its lawsuit to block former U.S. Interior Secretary Bruce  Babbitt's decision to bolster flows to Northern California's Trinity River. ?????The suit cites diminished supplies for power users and farmers as  reasons the decision should be blocked. Sacramento Municipal Utility District  officials contend the amount of water at stake generates enough energy to  supply 31,000 Sacramento-area homes when it flows through hydroelectric  plants in the Sacramento River Basin. ?????Westlands' actions have drawn the ire of Indian tribes that fish for  salmon and Trinity County officials. ?????\"It's hypocritical for Westlands and others to claim harm to  California's power resources from increased Trinity River fishery flows when  the state and federal water project pumps into the Delta enough power to keep  a city the size of San Francisco lit up,\" said Tom Stokely, Trinity County's  senior planner. ?????Bush administration officials say they are prepared to defend Babbitt's  decision. A court hearing on Westland's lawsuit is scheduled for Monday. ?????\"It is appropriate that the Department of Interior maintain the position  it had and allow the court to now make its decision,\" said Sue Ellen  Wooldridge, deputy chief of staff for Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --------------------- Power Firms Told to Justify Prices or Refund $55 Million  Electricity: Regulators act after issuing a similar order last week for $69  million in payments. Lawmakers say the action doesn't go far enough.   By RICHARD SIMON and NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, Times Staff Writers   ?????Federal energy regulators on Friday ordered six wholesale power  suppliers to refund an additional $55 million to California if they cannot  justify the prices they charged in February. ?????The order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission was the agency's  second in two weeks responding to accusations by California officials that  energy companies have reaped excessive profits from the electric supply  shortage in the West. ?????FERC last week ordered 13 power suppliers to justify or refund $69  million to California utilities for power sold in January. ?????The proposed refunds represent a small portion of what California  officials are seeking. ?????Also on Friday, news that some alternative energy producers may be  lining up to shove Southern California Edison into Bankruptcy Court sent the  stocks of the parent companies of Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric Co.  plunging. ?????Edison executives said they believe they stand a good chance of  deflecting an involuntary bankruptcy petition, if one is filed, but  acknowledged that they need to resolve their money problems soon. ?????\"There's no doubt about it, time is not our friend here,\" said Ted  Craver, chief financial officer of Edison International, parent of Southern  California Edison. ?????Wholesale electricity prices skyrocketed last May and never returned to  earth, prompting accusations that electricity suppliers were gouging  Californians and harvesting hundreds of millions in windfall profits. Edison  and PG&E have amassed $13.8 billion in electricity debts that have left them  unable to pay their bills. ?????Electricity company officials said Friday they are prepared to defend  the prices charged in each month. But on Capitol Hill, California lawmakers  complained that the FERC action did not go far enough, saying the prospective  refunds should have been much larger. ?????\"This sounds like a step backward instead of the aggressive action we  need from FERC,\" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). ?????She questioned FERC's decision to order possible refunds only for  electricity sold in excess of $430 per megawatt-hour during Stage 3 alerts in  February. ?????\"Before the energy crisis started in California, electricity was selling  at an average wholesale price of $30 a megawatt-hour,\" she said. \"And now  FERC is saying a baseline of $430 a megawatt-hour is a reasonable cost.  Something is really wrong here.\" ?????FERC officials did not respond to requests for an explanation of how  they arrived at the figure of $430 per megawatt-hour. By contrast, they had  determined that $273 per megawatt-hour was the highest reasonable price the  suppliers should have charged in January. ?????The FERC order cited a complex formula that based the price for February  on such factors as natural gas prices and higher costs for generators to  comply with air pollution rules. ?????In other action, FERC announced plans to hold an April 6 meeting in  Boise, Idaho, to discuss price volatility in the West with state and energy  officials. ?????A number of California officials have accused FERC of acting timidly in  response to the high energy costs that have left PG&E and Edison on the edge  of fiscal collapse. ?????But Rep. Bob Filner (D-San Diego) welcomed Friday's action on refunds.  \"The overcharges have been so egregious that even FERC, which doesn't want to  admit it, has to say something went wrong. ?????\"It's a start,\" Filner added, \"and it may help to change minds on  Capitol Hill\" in support of government-imposed price controls on wholesale  power supplies. But he said refunds are far from certain. ?????Indeed, the energy companies said they expect to persuade FERC to uphold  the prices charged in February and January. ?????Steve Stengel, a spokesman for Houston-based Dynegy, which was asked to  justify $23.4 million in charges, said his firm has been running its power  plants nonstop and deferring maintenance to help California through the  energy crunch. ?????\"Dynegy has done everything it could do to be part of the solution,\"  Stengel said. \"We feel that what we have charged has been just and  reasonable.\" ?????Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Houston-based Reliant Energy, which  faces $7.4 million in potential refunds, echoed that sentiment. \"We've  conducted our operations legally and ethically,\" he said. ?????Asked about the company's profits, Wheatley said, \"I think it's high  time that the generation companies quit apologizing for good management.\" ?????Tom Williams, a spokesman for North Carolina-based Duke Energy, said his  company's prices were justified by premiums for environmental penalties and  fears of the lack of credit-worthiness in California. Duke was asked to  justify $2.1 million in charges. ?????Also ordered to justify their prices were Williams Energy Services  Corp., $21.6 million; Portland General Electric Co., $73,600; and Mirant,  $826,000. The wholesalers have until next Saturday to make their case to FERC. ?????In Sacramento, Steve Greenleaf, director of regulatory policy for the  California Independent System Operator, which runs the power grid for 75% of  the state, said: \"We're encouraged by FERC's action of late.\" But he added,  \"Quite honestly, it doesn't go far enough.\" ?????Gary Stern, director of market monitoring for Edison, said the FERC  order is flawed because \"it applies refunds only to hours of Stage 3 alerts,  which . . . excuses millions of dollars in excessively priced [power].\" ?????A Stage 3 alert is declared when electricity reserves fall below 1.5%. ?????Edison and PG&E have stopped paying most bills, including money owed to  producers of alternative energy. Creditors are becoming increasingly  irritated at the failure of the utilities and Gov. Gray Davis to reach a  settlement that will allow the utilities to pay their bills. ?????One such producer, Coram Energy Group, a small windmill farm in  Tehachapi, said it will sign a petition that could force Edison into  involuntary bankruptcy proceedings. At least two other creditors must sign  the petition before Edison can be forced into Bankruptcy Court. ?????In another potential precursor to bankruptcy, an alternative energy  producer called Caithness Energy won a lien Wednesday in federal court in  Nevada against Edison's stake in the Mohave power plant near Laughlin, Nev. ?????The turmoil sent investors fleeing Friday. The stock of PG&E Corp.  dropped $1.50, or 11.6%, to $11.42, while Edison International tumbled $1.35,  or 9.9%, to $12.24. Both trade on the New York Stock Exchange. ?????If an involuntary petition were filed, Edison believes it could persuade  a bankruptcy judge during the mandated 20-day waiting period not to accept  the case, said Edison lawyer Barbara Matthews. ?????\"We believe we have solid ground to oppose, not the least of which is  the Bankruptcy Court doesn't need to intervene\" because solutions are being  pursued in the Legislature and in the governor's office, Matthews said. ?????PG&E executives said that the San Francisco company has no utility  assets outside of California that creditors can seek to attach and is aware  of no petitions circulating among creditors to put PG&E into involuntary  bankruptcy. ?????California law forbids placing a lien against utility assets without a  prior approval by state regulators. ?????In fact, bankruptcy talk has reinvigorated negotiations with advisors to  Davis to sell the PG&E transmission grid to the state as part of a broader  settlement, said Peter Darbee, PG&E Corp. chief financial officer. ?????Edison reached a tentative agreement three weeks ago to sell its  transmission lines, but has yet to reach a final deal. ?????\"We think there's reason to be cautiously optimistic,\" Darbee said. ?????In other developments Friday: ?????* Preparing for a summer of tight energy supplies, the Public Utilities  Commission proposed an overhaul of a controversial program in which  businesses won reduced rates in exchange for having to go dark during power  shortages. The \"interruptible\" program had caused businesses to lay off  employees when their power was cut for weeks at a time.  ?????The PUC said new members of the program would not have power cut for  more than four hours a day or 40 hours a month; existing customers' cuts  would be limited to six hours a day. ?????* A day after Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham predicted long blackouts  this summer, the PUC also tinkered with the way power is cut in California.  The commission asked utilities to tell customers what block of circuits they  are on. If that block must be blacked out, they could be warned by the news  media.  --- ?????Simon reported from Washington and Rivera Brooks from Los Angeles. Times  staff writer Nicholas Riccardi contributed to this story. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --------------------- Hard-Boiled Bidding for Kilowatts  Water agency said to be in over its head as a trader  David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer Sunday, March 18, 2001  ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle  URL:  http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/18/M N159243.DTL   Sacramento -- The last line of defense in coping with California's energy  crisis is a narrow, windowless room in a former department store on the  outskirts of the state capital.  There, a handful of men and women huddle over computer screens on a couple of  folding tables for as long as 14 hours a day. Junk-food wrappers and bags of  candy share the cluttered space with detailed charts and analyses.  The numbers flash across the monitors -- offering prices from power companies  stretching from Canada to Texas. There is little time to think. Within  seconds, the traders are committing millions of dollars in public funds to  secure enough electricity to keep California's lights on.  This is, most people agree, not a good way for the state to be buying  electricity.  \"I'm sure we've made a lot of mistakes,\" said Thomas Hannigan, director of  the state Department of Water Resources, which has been delegated by Gov.  Gray Davis to purchase power on behalf of near-bankrupt utilities.  By nearly all accounts, the luckless bureaucrats at the DWR are being torn to  shreds by professional energy traders, who see in California's power-  purchasing plan a golden opportunity to make off with billions in extra  profits.  \"It's like being in a lion cage or a snake pit, however you want to define  it,\" Hannigan said. \"We've definitely gotten burned. That goes without  saying.\"  In fact, state officials estimated last week that the DWR is shelling out  roughly $350 million a week on the volatile electricity \"spot\" market and  will have spent almost $4 billion by the end of the month.  At this rate, the state will use up by the end of July the entire $10 billion  authorized by the Legislature for power purchases.  CALPIRG CALLS IT GOUGING \"The state is clearly being taken advantage of,\" said Dan Jacobson, consumer  program director of the California Public Interest Research Group. \"It looks  like the power generators are gouging us for as much as they can.\"  Leading power companies deny that they are artificially driving electricity  prices higher or that they are gouging California consumers. But not one was  willing to speak on the record about how well the DWR is doing in the  frequently cutthroat energy business.  Several industry sources said they had been advised not to discuss the DWR's  performance since a trading manager at Bonneville Power Administration in  Portland, Ore., was quoted as saying that California's new electricity buyers  \"agree to prices that make you wonder.\"  The manager, David Mills, told the Wall Street Journal that the DWR is so out  of its depth that he has instructed Bonneville's traders \"to cut California  some slack\" by occasionally offering cut-rate prices.  A Bonneville spokesman said last week that Mills had been misquoted, but the  damage already was done: The DWR is now widely perceived in energy circles as  a pushover.  'NO LEVERAGE IN THE MARKET'  This does not sit well with DWR workers, who insist they are doing the best  they can under highly difficult conditions.  \"We have done a good job considering that we have no leverage in the market,  \" said Viju Patel, executive manager of the DWR's power systems department.  \"We are dealing with very aggressive traders, and they have the advantage.  It's a seller's market.\"  This is new for the DWR, which oversees the state's water assets --  aqueducts, dams, irrigation -- and until now has confined its power buying  largely to long-term contracts needed to keep pumps operating during  electricity shortfalls.  That changed in December when the Independent System Operator, manager of  California's power network, contacted the department during a shortage and  asked the DWR to buy about $20 million worth of juice to help avert  blackouts.  Subsequent purchases placed the DWR almost $43 million in the hole. It has  yet to recoup its costs from the ISO and the utilities that ultimately used  the power for customers -- and which subsequently have defaulted on paying  their power bills.  \"We made that deal only on a handshake,\" said Hannigan, the DWR's director.  \"But we couldn't say no, could we?\"  As California's troubles worsened, and as Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and  Southern California Edison grew increasingly unable to meet customer demand,  the governor realized a state agency would have to ride point in tackling the  energy crisis.  Davis turned to the DWR. Simply put, the department's admittedly limited  experience in the electricity market was still the most extensive he could  find.  \"This was all new to us,\" Hannigan said. \"When the crisis landed in our lap,  we reacted basically by applying a flood-management mentality to it. Crisis  management is crisis management.\"  SECRET LOCATION, INFORMATION Thus, the DWR responded to the governor's marching orders by establishing an  emergency center in the brick-covered facility it shares with branches of the  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Weather Service.  The so-called Joint Operations Center occupies a renovated department store  in an otherwise mundane Sacramento shopping mall.  DWR workers deliberately ask reporters not to say where exactly the facility  is located. They're concerned that disgruntled consumers will vent their  frustration over high energy prices by attacking the building, as the man who  rammed a truck into the state Capitol in January allegedly did.  The makeshift \"Grid Operations Center,\" where power is now being purchased,  is tucked away behind a locked door on the third floor. Sonny Fong, the DWR's  emergency preparedness manager, watched nervously as a recent visitor cast  his eyes over the whiteboards on the room's walls.  The boards list all the power companies with which the DWR is trading and the  prices that each is charging California for electricity.  \"Don't write any of that down,\" Fong admonished. \"It's secret information. We  can't let any of that get out.\"  Keeping a lid on its activities has become a full-time job for the DWR. For  example, Fong adamantly refuses to allow anyone to speak with the  department's traders, even during breaks in the action.  \"If I let you do it,\" he said, \"I'd have to let everyone do it.\"  Similarly, Patel, the power systems manager, said he could not under any  circumstances open his desk drawer and show a visitor one of the 40 long-term  contracts signed by the DWR this month with generators.  SEEKING ACCESS TO CONTRACTS Access to the contracts, involving about $40 billion in public funds, has  been sought by lawmakers, consumer groups and a number of media  organizations, including The Chronicle.  In response, the governor's office has insisted that disclosure of specific  contract terms would jeopardize the DWR's bargaining position and thus be  contrary to \"public interest.\"  \"If I let you see them, I would have to let everyone see them,\" Patel said.  He did acknowledge, though, that the contracts contain so much legal  gobbledygook that \"you probably would not understand them in any case.\"  It's Hannigan, as head of the department, who has signed his name to each of  the contracts. Yet even he admits he has only a loose grasp of the details,  which were hammered out by teams of lawyers.  \"We got the best deal we could get,\" Hannigan said.  He observed, however, that the DWR's negotiating stance was weakened by the  generators' awareness that blackouts will not be tolerated by California's  leaders -- even with a summer of dire shortages on the horizon.  This allowed the power companies to really tighten the screws in seeking the  best possible sales terms.  \"They know this summer will be one big barbecue,\" Hannigan said. \"They won't  stop until they drain all our resources.\"  LEARNING TO BE ADVERSARIAL The DWR is unaccustomed to adversarial relationships in tackling a crisis. In  the event of a flood or earthquake, the department's crisis teams normally  meet with full cooperation from others when organizing countermeasures.  But with the current energy crisis, the DWR is scrambling to mount a suitable  offense while simultaneously playing defense against profit-hungry power  companies.  \"It's been a learning experience for us,\" said Fong, who has been helping  coordinate emergency responses at the department for years. \"We didn't know  what we would be up against.  \"With a flood,\" he added, \"you can see the direct impact. With this, you  can't really get a handle on things.\"  Fong and other DWR officials are quick to note that the department has  brought in outside energy experts from Navigant Consulting and Deloitte &  Touche.  \"We may not be up to the task,\" Fong said. \"We may not know how to play the  market. But we've brought in people who do.\"  Dominic Young, the Deloitte partner helping guide the DWR through the jungle  of the energy business, sees the department's burgeoning street smarts as a  work in progress.  \"Does the DWR have a trading floor like Duke or Reliant?\" he asked, citing  two of the biggest players in the power game. \"No, they do not. If they want  to stay in this business, they clearly need to improve.\"  NEW FACILITY The department is trying to do just that. Next week, the DWR's electricity  traders are expected to move from their folding tables to a brand-new,  25,000- square-foot facility on another floor.  Whether the trades remain under the aegis of the DWR is another matter.  Hannigan said he doesn't want his department to remain in the energy business  for years to come. Given his choice, he said he would prefer power purchases  being made by a newly created state energy authority, as proposed by  legislation now on the drawing board.  While some at the DWR appear to enjoy the department's newfound notoriety,  Hannigan, 60, is not one of them.  He said he is looking forward to retirement and spending more time with his  family. Being at the center of California's energy storm is clearly a  headache he'd rather not have at this point in his career.  \"I know we're outgunned,\" he said. \"I just don't know how badly.\"  The Power Cycle  1. Electricity Providers  Power companies stretching from Canada to Texas offer electricity to  shortage-plagued California. They have been accused of gouging consumers by  charging sky-high wholesale rates.  2. Department of Water Resources  Department of Water Resources state bureaucrats are spending $350 million a  week purchasing electricity on behalf of utilities. One energy trader said  the DWR willingly agrees to pay \"prices that make you wonder.\"  3. Troubled Utilities  PG&E and Edison say they do not have enough money to purchase power for  customers. So they let the DWR do the buying and then PG&E and Edison pass  along the electricity -- and costs -- to millions of consumers.  4. The Consumers  California's energy woes ultimately will be born by consumers, either in the  form of higher rates or higher taxes. Consumers will be accountable for all  money that goes to buy electricity.

Gray Davis to remedy California's energy mess by purchasing  the utilities' power lines.  The talks are still slogging through a pea soup of issues and legal details.  Pacific Gas and Electric Co. is reluctant to sell its transmission lines, and  to part with them at all the company wants considerably more than the $5  billion the state is believed to be offering.  While the creditors are going after Southern California Edison, which owes  millions of dollars to smaller power companies, analysts said similar  bankruptcy proceedings against PG&E could follow at any time.  The heightened potential for one or both of California's two biggest  utilities going bankrupt sent a chill through investors. Shares of PG&E Corp.  fell almost 12 percent yesterday to $11.42, while Edison International  dropped 10 percent to $12.24.  Moving quickly to stem Wall Street's jitters, PG&E's chief financial officer,  Kent Harvey, said in a conference call that the utility will pay off a  portion of its debts to power companies and intends to make good to all  creditors.  \"The message they're trying to send is that they're in a better position than  Edison,\" said Paul Patterson, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. \"They  wanted to make clear that no one is threatening them with bankruptcy.\"  Not yet. For the moment, all eyes are on Edison.  Coram Energy Group, an alternative energy provider that supplies electricity  to the Southern California utility, said it is owed as much as $350,000 for  past transactions.  Frustrated by the slow pace of Davis' efforts to resolve the situation, Coram  said it will initiate a petition to force Edison into bankruptcy. The company  would need the cooperation of only two other generators to bring the matter  to a bankruptcy judge.  \"It will be fairly easy for Coram to collect the two other signatures,\"  Patterson said.  Kevin Kelley, an Edison spokesman, declined to comment on the creditors'  move. \"We're doing everything we can to avoid bankruptcy,\" he said.  DISCONTENT AMONG SMALL FIRMS Growing discontent among smaller power companies, known in the industry as  \"qualifying facilities,\" represents a new challenge for the governor, who has  been struggling to keep the firms in line as he deals with PG&E and Edison.  \"We're on the phone all the time with these guys,\" said Steve Maviglio, a  spokesman for Davis. \"We've been trying to work something out.\"  If more creditors cut loose and seek redress in bankruptcy court, any state  bailout of the utilities, which are saddled with more than $13 billion in  debt,  could quickly unravel.  A bankruptcy court, for example, could block the sale of transmission lines  and order higher rates for consumers.  SOME PLANTS SHUT DOWN At the same time, analysts said the creditors -- some of which have had to  shut down plants due to unpaid bills -- may view bankruptcy proceedings as  the only way to recoup even a portion of past expenses before they too face  financial ruin.  \"Involuntary bankruptcy is something done by people who are fed up and want  to send a message,\" said Wesley Avery, a Los Angeles bankruptcy lawyer.  However, he noted that several obstacles still would have to be overcome to  force either Edison or PG&E into bankruptcy. First, a bankruptcy court would  have to decide whether to even accept the creditors' petition.  If it does, the judge subsequently could rule that the creditors' losses are  not significant enough to merit forcing an entire utility into bankruptcy.  The judge also could postpone acting on the matter until the governor has had  a chance to complete his negotiations with the utilities and seek an  alternative remedy.  On the other hand, Avery noted that Edison and PG&E already meet one of the  key criteria for involuntary bankruptcy: \"They are regularly missing  payments.\"  A company forced into bankruptcy has less control over its fate than one that  voluntarily seeks Chapter 11 protection. Avery thus said the likely strategy  for both Edison and PG&E would be to wait until an involuntary bankruptcy  looks imminent and then to quickly file voluntary papers.  BANKRUPTCY LAWYERS RETAINED PG&E retained bankruptcy lawyers from the New York firm of Weil, Gotshal &  Manges last August. Sources within the utility said bankruptcy papers already  have been drawn up and are ready to be filed at a moment's notice.  The governor has had to face such pressure in negotiating to purchase PG&E's  power lines and coastal property. Sources familiar with the talks said the  utility keeps sending mixed signals on its commitment to actually cutting a  deal.  For example, the sources said PG&E's chairman, Robert Glynn, will agree to  various terms offered by Davis. But the next day, they said, a team of PG&E  lawyers will backpedal from the accord.  Update  -- Pressure: Small power companies initiated moves that could force  California's two biggest utilities into bankruptcy.  -- At stake: Gov. Gray Davis tried to prevent small creditors from pursuing  bankruptcy proceedings that could undermine his plan to bail out  cash-strapped utilities.  -- Worries: Shares of PG&E Corp. and Edison International dropped sharply on  fears of bankruptcy.  -- Scramble: PG&E, hoping to reassure investors, says it will pay off part of  the utility's debt.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered six energy suppliers to  explain their pricing by Friday. If the commission doesn't accept the  explanations, it could order the firms to refund the money.  The order marked the third time in a week that the commission accused  generators of overcharging or manipulating prices during California's energy  crisis.  Last Friday, it ordered 13 suppliers to justify their prices or refund as  much as $69 million for sales in January. On Wednesday, the commission  demanded to know why two generators withheld power from two of their  so-called must-run plants last spring, forcing power grid operators to buy  electricity at higher rates from other plants operated by the companies.  Critics of the commission said the potential refund described in yesterday's  order is too small, particularly when the state paid more than $1. 5 billion  to buy electricity in February.  \"The significance is how insignificant the proposed refund is,\" said Michael  Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumer Action Network in San  Diego.  \"(The commission) is doing less than something,\" Shames said. \"The proposed  order creates a sham that FERC is providing some kind of discipline on this  out-of-control market, when in fact it's not.\"  Two companies, Dynegy and Williams Energy, accounted for a combined $45  million of the possible $55 million in overcharges cited by the commission  yesterday.  They also represent more than 10,105 of the 11,204 transactions that the  regulators said may have been overpriced.  Other companies named were Duke Energy, Portland General Electric Company,  Reliant and Mirant.  Power suppliers have steadfastly denied price gouging, saying that short  supply and the weak financial condition of the state's two largest utilities  led to increased prices.  State politicians have repeatedly said that part of California's power woes  are caused by generators taking advantage of the state's plight.  Yesterday the same politicians complained that the way the regulatory  commission calculates possible overcharging is too generous to the  generators.  The commission's methodology is based on several variables, such as the price  of natural gas. It also counts sales only during Stage 3 power alerts, when  electricity reserves are extremely low.  In its January ruling, the regulators set a baseline price of $273 a megawatt  hour and questioned deals in which energy companies charged more than that.  Changes in gas and other prices pushed that figure to $430 a megawatt hour in  February.  \"Before the energy crisis started in California, electricity was selling at  an average wholesale cost of $30 a megawatt hour. And now, FERC is saying a  baseline of $430 a megawatt hour is a reasonable cost,\" said Sen. Dianne  Feinstein, D-California. \"Something is really wrong here.\"  Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for the Texas company Reliant Energy, said that  given the billions of dollars in power sales to California, the relatively  low amount of alleged overpricing suggests a small problem.  \"What this tells me and others is that the FERC found the majority of those  transactions to be appropriate,\" Wheatley said.

On the other hand, a lot of PG&E's customers who have been in danger of  having the lights go out are suddenly exempt -- thanks to the utility's  refiguring of who belongs in blackout-free zones.  The net effect is to decrease, by about 120,000 customers, the number of  people who would be victimized by rolling blackouts that even the Bush  administration said this week are a virtual certainty during summer in  California.  Pacific Gas and Electric Co. said yesterday that about 810,000 of the 1.9  million customers who used to be exempt from rolling blackouts are losing  their coveted spot in \"Block 50\" -- a collection of neighborhoods immune from  the shut-offs because they share a power circuit with a hospital, police  station or other customer deemed to be essential.  Those public services are kept running during electricity shortages -- and so  are homes served by the same wires.  PG&E bumped the customers off the lucky list to reflect changes in  distribution lines. In all, 360 circuits no longer power essential services.  But about 690,000 other households will receive news that they have been  added to Block 50, perhaps because a fire station or other public safety  building has been built in the area, said PG&E spokesman Jon Tremayne.  PG&E said it started reviewing who was in Block 50 to get ready for the  likely summer blackouts. However, the changes will do little to reduce the  overall percentage of customers spared from rolling blackouts.  In two days of blackouts in Northern and Central California in January, 43  percent of customers were on Block 50 and had nothing to worry about. The  latest change drops that to 42 percent.  By looking at the block number on their bills, customers can tell whether  they will have to take their turn sitting in the dark for as long as two  hours during power shortages as the utilities reduce the demand for  electricity through staged shut-offs.  For safety's sake, Tremayne said, PG&E doesn't release the locations of  blocks that could suddenly be plunged into the dark. \"The bad guys in this  world can go there and do bad things,\" he said.  Like an instant lottery winner, Helen Hearne, 79, of Berkeley found out she  is one of the thousands of new Block 50 customers when she scanned her new  bill yesterday. She has no idea why, but she is not asking any questions.  \"I'm relieved,\" Hearne said. \"Everything we have is electric.\"  Bill Giacometti of Oakland's Montclair neighborhood, who was jubilant when he  learned in January he was exempt from the blackouts, faced the possibility of  being banished from Block 50. But the bill that arrived yesterday brought  good news -- he is still in, thanks to the fire station up the street.  \"I'm elated, of course,\" Giacometti said. \"I would say I don't need as  extensive an emergency plan.\"  But he said he is mainly relieved that he won't have to reset the clocks on  VCRs and other appliances.  \"You have to run around putting everything back to normal -- and then nobody  remembers how to do it,\" Giacometti said.  PG&E divides blackout-eligible customers into 14 blocks in Northern and  Central California. To spread the inconvenience equally, every one of the  blocks takes its turn.  Residents in part of Block 9 are next in line to suffer through a power loss.  Blocks 1 through 8, as well as half of Block 9, were shut off either during  the blackouts in January or during a rolling blackout last June.  Each block contains about 200,000 customers.  The possibility of power shortages still looms as Gov. Gray Davis tries to  line up reliable supplies of electricity under long-term contracts.  Davis also is hoping to get Californians to conserve at least 10 percent of  energy usage as the weather heats up and air conditioners click on, and he is  hoping to get enough power plants online to add 5,000 megawatts to the grid.  Each megawatt can supply power for 1,000 homes.

Now it looks like they're determined to inflict their special brand of  customer service on people who actually pay their bills.  That's how Ken Zankel and his employees ended up in the dark on Tuesday, not  a good spot for people involved in the restaurant business, who rely on  things like electricity, customers and tips. And it's not so good for the  food either, unless you happen to like your quesadillas baked in the sun.  Zankel is the sole owner and proprietor of two well-received and popular  eating establishments in the Marina district -- one called Alameda whipsnake,  and the other called the Grove. They have been around for seven and six  years, respectively, which means they are well beyond the restaurant failure  curve, a ranking generally accorded to places that offer good food and  service and have a proven track record of paying their bills.  But a lot has changed in the continually more costly restaurant business  since PG&E decided to make a rather public showing of its corporate  shortsightedness and power rates went through the roof. And it certainly  wasn't made any easier when the utility giants begun charging countless  numbers of customers for back payments resulting from PG&E's own failure to  properly monitor monthly billing.  Zankel discovered this in January, when, in spite of his squeaky clean record  of on-time payments, he was hit with a $6,000 increase for power use at the  Grove, an upgrade that did not elude his bookkeeper. The corporate titans at  PG&E might not notice when the zeros light up, but when Zankel found his bill  jumping from $1,200 to $7,200 in 30 days, it registered on the meter.  His bookkeeper inquired. Officials at the utility company's so-called  customer service center checked deeper and said that new software installed  by PG&E the previous summer had under-billed numerous customers for the  previous six months and that the January invoice was correct.  But because PG&E had made the mistake, thanks to its Hal-like computer, it  would happily work out a payment plan for Zankel that could accommodate the  restaurant owner and the accounting-challenged power provider.  The deal was that Zankel would pay $1,000 extra on his monthly utility bill  for the next six months without interest, PG&E being ever so gracious,  because,  the customer rep said, it was indeed their mistake.  And what good is a utility without public outreach?  So Zankel paid, three extra zeros for the first two months, when he received  another loving note from PG&E on Feb. 21 that if he did not pay his bill in  the next 48 hours, his power would be shut off.  A frightened Zankel checked in with the friendly customer service center to  discover that, in fact, another mistake had been made. \"There should be no  worries,\" his service representative assured him, especially since they were  able to track down his Feb. 9 check for $2,176. He was told his next payment  was due on March 15. And thanks so much for calling.  Then, about 9 a.m. Tuesday, PG&E sent a service technician out to Zankel's  Chestnut Street location and cut off his power.  Zankel's manager called him at home, where he reacted with the cool of a  roasted jalapeno pepper. \"It's always great for business when your customers  are sitting in the dark, your staff can't work and there's nothing you can do  about it,\" he said.  So he called PG&E's customer service center, where he was told by a nice  young woman that they couldn't find any problems for why his electricity was  shut down. \"This shouldn't have happened,\" she told him, but it would  probably be a few hours before they could send someone out to restore his  power.  Zankel asked why he didn't get a notice saying the utility was contemplating  shutting off his service, and he was told the previous notice was all they  needed to provide.  \"You mean if you send out a notice that was mistaken, that's all the company  feels it needs to do?\" he asked. Yes, she replied, that was her understanding  of company policy.  He blurted out something about suing PG&E. Her response: \"If you're going to  sue us, then I can't help you anymore and you'll have to go through the PUC  to get your power turned back on.\"  No, no, no, he said. Let's just take care of this and get my power turned  back on.  Zankel raced down to the PG&E center on Mission Street and wrote a check for  the full remaining balance of his bill, $4,445.85, \"just so I wouldn't have  to deal with it anymore.\" Then the clerk informed him that there would be a  $20 turn-on charge. He fished a $20 bill out his pocket and handed it to her.  The receipt noted this transaction, and the check amount, with the parting  words: \"The easy way to pay PG&E.\"  \"There is no easy way to pay PG&E,\" Zankel said. \"I'm just lucky that we're  in good financial shape. Some restaurants might go under because of something  like this. Maybe PG&E would be better off financially if they learned to bill  people correctly.\"  But PG&E spokesman Jon Tremayne said that although he didn't know the  specifics of Zankel's case, it must have been a mistake.  \"The last thing we want to do is to shut power off for some business,\" he  said. \"We're very flexible in working with customers on a payment program. I  don't know what happened in this case, but it's our policy to go out of our  way to avoid things like this.\"  That's not going to happen anytime soon. Zankel's latest bill came in showing  a charge for $366.40, once again, at least $1,000 off the actual amount. That  darn software. You just never know when it's going to act up.  The company is once again threatening blackouts this summer. Chances are a  lot of people won't have to wait that long.

But it's provided a jolt of energy to  a hardy perennial of politics: parochialism.  Announcing yet another investigation into electricity prices, several state  senators condemned ``out-of-state generators.'' Their greed, said one, has  produced a ``massive transfer of wealth'' out of California.  Gov. Gray Davis in his state-of-the-state speech intoned: ``Never again can  we allow out-of-state profiteers to hold California hostage.''  In the hysterical high point of this line of argument, Sen. Steve Peace, D-El  Cajon, one of the architects of electricity restructuring, took to the Senate  floor to declare that unless California moved into public ownership of power  it might as well ``raise the Lone Star flag atop the Capitol.''  About the only thing right about this rant is the geography. The energy  companies are indeed out of state, with a group of them in Texas. Dynegy,  Reliant and Enron are based in Houston; Duke, in Charlotte; Mirant in  Atlanta; and Williams Energy, in Tulsa.  As for the rest of the argument, it appears to be based on a Fort Knox  concept of where money is: Profits sit in vaults, until spent to benefit the  state in which they repose.  I'm not denying there is reason to at least investigate the profits made by  generators of power. But some who have done well -- Calpine and the Los  Angeles Department of Water and Power, to name two -- are based in  California. What difference does location make? Victims of muggings do not  generally express relief if told the robbers were fellow Californians. ``Oh  good, the money will stay in the community,'' no one has ever told the  police.  First, let's establish the scale of this alleged transfer of wealth. The  obscene profit is often put at $15 billion. I'm no economist, but I think  this is somewhere between buckets of money and a boatload. Compared with the  $1 trillion California economy, however, it's 1.5 percent.  The transfer that matters doesn't cross political boundaries, but business  ones. It is from companies that consume electricity to make products or offer  services, to those that produce electricity. Rising energy prices inflate the  cost of most goods and services.  The second fallacy in the ``massive transfer of wealth'' is that the money  goes to some other state and stays there. Not in today's economy.  Duke Energy, for instance, is proposing to invest more than $1 billion to  modernize power plants at Moss Landing and Morro Bay.  Even if most of the money California spends on electricity goes to companies  out of state, why would that matter? Most of the money California spends on  cars goes to companies headquartered in Michigan, Germany and Japan. No  legislation or investigation is pending.  Profits made by companies in California or elsewhere go to shareholders, who  might live anywhere. Or they go into bank accounts, to be invested wherever  the bank thinks is profitable. Or they are used to expand the company, which  could happen in its home state or anywhere else it does business.  One of California's energy companies, Pacific Gas & Electric, has made  investments nationwide.  The reason I raise this issue, other than in a hopeless quest for precision  in political discourse, is that parochialism could cause the state to make  bad decisions about electricity.  Already legislators are muttering about prohibiting generators in California  from selling their electricity outside the state, unless California is  assured a sufficient supply. But there's much evidence that a Western  regional market would be more efficient than one in California alone.  And, looking at the flow the other way, California should not hesitate to  obtain power from companies based out of state if they offer the best prices.  There are reasons to locate the actual power plants close to the users; they  don't apply to the company headquarters.  The political boundaries that define the state of California are not likely  to be the logical physical or financial boundaries of the electricity market,  just as they are not the boundaries of the lettuce or microprocessor market.  California should protect itself from being gouged by generators no matter  where they are located. And if the generators are doing business fairly,  Californians should no more worry about where the money they spend on  electricity is going than they worry about where the money they spend on cell  phones is going.

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. natural gas physical prices mostly rose Monday, but held as much as a full $1 per million British thermal units below the New York Mercantile Exchange's December futures contract, traders said.  Pushing prices upward is a mix of next-month's futures values and the impatience of waiting for winter, traders said.  Traders covered short positions and balanced out pipeline overruns in usual end-of-month trading. Clouding the procedures were concerns about Enron Corp.'s viability and about terrorism attacks on pipelines, as Attorney General John Ashcroft confirmed warnings received by the FBI and other security agencies.  Traders don't expect the cash-to-futures spread to continue much longer, especially with the advent of winter weather and the expiration of the December contract on Wednesday.  However, major constrictions were reported over the weekend and Monday at major Gulf Coast to Northeast pipelines, meaning storage is full and there's little incentive to hedge.  \"People have no place to go (with the gas),\" said one trader.  In the West, prices strengthened as traders looked ahead to next-month values, one trader said.  \"There was absolutely no reason to be buying,\" said one Gulf Coast trader. He saw some weather forecasts predicting cooler temperatures, but those predictions were still above-normal weather patterns.  \"Winter will be here sometime,\" he said.  Traders also avoided doing physical gas deals with Enron Corp., whose merger with Dynegy Inc. appeared in danger. Enron faces employee lawsuits and a weakening of its bonds. The company is reportedly trying to renegotiate its deal with Dynegy. In the meantime, a trader said Enron's gas bids and offers were well above pricing seen on other boards.  December goes off the board Wednesday. It settled at $2.696 per million British thermal units, down 11.7 cents.  At the benchmark Henry Hub in south Louisiana, traders paid $1.72-$1.90/MMBtu, up 10 cents on the bid, down 39 cents on the offer. First-of-month November index is $3.16/MMBtu, traders said.  Deals at Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Station No. 65 were done in a $1.72-$1.88/MMBtu range, unchanged on the bid, down 22 cents on the offer from Wednesday's range. November first-of-month index is $3.19/MMBtu, a trader said.  At the Arizona-California Border, where gas from El Paso's pipeline begins delivery to Southern California lines, buyers paid $2.03-$2.50/MMBtu, up 55 cents-78 cents. November first-of-month index is $2.95/MMBtu.  At the Katy hub in East Texas, buyers paid $1.78-$2.05/MMBtu, up 11 cents-16 cents. November index is $3.01/MMBtu. Houston Ship Channel rose 13 cents-15 cents to $1.84-$2.09/MMBtu. Index is $3.12/MMBtu.  At Waha in West Texas, buyers paid $1.88-$2.20/MMBtu, up 33 cents-47 cents. November index is $2.86/MMBtu.  -By John Edmiston, Dow Jones Newswires; 713-547-9209; john.edmiston@dowjones.com     Citigroup Has $2.38B Less To Lose On Enron Due To Swaps By Christine Richard Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES  11/26/2001 Dow Jones Capital Markets Report (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Citigroup Inc. (C) is expected to extend a hand to Enron Corp. (ENE) by renegotiating a $690 million payment due Nov. 27.  But investors shouldn't be concerned that the financial services giant is too exposed to the embattled energy trading company. Citigroup already may have laid off the loan and other exposure via a series of credit default swap transactions. That means more institutional investors left holding the bag if Enron isn't ultimately rescued from financial collapse by a takeover proposed by Dynegy Inc. (DYN). Over the last few years, Citigroup has entered into at least six transactions that effectively would allow the bank to lay off the equivalent of $2.384 billion in Enron exposure.  Citigroup was instrumental in setting up Enron Credit Linked Notes Trust, Enron Credit Linked Notes Trust II and Yosemite Securities Trust I, which together raised $1.750 billion; Enron Sterling Credit Linked Notes Trust and Yosemite Securities Co., which raised a combined GBP325 million; and Enron Euro Credit Linked Notes Trust, which issued EUR200 million.  Citigroup, which acts as the default swap counterparty to the trusts, receives the return on the portfolio of single-A-plus-or-better-rated securities, purchased with the proceeds of the offerings, in exchange for providing the payout on the Enron exposure, according to Mary Ryan, director of synthetic securities ratings at Standard & Poor's.  As long as Enron remains out of bankruptcy, Citigroup continues to make payments on the notes, Ryan said.  If Enron defaults, Citigroup would cease making payments to the trust. The single-A-plus-or-higher-rated securities in the trusts would go to Citigroup in exchange for the same nominal amount of now in-default Enron debt obligations. And with speculation mounting that Dynegy will reduce, or maybe even scrap, its offer to buy Enron, the chances of a such a default-driven transfer would appear to be rising.  These notes essentially are synthetic Enron debts, meaning they act like Enron bonds in many respects, but lack key components that make holders true creditors of Enron.  For instance, the holders of these notes, because they don't possess actual Enron obligations - and won't unless the company defaults - are not involved in negotiations to restructure or rollover debt. It has been reported that Enron is engaged in active negotiations over the terms of its debts with creditors.  The synthetic notes all carry a rating equivalent to Enron's rating of triple-B-minus from Standard & Poor's and Baa3 from Moody's Investors Service.  The rating on the securities has been downgraded in recent weeks to reflect the downgrades in Enron's ratings.  Citigroup officials did not respond to requests for further details on the transactions. -By Christine Richard, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2189;  christine.richard@dowjones.com Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

STOCKWATCH Enron falls 14 pct on mounting concerns over Dynegy deal  11/26/2001 AFX News (c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd NEW YORK (AFX) - Shares of Enron Corp were down 14 pct in midsession trading as concerns continued to mount over the energy giant's acquisition by Dynegy Inc, with investors focusing more and more on the deal's breaking clause, dealers said.  At 12.45 pm, Enron shares were trading down 65 cents at 4.06 usd, a decline of 14.0 pct. Dynegy was down 1.60 usd at 38.80, amid broad declines in energy shares as crude prices sank. The DJIA was up 57.70 points at 9,892.86. The S&P 500 was up 6.24 points at 1,143.27. The Nasdaq composite was up 11.94 points at 1,886.99.  Dealers said that with Enron shares having slid well below the Dynegy offer price of 9.85 usd a share, the ChevronTexaco affiliate may well reconsider its offer, or walk away from the deal all together.  \"People are making the bet that perhaps Dynegy may cancel the deal, and that's there a lot more risk in playing the arbitrage,\" said Jefferies & Co market strategist Art Hogan.  The deal with Dynegy contains a \"material adverse change\" clause, which could be invoked to call the deal off, he said.  As part of its due diligence, Dynegy is examining details of Enron's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, which reportedly contained information it had not received previously.  Enron shares have plunged further since the filing, in which Enron revealed a number of new financial problems including a possible obligation to repay a 690 mln usd note due Nov 27.  Enron subsequently received an extension on the repayment until mid-December.  Since the beginning of the year, Enron shares have lost over 90 pct of their value after it was revealed that the company would post hefty third-quarter charges linked to risky investments by the firm's former chief financial officer.  \"At this point, with so much smoke around the fire, I think the shares are rightly valued,\" said Jefferies' Hogan.  ng/gc Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.    USA: UPDATE 1-Enron shares slide lower as merger doubts intensify. By Janet McGurty  11/26/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. NEW YORK, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Shares of troubled energy giant Enron Corp. continued to lose ground on Monday amid fears that the proposed acquisition of the company by smaller rival Dynegy Inc. will fall through.  Enron stock was down 61 cents, or 12.9 percent, at $4.13 in active midmorning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Dynegy has agreed to pay $10.55 per share for Enron. \"The market is acting like the deal is not going through or not going through at the original terms,\" said Michael Heim, an industry analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons.  Heim said that among three possible scenarios - the deal goes through as planned, it is canceled, or it is restructured - the first is the least likely.  \"Escape clauses\" built into the Dynegy-Enron deal give the buyer the option to back out if there is serious deterioration in Enron's business or assets.  \"Dynegy has a good claim that the 'material adverse condition' clause has already been triggered, either by the $690 million loan being accelerated, earnings (being) down or the ongoing trading business weakness,\" he said.  Last week Enron said it could be forced to pay a $690 million debt this week because of a credit downgrade, but the payment deadline has been delayed until mid-December.  Enron's recent admission that lower volumes at its trading business - the crown jewel that Dynegy most covets - could cause low fourth-quarter earnings raises the possibility that the trading business is losing its profitability. Continued lower volumes there would remove a key attraction for Dynegy.  \"Every day that goes by where Enron trading volumes become less, it decreases the value of the assets Dynegy was trying to buy in the first place,\" Heim said. \"Besides trading and marketing, what value does Enron have?\"  The majority of Enron's physical assets are spoken for, with partnerships and creditors getting first dibs and Dynegy getting the first right to exercise its option to acquire Enron's Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  Dynegy, which is 26.5 percent-owned by energy giant ChevronTexaco , is to swap 0.2685 share of its own stock for each share of Enron. Shares of Dynegy were down $1.27, or 3.1 percent, at $39.13 in midmorning NYSE trade.  Enron agreed to a Dynegy buyout after it was overwhelmed by a series of problems, including a U.S. regulatory probe of off-balance-sheet dealings by its officers, a $1.2 billion cut in shareholder equity, and cuts in its credit ratings.  Enron subsequently restated its earnings, but investor unease snowballed and its share began tumbling. The shares were above $90 in August 2000.  Heim said he was not sure that EnronOnline, Enron's online trading platform, is the premier property it once was.  \"Two years ago it had some value, but now others have been able to duplicate it. It's not the computer systems - it's the traders and network that Enron had. If those go away, the value lessens.  Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.    USA: Enron lawsuit seen as wake-up call for pensions.  11/26/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. HOUSTON, Nov 26 (Reuters) - A Washington, D.C., lawyer said Monday he hopes heavy losses suffered by Enron Corp. employees will spur Congress to limit employee investments in their employers' stock through 401 (k) retirement plans.  \"How many workers have to lose both their jobs and their retirement savings before Congress steps in and puts a stop to this by placing a cap on the amount of company stock that can be in a 401 (k) plan?\" lawyer Eli Gottesdiener asked. Gottesdiener released a statement Monday saying he had filed a lawsuit on behalf of employees of the beleaguered energy giant who have lost an estimated $850 million on Enron stock held in their 401 (k) retirement accounts.  The suit is the third one filed against Enron that alleges the company breached its fiduciary duty to employees by encouraging them to invest in its stock at artificially inflated prices. All three suits seek class-action status.  Enron's shares have fallen from a high of $90 in August 2000 to less than $5 today, their decline accelerating since Oct 16 amid a series of disclosures about its deteriorating finances.  Like many other companies, Enron makes matching contributions to its employees' 401 (k) retirement accounts in its own stock. It also requires them to hold the stock they receive in matching contributions until they turn 50.  Enron employees were also prevented from selling Enron stock held in retirement accounts for several weeks from mid-October due to a change in the retirement plan's administrator.  Gottesdiener said investment advisors recommend investing no more than 15 percent of a portfolio in a single stock, but that participants in 401 (k) plans offering employer stock as a choice typically hold 33 percent of their portfolio in that stock.  \"Congress sensibly placed a 10 percent limit on company stock in traditional defined benefit plans back in 1974, but at the behest of the corporate lobby, it placed no such cap on defined contribution plans,\" he said.  The absence of such a cap in defined-contribution 401 (k) plans was \"completely indefensible,\" he said.  Gottesdiener's suit alleges that Enron violated federal securities law by offering and selling Enron stock to employees without issuing a prospectus. If proven, this would give workers the right to reverse their purchases, he said.  Gottesdiener is also involved in class action pensions litigation against New York Life Insurance Co. and SBC Communications Inc.. Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.    USA: US Corp Bonds-Bonds tighten, analysts fret on Enron.  11/26/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001. By Jonathan Stempel  NEW YORK, Nov 26 (Reuters) - U.S. corporate bonds outperformed Treasuries on Monday as traders edged back to their desks  following the Thanksgiving Day weekend, in the midst of a broad  revival for corporate bonds of all stripes.  In secondary trading, spreads, the yield difference between  the bonds and comparable maturity U.S. Treasuries, tightened about  0.01 percentage point.  \"I would expect a continuation of the tightening, especially  with Treasury interest rates going up,\" said one trader. \"Absolute  corporate yields are starting to look pretty attractive.\"  Corporate bonds, especially junk bonds, have outperformed  Treasuries this month as investors developed a new tolerance for  risk. Though absolute returns for investment-grade corporate bonds  are negative, they are even worse in the Treasury market, where  investors appear more convinced that the current U.S. economic  downturn won't be deep or long.  \"The successes in Afghanistan and some milder-than-anticipated  economic data have combined to increase investor appetite for  risk,\" wrote fixed-income research service CreditSights Inc. in a  report dated Monday. \"While the severity and swiftness of the bond  market's correction was a surprise, it hasn't changed our basic  view of U.S. corporate bonds and we continue to recommend  overweight positions.\"  This week's forward calendar remains quiet.  In early trading, 10-year Treasuries rose 10/32, as their  yields fell to 4.971 percent.  ENRON  Market participants are closely watching Houston-based Enron  Corp. as the largest U.S. energy trader tries to merge  with smaller cross-town rival Dynegy Inc. , keep its  investment-grade credit ratings, and manage a load of $9.15  billion of debt and other obligations, much of which is unsecured  and coming due within 13 months.  Of this debt amount, $690 million could come due by  mid-December, and $3.9 billion immediately if Enron falls to junk  status. The key to resolution of this matter, some observers  believe, is Enron's banks.  \"The goal of the banks now is to re-cut their exposure to gain  as much structural seniority or asset liens as possible, take out  fees, raise rates, take down total exposure, and generally improve  their risk-profile under multiple scenarios,\" said CreditSights.  \"The very bankers who are supplying liquidity through new  secured bank lines and who are rumored to be considering equity  investments are the ones on the hook (and unsecured) for $3  billion in bank loans,\" wrote Carol Levenson, an analyst for  GimmeCredit, another fixed-income research service. \"If Dynegy  backs out (in the interest of self-preservation), these vital bank  renegotiations might save Enron but leave unsecured bondholders as  the patsies.\"  Enron's existing 6.4 percent notes maturing in 2006 and 6.75  percent notes maturing in 2009 were bid on Friday at 57 cents on  the dollar, down from around par on October 12, before Enron first  reported third quarter results, which it later revised downward.  Enron shares have fallen 94 percent this year to their lowest  level since early 1989.  DATA  Investment-grade and junk bond spreads narrowed 0.1 and 0.27  percentage point last week, respectively, to 1.68 and 7.84  percentage points, according to Merrill Lynch & Co. Junk bond  spreads have narrowed 1.45 percentage points this month.  For the month, junk bonds have returned 2.996 percent, while  investment-grade corporate bonds have lost 2.355 percent and  Treasuries 3.488 percent, Merrill Lynch said. For the year, the  respective bonds are up 4.777, 9.634 and 6.565 percent.  For a complete list of upcoming or recently priced bond deals,  please click on .

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES (This story was published originally Friday)   NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Here's one 2001 outlook that couldn't have been more wrong. Around this time last year, pundits and fund managers were touting \"the perfect storm\" of market forces that were coming together to make the energy trading business one to watch in 2001.  Then came the California power crisis, and allegations of price-gouging and fears of credit defaults began to cloud the outlook for the group. That was followed by renewed volatility in power prices, and this time the prices were headed down, not up.  And then came a crushing blow against trading firms - the unraveling of the industry's largest player, Enron Corp. (ENE).  Simply put, the perfect storm stalled, and a business once buoyed by high gas prices, strong demand and tight supply now lies in tatters.  The stocks of companies whom some say should be valued more like growth stocks than utilities are instead mired at around nine-times earnings - about where traditional utilities trade.  And the chance for recovery in 2002?  Basu Mullick, portfolio manager of the Neuberger Berman Partners fund, is willing to bet there is. He thinks energy traders deserve at least the same price-to-earnings multiple as the broader market's median, which is currently between 16- to 17-times future earnings, he said. It's just a matter of time before the stocks get there.  \"They were just recovering from Gray Davis,\" Mullick said, referring to the governor of California, who had accused \"out-of-state\" energy traders of artificially inflating the price of power in the state, and triggering the state's energy crisis. \"Now, they are recovering from Enron.\"  The fund manager also blames lower commodity prices, warm weather and poor demand for the recent weak performance in the group.  \"Energy convergence companies are putting up terrific growth rates,\" he said. \"I don't think they should get the same valuation as a garden-variety utility.\"  Still, others think the stock market is continuing to make distinctions between the energy traders by taking a harder look at the companies' strategies and financial disclosures.  Enron's precarious financial situation underscores the importance of accounting issues. Although many of Enron's financial problems aren't solely the fault of mark-to-market accounting issues, there has been growing attention paid to this form of financial reporting because of the earnings volatility it can create.  Answers Elude Investors   Investors are asking hard questions, and not always getting the answers they want.  Using mark-to-market methods, a company calculates the fair market value of a commodity position - whether it's a contract, an option, a swap, etc. - at the time, even if the value of the position is realized over a longer period. The problem with this method is the actual cash a company realizes from the position might not be the same value the company calculated in its original assessment. Also, sometimes it isn't easy to calculate the fair value of the commodity position. This is particularly true in instances where the market for the commodity isn't liquid.  Over time, companies with the highest level of disclosure regarding their mark-to-market gains will most likely trade at higher multiples to counterparts that provide little or no disclosure, said ABN AMRO Inc. analyst Paul Patterson.  Encouragingly, it appears companies may already be responding to the call for added disclosure. According to a survey Patterson conducted, more companies with energy trading units were willing to disclose the details of their mark-to-market accounting practices during third-quarter conference calls compared with those in the second quarter.  Patterson said he prefers earnings that are cash-based.  \"All things being equal, we believe reported earnings that more closely reflect the timely realization of cash have a higher quality associated with them than earnings that do not,\" he said.  He expects investors to become smarter and learn to distinguish between earnings growth through accrual accounting and growth fueled by mark-to-market accounting.  At the end of the day, it is not a matter of simply producing profits, but being able to say where those earnings came from, said one investor, who manages a pension fund.  Some investors also may be placing a greater emphasis on the cash flow the energy merchants produce.  Tim O'Brien, portfolio manager of the Gabelli Utilities Fund, said energy merchants that own the physical power assets to back up their trading positions should trade at a premium to an independent power producers and traditional utility companies. Still, the stocks should be valued at less than the growth rate of the company because of their heavy exposures to commodity prices.  Energy merchants include companies such as Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) and Dominion Resources Inc. (D).  According to O'Brien, the group never deserved to have the price-to-earnings multiples above 20- to 30-times earnings, which were once paid for the stocks.  \"We all got sucked up by the up-leg of the cycle and forgot just how cyclical these companies are,\" O'Brien said, adding that the average multiple should be in the high single-digits to the high-teens.  As for independent power producers - which are companies without regulated operations that own power plants to generate electricity to sell and trade in the wholesale market - the group may wind up being valued on the basis of the replacement costs of the assets in their portfolio, according to O'Brien.  \"One analogy is that they are basically like commercial real-estate plays,\" O'Brien said.  That could mean stocks such as Calpine Corp. (CPN), which is already in the lower-half of its trading range, may have further to fall.  -By Christina Cheddar, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5166; christina.cheddar@dowjones.com Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

(Recasts with denial, comments from financial institution in paragraphs 5-6)  BOMBAY, Nov 26 (Reuters) - The Aditya Vikram Birla Group, a leading Indian conglomerate, on Monday denied newspaper reports it was looking to buy U.S. energy giant Enron Corp's 65-percent stake in the beleaguered Dabhol Power Company. \"There has been no expression of interest in Dabhol. We are not interested,\" a top AV Birla group official told Reuters.  Two leading Indian business dailies earlier said the group, whose interests range from textiles to cement and carbon black, is eyeing Dabhol to expand its interests in the domestic power sector.  The Economic Times and the Financial Express said the group was exploring the possibility of submitting an expression of interest to Indian financial institutions to buy Enron's stake in the company.  An official of state-run Industrial Development Bank of India, the leading financier of the $2.9 billion project in the western state of Maharashtra, said he has not heard from the Birla group.  \"We have not received any official communication from them,\" the official, who did not wish to be identified, told Reuters.  The spokesman for Dabhol was not available for comment.  FIGHTING FOR SURVIVAL  Enron Corp, which is fighting for survival in the United States amidst investor doubts over its corporate governance practices, owns 65 percent of Dabhol. General Electric Co and Bechtel own 10 percent each, while the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) owns 15 percent.  Dabhol and MSEB have been fighting over payment defaults and high tariffs for over a year. The dispute has affected India's efforts to attract foreign investment in the power sector and caused Enron and its U.S. partners to announce plans to exit the project.  Tata Power Company Ltd, India's largest private sector utility firm, and BSES Ltd, another utility company and a member of India's largest conglomerate, the Reliance Group, are already in talks to buy Enron's stake.  The AV Birla Group has adopted the route of mergers and acquisitions in recent years to consolidate its position in key industries.  Last week, one of its group companies, Grasim Industries Ltd, bought a 10-percent stake in India's largest cement maker, Larsen & Toubro Ltd  Earlier this year, Indian Rayon & Industries Ltd, another group company, entered the information technology sector by buying out France's Groupe Bull SA's 50.35 percent stake in PSI Data Systems  But the group's track record in the power sector has been less than impressive.  Two joint ventures with Britain's Powergen Plc to produce over 1,000 megawatts of electricity in two Indian states have not made much headway since they were announced in the mid-1990s.

Enron's Stock, Bonds Drop on Concern for Dynegy Bid (Update8) 2001-11-26 16:45 (New York)  Enron's Stock, Bonds Drop on Concern for Dynegy Bid (Update8)       (Adds analyst comment in 4th paragraph.)       New York, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s stock price declined to a 14-year low and its bonds plunged 10 points on concern the company won't secure $1 billion in fresh capital, threatening its plan to be acquired by Dynegy Inc.       ``The clock is definitely ticking,'' said Jon Kyle Cartwright, a debt analyst at Raymond James and Associates. ``The question is the survivability of Enron.''       J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. executives met today to line up investors for as much as $2 billion of bonds convertible into stock. The company needs the money to operate until Dynegy completes its $23 billion purchase. Dynegy unveiled its plan to make the acquisition on Nov. 9.       Enron shares and bonds, which opened lower, tumbled after 1 p.m. when no announcement for fresh financing was made. Enron's 6.4 percent notes that mature in 2006 plunged to 48 cents on the dollar, down from 55 cents on Friday. The bonds now yield 26 percent. Enron shares declined 15 percent, or 70 cents, to $4.01.       Concern that rival Dynegy may change or cancel its bid for Enron has pushed Enron's stock down 55 percent in the past week. Enron's shares had plummeted 86 percent since mid-October after the company reported a $618 million third-quarter loss and said expansion into water, telecommunications and retail-energy sales cost it $1.01 billion.       ``You haven't heard anything from Dynegy today, and that is a bit scary,'' said Andy Palmer, who doesn't hold Enron bonds in the $2 billion he helps manage at ASB Capital Management Inc. in Washington.       Part of the third-quarter charge was connected with limited partnerships run by the chief financial officer. He was ousted, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission started an investigation into Enron's accounting. The company earlier this month restated its earnings for the past four years.                          Talks on $1 Billion       Under the buyout, Enron investors would receive 0.2685 Dynegy share for each share held. That valued Enron at $10.41 a share, 21 percent more than Enron's share price that day.       On Friday, the buyout valued Enron at $10.85 a share, more than double Enron's closing price of $4.71. The widening of the difference between the value of the offer and Enron's stock price indicates investors doubt the buyout will go through.       Shares of Enron traded as low as $3.76 today, rebounding to close at $4.01. The stock was the most active in U.S. trading Wednesday and Friday. Dynegy dropped $1.15, or 2.85 percent, to $39.25. The stock has fallen 30 percent this year. Both companies are based in Houston.       Egan-Jones Ratings Co. lowered its rating on Enron's credit today to ``BB-'' from ``BB.'' ``Dynegy needs to show its support, or Enron will slide,'' the firm said in a report.       Moody's Investors Service hasn't issued a report on Enron since the company filed its 10-Q quarterly report with the SEC a week ago. The ratings agency's analysts haven't returned calls for comment.       Moody's cut Enron's long-term credit rating on Nov. 9, though it maintained an investment grade.                            `More Problems'       ``Time is not Enron's friend,'' said Stewart Morel, co-head of investment grade debt research at UBS Warburg LLC. ``There is increased concern in the market that there may be more problems that are yet to be disclosed.''       On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on a $690 million note due this week, giving the company more time to restructure its finances. Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watson said he was ``encouraged'' by the commitment to extend the note payment, as well as the closing of a $450 million credit facility, and that Dynegy remained committed to the merger.       Terms of the $690 million note were outlined for the first time in the Enron filing a week ago. Enron also said that it has less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines left. If the company's cash reserves run too low, Enron's credit rating may be cut below investment grade. That would trigger $3.9 billion in debt repayments for two affiliated partnerships.       Enron said in the filing that fourth-quarter profit might be hurt by a drop in its trading business. Companies such as Aquila Inc. and Mirant Corp. have reduced their activity with Enron because of credit concerns.       ``Should the Dynegy deal fall through, we don't view it likely that Enron would be able to remain as a stand-alone company,'' Youngberg of Edward Jones said. ``Without Dynegy, the credit rating will fall, causing their trading business to dry up further.''       Enron, the biggest energy trader, once handled about a quarter of U.S. gas and power transactions.       Enron's bankers met with leveraged buyout firms and two industrial companies to seek an investment, the New York Times reported last week. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. agreed to terms that give each of them a $250 million equity stake as part of a transaction to be completed today.    Dynegy Bonds Slip as Enron Purchase May Harm Credit Rating 2001-11-26 15:16 (New York)  Dynegy Bonds Slip as Enron Purchase May Harm Credit Rating       New York, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Dynegy Inc. bonds have fallen as much as 9 percent this month on investor concern the energy trader's proposed $23 billion purchase of rival Enron Corp. will erode its credit rating.       Dynegy's 6.88 percent coupon notes due in 2011 are trading at $932 per $1,000 face value, down from $1,024 last month, according to Merrill Lynch & Co. data. Yield on the debt has risen to 7.9 percent from 6.5 percent as investors demand more return to compensate for the increased risks of the securities.       Dynegy's credit is rated ``Baa3'' at Moody's Investors Service, the lowest rung of investment grade, and ``BBB+'' at Standard & Poor's, two levels higher. Each ratings company said it may cut Dynegy's credit rating if it buys Enron, which comes with about $15 billion in debt and a regulatory inquiry into financial partnerships set up to keep debt off its books.       ``If you put Dynegy and Enron together it will have a detrimental effect on Dynegy's credit rating,'' said Tim Nelson, senior credit analyst at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray Cos. in Minneapolis, which holds Dynegy bonds.       Dynegy's 7.45 percent coupon notes due in 2006 are trading at $1,019 per $1,000 face value, down from $1,085 last month, according to Merrill. The notes yield almost 7 percent, up from 5.4 percent.       Enron's credit is rated ``Baa3'' at Moody's and ``BBB-'' at S&P, the lowest level of investment grade. Both ratings companies are reviewing the credit for a possible downgrade and say Dynegy's buyout plan is what's keeping the grades above junk.       ``I don't think right now anybody knows exactly what Enron is,'' said Mark Simenstad, who holds Dynegy bonds in the $5 billion he helps manage at Lutheran Brotherhood.       ``Dynegy has proven to be pretty well-managed over the years so you have to give them the benefit of the doubt here,'' Simenstad said. ``The hope is that if there's something they don't understand they'll walk away.''       Dynegy has $3.9 billion of bonds outstanding, most of which come due between 2002 and 2011, according to Bloomberg data.       Shares of Houston-based Dynegy, which topped $47 two weeks ago after Chief Executive Chuck Watson said the Enron purchase would boost earnings by at least 35 percent next year, fell $1.30 to $39.10 in mid-afternoon trading today. Enron's shares, down 92 percent this year, fell as much as 80 cents, or 17 percent, to $3.91, a the lowest since 1987.    Enron Shares Slides to All-Time Low  By CBS.MarketWatch.com  4:53 PM ET Nov 26, 2001  HOUSTON (CBS.MW) -- Enron shares fell as much as 20 percent Monday, crashing through the $4 level for part to set an all-time low and cast additional doubt on the energy merchant's plan to be acquired by rival Dynegy.  Enron (ENE) set a new all-time low of $3.76 Monday afternoon before closing at $4.01, off 70 cents. More than 60 million shares changed hands, making it the most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange.  The stock has lost about half its value since Dynegy announced an agreement to buy Enron on Nov. 9 and more than 85 percent of its value in the past month.  Meanwhile, shares of Dynegy (DYN) lost $1.15, or 2.8 percent, to stand at $39.25.  The collapse in Enron's share price has made it more likely that Dynegy and Enron will have to renegotiate the terms of their original deal, in which 0.2685 of a Dynegy share would be exchanged for each outstanding Enron share.  However, the Financial Times reported that Dynegy remains confident of its ability to complete a deal for Enron, which has been seeking $500 million in private equity capital to shore up its finances.  \"We continue to hear reports the Enron's energy marketing and trading business, once the crown jewel of the company, has eroded badly with counterparties only willing to do shorter-term deals,\" A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons analysts Charles Fishman and Douglas Fischer wrote in a research note Friday.  Enron investors do not believe that the merger is likely to occur under the current terms, the analysts said.    Chance of Dynegy backing out  _______________________________________________________________________  On Monday, Michael Heim, also of A.G. Edwards, attributed Enron's latest stock drop to \"growing belief that the likelihood of the (merger) deal is not so likely.\"  He pointed out that the outlook for Enron is \"not very favorable\" but in the meantime, it's doing everything it can to stay \"afloat\" while working on closing the deal.   Last week, Enron said it got a bank extension on a $690 million note to mid-December. The note was originally set to come due in 2003, but was bumped up to Nov. 26 due to a rating downgrade at Standard &amp; Poor's. <http://cbs.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B81418CA4%2D11A5%2D4C7C%2DA602%2DCF3DA4BCAA7B%7D>  The payment by itself is manageable because Enron has about $2 billion in cash on its hands, Heim said, but \"the event moves Enron's merger one step closer to the point in which Dynegy is able to exercise the merger's material adverse condition clauses and back out of, or restructure, the merger deal.\"  Heim has a \"sell\" rating on the stock.    FBI warns energy companies of possible threat to gas pipelines by Osama bin Laden's network By H. JOSEF HEBERT  11/26/2001  Associated Press Newswires  Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.  WASHINGTON (AP) - The FBI has warned energy companies that Osama bin Laden may have approved plans to attack North American natural gas pipelines and facilities if he is captured or killed.  Natural gas producers and pipeline companies continued to be on a high state of alert, industry executives said Monday, although they declined to discuss the latest warning, which was sent in a memo to industry security officials last week.  In Bismarck, Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline officials put employees on notice that they need to implement security measures, spokeswoman Laura Lueder said.  The company, a subsidiary of MDU Resources, serves North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana and Wyoming.  \"The company always had security measures outlined for these kind of situations, but it did update the measures following the Sept. 11 attacks,\" Lueder said.  Attorney General John Ashcroft confirmed the FBI warning, though he expressed some doubt that attacks would be conditioned on bin Laden's capture or death.  \"It didn't take anything specific to trigger the attacks on the World Trade Center or the Pentagon,\" said Ashcroft when asked about the alert at a news conference. Even so, \"those are the kinds of reports which we take seriously.\"  The alert did not single out a specific target, but referred to natural gas supplies including the more than 260,000 miles of gas pipelines and hundreds of pumping stations and other facilities.  \"We have received uncorroborated information that Osama bin Laden may have approved plans to attack natural gas supplies in the United States,\" said the memo, according to several industry sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  \"Such an attack would allegedly take place in the event that either bin Laden or Taliban leader Mullah Omar are either captured or killed,\" the alert continued.  The FBI alert said the information came \"from a source of undetermined reliability\" and that \"no additional details on how such an attack would be carried out, or which facilities would be targeted\" could be learned.  Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the energy industries - including operators of nuclear power plants, refineries, pipelines and power grids - have scrambled to increase security on a belief that they could be singled out for another round of attacks.  One industry source characterized the FBI warning as similar to one issued earlier this month on potential attacks against West Coast bridges that prompted security alerts. In that case, no further evidence of potential terrorist activity emerged.  The alert was sent on Nov. 17 from FBI headquarters to agency field offices, which then forwarded the information to industry officials. The alert prompted the American Petroleum Institute, which is the lead industry group coordinating with the FBI and Energy Department on security matters, to issue a memo last Wednesday to oil and gas companies.  Energy industry executives were reluctant to discuss the latest alert, or their security measures, although several confirmed the memo and said additional precautions have been taken. Still, the potential for a terrorist attack has left some industry officials jittery.  \"We prefer to keep a low profile,\" said an official of one of the largest natural gas pipeline companies, agreeing to speak only on background so that the company would not publicly be singled out.  \"Our facilities are on high alert and they have been since Sept. 11,\" said Laurie Cramer, a spokeswoman for the Natural Gas Supply Association, which represents natural gas producers.  There are 263,000 miles of natural gas transmission lines crossing the country and another million miles of local distribution lines. Although most of the lines are buried, aerial surveillance of major pipelines has been increased and security tightened at pumping stations, industry officials said.  Access to facilities has been restricted as well, officials said. Also, some detailed information about location of pipelines and other energy infrastructure has been taken off some corporate and government Internet sites.  But the industry is in a quandary over how much information should be withheld about the location of pipelines, which often must be clearly marked to prevent someone from accidentally rupturing one when digging. The availability of maps also has helped to promote acceptance of pipelines in communities.  \"We want people to know where they are\" to prevent accidents, said Benjamin Cooper, executive director of the Association of Oil Pipe Lines. But he acknowledged the desire for public disclosure now is being tempered somewhat for security concerns.  \"The biggest danger to natural gas pipelines on an ongoing basis is (the line) being hit by a backhoe or heavy equipment,\" said Kelly Merritt, a spokesman for Columbia Gas Transmission Corp., one of the country's biggest pipeline companies.  While a rupture of a gas or oil pipeline could cause significant problems, industry experts emphasized that most lines are relatively isolated and even a major break in a line can normally be repaired fairly quickly.     Heads Urge Pipe Safety Passage.  11/26/2001  Natural Gas Week  P8  (c) 2001 Energy Intelligence Group. All rights reserved  WASHINGTON, D.C. - A letter to US Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta urged passage of an effective and responsible pipeline safety bill.  In the letter, released last week, pipeline leaders offered their assistance to the department and said, \"Our industries have joined together to address both regulatory and legislative pipeline safety issues in a unified fashion.\"  Signing the letter were 14 leaders of the oil and natural gas transmission and distribution pipeline industries and the leaders of the five key trade associations, which include the American Gas Association, American Petroleum Institute, Association of Oil Pipe Lines, American Public Gas Association and Interstate Natural Gas Association of America.  The letter came with the industry's unified position paper calling for regulatory and legislative action on pipeline safety. The industry is urging an adequately staffed and funded Office of Pipeline Safety and other measures to increase safety and enhance public confidence.    Enron and Dynegy Discuss Plan to Cut Price of Acquisition By Rebecca Smith and Robin Sidel  11/27/2001  The Wall Street Journal  Page A3  (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  Enron Corp., struggling to save its two-week-old deal to be acquired by Dynegy Inc., was in advanced discussions with Dynegy to cut the price of the all-stock transaction by more than 40% to about $5 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.  Beleaguered Enron also was in continuing negotiations to extend the maturity dates of some of its borrowings in order to stem a growing liquidity crisis, these people said. Enron has total debt of about $13 billion. Increasingly, analysts are worried that the giant energy-trading concern's relatively few hard assets are so encumbered by debt that they can't be used to support further borrowing.  Enron stock slid to its lowest level in over a decade at 4 p.m. yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, falling 70 cents to $4.01 a share. Over the past few months, about $60 billion of Enron's stock value has evaporated, a process that has accelerated since mid-October when the company announced a quarterly loss and a subsequent reduction in its equity base. Since then, revelations that company executives profited from partnerships used to move assets on and off Enron's books have spooked investors and triggered a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. Recently, the company has twice restated earnings for past periods amid indications that its vaunted energy trading business is showing some signs of stress.  The move to renegotiate the acquisition agreement, and particularly to slash the number of Dynegy shares that Enron holders would receive, only two weeks after the pact's signing is virtually unheard of in corporate transactions. While terms are sometimes altered due to unanticipated developments, that typically doesn't happen until a transaction is nearly completed.  Enron had hoped to finalize arrangements and make an announcement yesterday that would calm its anxious investors, but the situation remained fluid throughout the day. As of yesterday evening, the revised deal still hadn't been formalized.  The deal is critical for Enron. In recent weeks, credit-rating agencies have indicated they will refrain from further cuts to Enron's credit rating so long as a Dynegy purchase appears probable. But if that deal collapses, downgrades could occur that would put Enron below investment grade and in violation of credit agreements with counterparties. This in turn could deal a savage blow to Enron's commodity-trading business that is its lifeblood.  Negotiators for the two companies returned to their home bases of Houston yesterday after spending much of the holiday weekend meeting in suburban New York where they tried to agree on new provisions to the deal, which was announced Nov. 9. Both Dynegy and Enron declined to comment on the discussions.  One apparent sticking point in the talks was arriving at a new stock-exchange ratio. Under the current acquisition agreement, Dynegy would exchange 0.2685 share for each Enron share tendered. Based on yesterday's New York Stock Exchange closing price of $39.25 for Dynegy shares, down $1.15, Enron holders stand to receive $10.53 a share for their stock, or a total of about $9 billion.  People close to the discussions said the new ratio is expected to be less than 0.15 share of Dynegy stock for every share of Enron stock, which would value Enron at less than $6 a share, or about $5 billion.  Another contentious issue concerns the amount of additional capital Enron needs to shore up its finances. A week ago, the company disclosed it may have to post hundreds of millions of dollars or more to honor collateral calls before the end of the year. The problem for potential lenders is finding good assets to back these continued infusions of capital sought by Enron.  As part of the original merger agreement, Dynegy already has injected $1.5 billion into Enron, receiving in exchange preferred stock in its Northern Natural Gas Co. pipeline system that runs from the upper Midwest to Texas. Under the agreement, if the acquisition falls apart, Dynegy \"will have the right to acquire 100% of the equity in the Northern Natural Gas subsidiary,\" thus giving it \"the full value of its investment.\"  But that arrangement is raising questions on Wall Street about whether creditors are throwing good money after bad. Northern Natural Gas already is heavily encumbered with debts. In addition to $500 million in unsecured public debt and $1.5 billion put in by Dynegy and co-investor ChevronTexaco Inc., a bank consortium led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. recently put in an additional $450 million in cash backed by Northern's assets. The bank consortium also provided $550 million to Enron, against which assets of Enron's Transwestern Pipeline Co. unit were pledged. This system, a network between Texas and California, is the only other domestic gas-transportation system fully owned by Enron.  That brings total indebtedness to nearly $4 billion for two Enron pipeline systems that only generated transportation revenue of $77 million and $41 million, respectively, in the third quarter. Enron's entire natural-gas pipeline business, which includes two other partially owned systems, produced pretax earnings of $85 million for the third quarter, flat with the year-earlier period. Some observers said that if the Enron deal to be acquired by Dynegy falls apart, this could set the stage for a fight among the different classes of creditors for a priority claim on the pipeline assets.  ---  Jathon Sapsford contributed to this article.     Fair Shares? Why Company Stock Is a Burden for Many -- And Less So for a Few --- Workers Often Must Hold On To Stakes Held in 401(k)s; Top Brass Have Options --- Hedging for the `Upper Tier' By Ellen E. Schultz and Theo Francis  11/27/2001  The Wall Street Journal  Page A1  (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  In the 1990s, as the stock market climbed year after year, many corporations and their employees entered into a marriage of convenience: The company would dole out its own shares as compensation and benefits. Employees would have a steadily appreciating asset that encouraged loyalty and created an incentive to work hard for the company's success.  They're still doing it. Gillette Co., for example, \"believes it is important that employee interests be aligned with company interests,\" says spokesman Stephen K. Brayton, echoing the explanations of dozens of other companies that use their own stock for executive pay, incentive bonuses, or contributions to 401(k) retirement-savings accounts.  But as share prices have fallen over the past year and a half, it has become clear that not all stock handouts are created equal. Millions of rank-and-file workers at hundreds of companies have found themselves shackled to big chunks of company stock, while executives are able to exercise wide latitude in what they do with theirs. Because of the law capping tax-deductible executive compensation at $1 million a year, many companies top off their executive pay packages with stock options, as well as bonuses and other incentives that are typically paid in stock, much of it unencumbered.  Based on filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, hundreds of companies use their own stock in lieu of cash as their matching contributions to employees' retirement-savings accounts. And the majority of those restrict the ability of employees to sell the shares and move the proceeds into mutual funds and other alternatives offered through their 401(k)s. Benefits consultants Hewitt Associates found in a recent study that nearly half of 215 firms offering company stock in their 401(k) plans only contribute their own shares to employee accounts, and that 85% of those companies restrict sales of the stock.  Gillette doesn't let employees switch out of its stock contributions to their 401(k)s until age 50, according to government filings. At Coca-Cola Co., it's age 53. Procter & Gamble Co., Qwest Communications International Inc. and troubled Enron Corp. -- now facing lawsuits over employees' 401(k) losses -- are among the many others that impose similar restrictions. So far this year, Gillette employees have had to watch the company-contribution portion of their retirement savings shrink by millions of dollars as the share price has fallen 11%. Employees at Coca-Cola have endured a share-price decline this year of 18%. Procter & Gamble shares have been flat.  The companies point out that executives participate in the same 401(k) plans as other employees, subject to the same restrictions. Still, the bulk of company stock that executives own is usually held outside such restricted accounts.  At Qwest, with a share price down 69% so far this year, top executives and directors have sold a combined $172 million of Qwest shares so far this year, according to SEC data collected by Thomson Financial/Lancer Analytics. Qwest Chief Executive Joseph P. Nacchio alone has sold Qwest shares valued at $89 million.  Likewise, many companies offer supplemental savings plans for executives that don't force them to hold company stock. Some top executives at Coca-Cola can participate in a supplemental retirement-savings plan with a guaranteed annual return of 14%. Executives at Qwest are able to contribute as much as 100% of their salaries and bonuses to a supplemental plan in which they can allocate their own and company contributions as they like.  Executives also can protect themselves -- without selling their shares and triggering taxes -- by using hedging techniques offered for just that purpose by firms such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Eaton Vance Corp. and Bessemer Trust Co. Disclosure of these deals to the SEC is generally required but spotty.  \"It clearly has been a growing business, and very busy in the last 12 months,\" says Michael Dweck, head of the Single Stock Risk Management division at Goldman Sachs. (The firms marketing these hedging strategies typically hedge their own side of the transactions to protect themselves, as well.) \"People recognize the inherent risk of holding all your wealth in a single stock.\" His operation generally won't arrange transactions for blocks of stock worth less than $5 million. \"It's for the upper tier of management,\" Mr. Dweck says.  For the rest, companies point out, employees have ample opportunity to diversify their retirement-savings portfolios by investing their own contributions in other options offered. Indeed, many workers have ill-advisedly put a lot of their own 401(k) money into their employers' stock.  Wyn Triska, a 42-year-old power-plant technician for an Enron unit in Estacada, Ore., says he warned many of his co-workers of the dangers of wagering all their retirement savings on Enron. \"Even when Enron was going up,\" he says, \"I never put a cent into it -- it just doesn't make sense to load up on one stock.\" Nonetheless, even he has been unable to sell the stock that Enron has contributed to his 401(k) as the share price has plummeted from $86 a little more than a year ago to around $4 now. Under the company's 401(k) rules, he can't sell until age 50.  For many rank-and-file workers, risk-averse or not, their 401(k)s are their largest assets, apart from their homes. So holding company stock they can't sell has become a source of resentment and frustration. Federal pension law leaves 401(k) plans largely outside the realm of regulation. But lately, some employees have taken their frustration to the courts.  Just this month, in three separate lawsuits -- the latest filed yesterday -- participants in Enron's 401(k) plan allege that Enron misled them about the risks of investing in the company's shares. The suits, all filed in Federal District Court in Houston, note that the company \"locked down\" the retirement plan from Oct. 17 to Nov. 19 to make administrative changes. That prevented all employees, regardless of age, from selling any Enron shares in their 401(k)s as the stock price collapsed amid financial turmoil at the company and an SEC investigation into its accounting practices. Enron says it doesn't comment on pending litigation.  Those lawsuits, along with a handful filed against other companies recently, don't take on directly the practice of forcing employees to accept and hold company stock in their 401(k)s. That's perfectly legal. So whatever the outcome, a company would still be able to restrict employee sales of company-stock contributions to 401(k) before the price declines. \"Even when they've had gains, they can't really lock them in because they can't diversify,\" says Randall Shoker, an Oxford, Ohio, financial adviser.  Michael Green knows that. The 35-year-old investment specialist joined Dell Computer Corp. in 1995 as a product manager. He and his wife, Lisa, an assistant controller at the company, were thrilled as the stock rose to about $51 a share in late 1999 from $1 in mid-1995, adjusted for splits.  But by the late '90s, the couple felt overexposed to Dell. In addition to the Dell stock that the company had contributed to their 401(k) plans, they had received stock options as bonuses. And they had bought a home in Austin, Texas, where the real-estate market is tied in part to the fortunes of Dell, one of the area's biggest employers.  The Greens sold some of the stock they received as bonuses. But Dell wouldn't let employees sell shares the company contributed to their retirement accounts until they had been at the company for five years. \"I tried so hard to sell,\" Mr. Green says. \"We went around and around.\"  The company changed its policy last year to allow all Dell employees to sell the shares in their 401(k) plan and shift the proceeds into alternatives available through the plan. By then, though, Dell shares had plummeted, erasing $200,000 from the Greens' 401(k) accounts. \"That's as much as we paid for our house,\" Mr. Green says. Both left Dell earlier this year for other jobs.  SEC filings show that Dell executives, though subject to the same restrictions on their regular 401(k) accounts, can participate in a supplementary retirement-savings plan that allows them immediately to reinvest the company's contribution in a variety of options. Executives have seized that opportunity: Just 9% of the supplementary retirement plan was invested in Dell stock at the end of last year, according to the company's latest 11K filing, compared with about 50% of Dell's 401(k) plan.  Dell spokesman T.R. Reid declines to comment on the Greens' circumstances. He says that any employees who lose so much money on company contributions could do so only because they had made a bundle until that point. And providing Dell shares to the employee retirement-savings plan, he says, \"certainly provides incentive to not only think but act like a shareholder.\"  The company ended the five-year lock-down rule, Mr. Reid says, because it was no longer necessary to keep employees focused on improving Dell's shareholder value. And he says Dell executives don't have to hold company stock in their supplementary plan because they \"receive a significant portion of their compensation in Dell stock,\" and thus they already \"have the broader interests of the company and shareholders squarely in their sights.\"  SEC filings show that Dell executives nonetheless have means to protect themselves from exposure to the company's stock. Michael Dell, chairman and chief executive of the computer company he founded, transferred a total of 4.1 million shares, worth $190.7 million, into so-called exchange funds in several transactions between September 1999 and May 2000. (The shares accounted for about 1.3% of Mr. Dell's total company holdings at the time).  Offered by financial firms to the wealthy, exchange funds are, in essence, mutual funds that allow holders of large chunks of a single stock to pool their assets, giving them a stake in a diversified, less-risky basket of securities and, in some cases, postponing tax liabilities. Altogether, the value of Mr. Dell's hedged shares would have fallen in market value by 38%, or $73 million, by earlier this month had he taken no precautions. (The return on the diversified exchange fund isn't disclosed).  Until the five-year rule was lifted, employees like Mr. Green could get out of their Dell 401(k) holdings only by withdrawing money from their accounts, paying income tax and a 10% penalty on the withdrawal, and then reinvesting the difference.  Or, says Dell spokesman Mike Maher, they could have elected \"to take their compensation and not put it in their 401(k), and invest it in some other stock.\" By doing so, however, they would have forgone the company's matching contribution altogether. Mr. Maher declines to comment on Mr. Dell's transactions. He notes that like executives, regular employees who receive options are free to sell their shares. \"We're all playing by the same rules,\" he says.  The hedging maneuvers executives can employ to protect their company holdings fall largely off the radar screens of regulators and shareholders. While the SEC generally requires that key executives report these transactions, experts say the rules are largely ignored. \"We really are only able to uncover several a month at most, which leads me to believe that the insiders are not filing these as often as they should,\" says Lon Gerber, director of research at Thomson Financial/Lancer Analytics, which combs SEC filings to track insider trading trends.  Mr. Dweck, head of the Goldman Sachs division that manages single-stock investments for wealthy investors, says his group's clients disclose their transactions when required. And Qwest Chairman Philip Anschutz recently disclosed that last May, he entered into a \"forward-sale agreement\" with a brokerage firm, locking in as many as 10 million Qwest shares at close to their then-current price. Qwest's share price has since fallen 68%; the value of Mr. Anschutz's shares covered in the agreement would have plunged to $127 million from $394 million. (Those shares amounted to about 3.3% of Mr. Anschutz's total holding of 300 million shares, or 18% of Qwest's shares outstanding, both directly and through a company he controls.)  A forward-sale agreement wasn't available to Joseph Daugherty. He has been stringing and repairing telephone cable for 23 years, first for Bell South Corp. and then in the Salt Lake City area for U S West, which was acquired by Qwest last year.  A few months ago, he was looking forward to early retirement next summer. But now, he says, he'll have to keep working. The $200,000 in assets he had in his 401(k) in early May has shrunk to roughly $50,000. Part of that loss is attributable to the retirement plan's rules, which don't allow most workers to shift out of company-contributed Qwest shares until age 55. Mr. Daugherty, who concedes he's a risk-taker, blames himself for the rest: He voluntarily sank the remainder of his 401(k) savings into Qwest stock.  Qwest won't comment on the finances of either Mr. Daugherty or Mr. Anschutz. But Steve Hammack, a Qwest spokesman, says U S West established the policy of contributing company stock. He notes that starting Jan. 1, 2001, the company began allowing managers to diversify company stock contributions they receive this year into other investments available through the plan. The restrictions on union members, he says, are covered by the company's collective bargaining agreement.  \"The fact is,\" Mr. Hammack responds in an email, \"the majority of companies in the U.S. that match employee contributions do so in their own company stock. A good number also restrict employees from diversifying out of the company match.\"  Erisa, the federal law governing pension plans, provides employees with little legal traction to complain about their forced 401(k) holdings. Employer contributions to retirement-savings plans aren't generally subject to fiduciary rules. (As for employee contributions, employers are supposed to choose \"prudent\" investment options.)  Retirement-savings plans are exempt from Erisa diversification rules, too. These rules make it illegal for a company's pension plan to invest more than 10% of its assets in the company's own securities. But savings plans such as 401(k)s can generally invest as much as 100% of the assets in company stock with impunity. Currently, roughly one-third to one-half of retirement-plan assets at large companies are invested in company stock. That suits employers, which would just as soon contribute stock as draw down precious cash, and in the past, they have lobbied successfully to defeat efforts to impose diversification rules on 401(k)s.  That confounds people such as Mr. Triska, the technician at Enron's Portland General Electric unit. \"Anyone will tell you that you need to diversify to reduce risk,\" he says.  Diversification has spared Mr. Triska some of the pain experienced by co-workers who bet big on Enron in their retirement savings. Since Sept. 10, while the Enron shares in his 401(k) have plunged 86%, his shares in Weitz Partners Value Fund have declined only 4.52%, and his shares in Fidelity Growth Company and Janus Global Life Sciences funds have risen 7.3% and 2.2%, respectively.  Enron executives are subject to the same restrictions on Enron's stock contributions to their 401(k)s as other employees: no sales of company-contributed stock until age 50. But company filings with the SEC show that \"key management and highly compensated employees\" also participate in separate retirement-savings plans that don't require them to hold Enron stock at all. Executives can pile as much as 35% of their salaries and 100% of their bonuses annually into these accounts, allocating the money among a variety of investments.  Further, SEC filings show that so far this year, many Enron executives were steady sellers of company stock they had accumulated beyond the ambit of their 401(k)s. Former Enron Broadband Services Chief Executive Kenneth Rice, for example, sold Enron shares valued at $23.7 million during the period, and former CEO Jeffrey Skilling sold $27.5 million of Enron stock.  \"We believe it's important for employees to have a stake in the company,\" says Karen Denne, a spokeswoman for Enron. \"It's also important that we align employee and company performance.\"  ---  Cassell Bryan-Low contributed to this article.

Enron shares off 15% on doubts about deal Dynegy's $9-billion buyout offer might not be completed under original terms KRISTEN HAYS  11/27/2001  The Globe and Mail  Metro  Page B11  \"All material Copyright (c) Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc. and its licensors. All rights reserved.\"  HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. shares fell another 15 per cent yesterday, and briefly traded below their all-time low, as investors continued to doubt that a $9-billion (U.S.) buyout offer from rival Dynegy Inc. would be completed under the current terms.  Enron's stock slide, coupled with traders shying away from Enron's core energy trading business that Dynegy wants most, raises the question of whether the energy giant can maintain enough assets to keep Dynegy interested, said Mike Heim, an analyst with A.G. Edwards & Sons.  \"I think Dynegy's really got Enron's back against the wall and at a minimum, I think restructuring is possible,\" Mr. Heim said.  Dynegy spokesman John Sousa reiterated yesterday that the company is moving forward with the acquisition of its larger, troubled rival and \"we are continuing to conduct our confirmatory due diligence.\"  Enron stock fell as low as $3.76 before rebounding somewhat to close at $4.01, down 70 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. That's 60 per cent below the current value of Dynegy's offer of $10.54 a share based on Dynegy's close of $39.25, down $1.15 for the day.  Enron's all-time trading low was a split-adjusted $3.94 on Oct. 27, 1987, according to the Center for Research in Security Prices at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business.  Enron shares have plunged more than 95 per cent from their February 52-week high of $84.87, as the company's complicated finances began to unravel and raised concerns about its financial viability.  The merger agreement between the two Houston-based companies contains an escape clause that would allow Dynegy to back out if Enron suffers serious loss in business or assets.  Mr. Heim said Dynegy has a good argument to trigger that clause, given Enron's predictions of fourth-quarter losses and erosion of traders.  But Raymond James analyst Jon Kyle Cartwright said that while a renegotiation is reasonable, it is doubtful Dynegy will abandon the deal.     Battered Enron in Search of $1 Billion; Stock's Decline Raises Doubts About Buyout Peter Behr  11/27/2001  The Washington Post  FINAL  Page E01  Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved  Shunned by investors and deserted by many former customers, Enron Corp. is searching this week for up to $1 billion in cash from lenders to sustain its once dominant energy-trading business.  Enron stock fell yesterday to new low of $4.01 a share, down 70 cents, continuing the latest plunge that began last week when the Houston company disclosed still more damaging detail about its financial condition.  A year ago, Enron stock traded for more than $78 a share, based on its leading position then as a trader of power, natural gas, various industrial and telecommunications products and financial contracts linked to these commodities.  Dynegy Inc., Enron's Houston rival, said yesterday it was not moving away from its $23 billion cash and debt offer to buy Enron. Enron declined to comment on its financial problems.  But Enron's stock has dropped more than 50 percent since the Dynegy deal was announced Nov. 9. Investors believe that Dynegy will renegotiate the deal at a cheaper price or even try to abandon it, said Brian Youngberg, a financial analyst with Edward D. Jones & Co. in St. Louis.  \"The [Dynegy] deal values Enron at more than $10 a share. For a company that's trading at $4, that doesn't make much sense,\" said Youngberg, who last week recommended that customers sell Enron shares.  As part of the Dynegy deal, Enron received $1.5 billion in cash, secured by stock in one of its pipelines. But without another large infusion of cash, the company faces what Youngberg called a \"death spiral.\"  Along with investors, many energy buyers and traders have lost confidence in Enron's ability to make good on the long-term energy contracts it specializes in, Youngberg said. Enron's most important operations involve contracts to deliver natural gas, electric power and other energy products to industries and utilities in the future. It also sells financial instruments designed to protect customers against sharp swings in energy prices.  These deals are the one part of Enron that Dynegy wants.  \"Their core business has dropped off sharply,\" said Andrew Meade, an analyst with Commerzbank Securities in New York. Enron remains a sizable player in the huge daily trading of energy products, but is being frozen out of long-term markets and relegated to less profitable short-term trades, said Meade.  The lengthy span of Enron's crisis, which began a month ago when it reported a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity, has given companies time to close out contracts with Enron or limit their potential losses if Enron were to fail, said Louis B. Gagliardi, an analyst with John S. Herold Inc. in Connecticut.  \"If Enron went to a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, or failed, it would unsettle the market slightly. But it wouldn't catch people by surprise. So there's not much danger of a crisis on the natural gas or power side\" of energy trading, Gagliardi said. Other market participants cautioned that the extent of Enron's obligations to trading partners is not known to outsiders, making the impact of an Enron failure hard to assess.  Dynegy and its partner, ChevronTexaco Corp., could pump billions of dollars into Enron's operations if the purchase went through, but under the best of circumstances, regulatory review of the deal will drag on for another six months. Investors and traders are increasingly doubtful that Enron can hang around that long by itself, \"That just adds to the uncertainty about the stock,\" Gagliardi said.  Dynegy's offer for Enron caused a brief rally in Enron's stock price and outlook.  But that flurry of optimism was halted by a new financial report last week to the Securities and Exchange Commission detailing even more serious debt obligations than the company had previously acknowledged.  Enron was able to negotiate a three-week extension on a $690 million note that was coming due this week and finished arrangements on a $450 million line of credit, part of a $1 billion infusion it had previously announced.  However, the $690 million obligation, disclosed in the SEC filing, was a very pointed alert to investors about Enron's growing cash needs, Meade said.  And the new details of Enron's plight in last week's filing further damaged the credibility of the company's financial reporting, Meade said.  \"I don't think they have fully restated their earnings. There is probably more to come, Meade said.\"  Enron's board has turned to an outside committee to assess the company's financial condition, after acknowledging last month that Enron had overstated earnings by $586 million over the past four years.  The restatement was caused primarily by accounting decisions that concealed losses in a series of limited partnerships that Enron had helped create to buy various energy, water supply and Internet network properties it wanted to dispose of, the company said.  On Nov. 14, Enron's new chief financial officer, Jeff McMahon, briefed analysts on a series of steps the company would take to raise cash, including the current quest for $500 million to $1 billion in loans. Enron, its executives said, will reorganize the company around its business that generated the strongest cash flow -- energy trades, gas pipeline and coal operations. Other assets, worth $8 billion in book value, would be put up for sale \"in an orderly fashion.\"  Then came the new disclosures last week, reinforcing analysts' concerns that the depths of Enron's liabilities have not yet been plumbed.  \"The issues that brought Enron to this point are unresolved. It's a balance sheet that doesn't stand still and continues to deteriorate,\" Gagliardi said.   http://www.washingtonpost.com  Contact: http://www.washingtonpost.com     INDIA: Enron India unit, lenders to meet in UK this week.  11/27/2001  Reuters English News Service  (C) Reuters Limited 2001.  BOMBAY, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Enron Corp's troubled Indian unit and its foreign lenders will hold separate meetings this week to decide the fate of a power project once considered the showpiece of India's reform programme, a banking source said on Tuesday.  The meetings, to be held in London on Friday and Saturday, will consider proposals to allow the Dabhol Power Company, which is 65 percent owned by Enron, to pull the plug on a contract to sell power from a giant power project, he said.  The $2.9 billion, 2,184 MW project, which is India's largest foreign direct investment, has been shut since June this year following a dispute with its sole buyer the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB).  The departure of Enron and its partners would be another blow to attempts to attract foreign investment into the domestic power sector.  Five foreign companies have either pulled out or announced plans to exit the sector, fed up with bureaucratic delays and legal wrangling over the past few years.  At the same time, parent Enron Corp of the United States is struggling to ward off bankruptcy and save its proposed buyout by smaller rival Dynegy Inc.  Its share price has already taken a beating this year over widespread investor doubts about its corporate governance practices. Enron shares closed down 73 cents, or 15.4 percent, at $4.01 on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Monday, after dipping to at least an 18-year-low of $3.76.  A Dabhol spokesman in Bombay confirmed that the Dabhol board is meeting in November 30 in London. But he declined to disclose the agenda.  The banking source said the Dabhol board will consider giving the management authorisation to issue a final termination notice to the MSEB.  Foreign lenders, led by Citibank and Bank of America, are meeting in London on the same day and will also consider giving Dabhol permission to issue such a notice.  Under a 1995 agreement between Dabhol and MSEB in 1995, the company needs lenders' permission before issuing a terminating notice.  Once issued, the notice would trigger international arbitration to resolve arguments over damages.  MEGA PROJECT  Dabhol and MSEB have been feuding for more than a year over payment defaults and high tariffs. The dispute stopped work on the second phase of the unit which is 97 percent complete.  Enron and its fellow U.S. investors General Electric Co and Bechtel, fed up with payment defaults, have already announced their intentions to exit the project.  They have agreed to sell their stake of 85 percent to either the Indian government or a private power company. At the same time, they have also proceeded with plans to cancel the contract.  A preliminary cancellation notice was issued in May this year. This was to be followed up by a final termination notice after six months. That six-month deadline expired on November 19.  But Dabhol was prevented from taking the final step by a Bombay court. Acting on an urgent petition by Indian lenders, who were against the termination, the court asked Dabhol not to issue such a notice until December 3.  The banking source said Dabhol is only trying to secure all approvals and would not actually issue the notice on November 30.     Enron Talking With Dynegy As They Work To Rescue Deal By By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN  11/27/2001  The New York Times  Page 1, Column 5  c. 2001 New York Times Company  The Enron Corporation and its would-be rescuer, Dynegy Inc., are renegotiating the terms of their deal, originally valued at $9 billion, executives close to the discussions said yesterday.  There were several issues still on the table last night, and the situation was very fluid, the executives said. But they said that the companies hoped to announce, perhaps as early as today, a series of changes: a lower price for the takeover; a cash infusion of $500 million; an agreement by some banks to extend the repayment dates of Enron debt until after the deal closes; and possibly an agreement making clear that the merger would not be derailed by litigation over Enron's devastated employee-retirement plan.  The sides were also negotiating ways to tighten clauses in the merger agreement so that Dynegy would not be able to use information from Enron's recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a reason for backing out of the deal.  Both companies declined to comment on whether renegotiations were taking place.  But according to executives close to the talks, the new terms would lower the ratio of Dynegy stock to be exchanged to roughly 0.15 share for each share of Enron. The original deal, announced Nov. 9, called for each Enron share to be exchanged for 0.2685 share of Dynegy. But Enron's shares have been plunging steadily, and yesterday the current offer was valued at 163 percent over Enron's closing price.  The companies hope that by releasing some good news, they can stem the slide in the price of Enron's stock and traded debt. Enron shares, which have been plunging since mid-October when the company began to disclose a series of losses and accounting errors, closed yesterday at $4.01, down 14.9 percent, or 70 cents. Shares of Dynegy closed at $39.25 yesterday, down 2.9 percent, or $1.15.  More important, the executives close to the talks said, the companies hope to restore confidence in Enron's energy-trading operation, which showed signs of deterioration yesterday. In recent years, Enron has traded more natural gas and electricity than its two biggest competitors combined, and its trading floor is viewed as its most valuable franchise, accounting for most of the company's profit.  Dynegy's biggest worry, according to the executives, is that this core business is deteriorating. The company fears that if other energy traders further curtail their business with Enron -- either on their own or in response to another cut in Enron's credit rating -- then much of the value of the company could be wiped out, they said.  The urgency of the situation has been made clear by the way in which Enron is being treated in the energy-trading markets, some analysts and executives at rival energy companies say. Though some large traders are still doing business with Enron, many other traders have curtailed their dealings with the company for fear they may not get paid if Enron collapses and files for bankruptcy protection.  In addition, some of the energy trading Enron is doing is costing it more money because of credit concerns. For example, analysts and energy executives say, Enron is in some cases being forced to pay 3 cents to 6 cents more per million British thermal units of natural gas. That means instead of paying perhaps $1.80 per million B.T.U.'s in some trades, it may be paying $1.84.  Jeff Dietert, an analyst with Simmons & Company in Houston, said the price discrepancies on some trades were also showing up on EnronOnline, the Internet platform that accounts for much of the company's trading with other parties.  ''We're seeing Enron's prices,'' Mr. Dietert said, ''be about a nickel higher on EnronOnline versus some of the competing Internet-based exchanges.'' If these credit premiums should continue, it could erode Enron's trading profits and worsen its already tenuous liquidity situation.  An Enron spokeswoman, Karen Denne, said trading volumes were ''below average,'' yesterday, but she declined to be more specific. She did say the company was in discussions about a new equity infusion of $500 million to $1 billion.  According to executives close to the talks, details were still being worked out on the cash infusion, which would come from Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase. Dynegy may also add cash to the deal while reaffirming the company's commitment to the merger.  Executives at rival trading companies said Dynegy needed to do something to bolster confidence in Enron's trading operations.  ''In places, Enron is paying up to 4 or 5 or 6 cents more for next-day gas,'' said an executive at one large energy trader. ''Some producers out there don't want to sell additional discretionary gas to Enron, so they're having to pay up.''  The executive also said most energy traders expected that Dynegy would obtain a much lower merger price because Enron had little or no room to fight a renegotiation.  ''If Enron hasn't lined something else up, their other choice is bankruptcy,'' he said. ''You can guess what shareholder value is going to look like if that's the case.''     Report: U.S. Pipelines a Target / FBI warns gas, oil firms of vague threat Tom Brune. WASHINGTON BUREAU  11/27/2001  Newsday  NASSAU AND SUFFOLK  Page A49  (Copyright Newsday Inc., 2001)  Washington - According to an unverified intelligence report, Osama bin Laden has ordered retaliatory attacks on U.S. natural gas supplies should he or the Taliban's leader be killed or captured, Attorney General John Ashcroft said yesterday.  The U.S. oil and natural gas industry confirmed yesterday that it went on a higher stage of alert within the past two weeks after the FBI advised the American Petroleum Institute and other national industry groups of the vague, alleged threat.  On Nov. 17, the FBI sent e-mails to its 56 field offices across the country - but not to state and local law enforcement officials - about the alleged threat, which is being taken seriously although the agency has not determined whether it is credible, Justice officials said.  The notice warned that bin Laden may have approved plans to attack natural gas supplies in the event he or Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar was captured or killed. The FBI said the information \"was from a source of undetermined reliability.\"  Asked about the notice yesterday, Ashcroft said, \"Frankly, those are the kinds of reports which we take seriously ... and we work to elevate our security to alert the interested industry groups, to alert law enforcement.\"  Ashcroft sought to downplay the threat as an act of retaliation ordered by bin Laden, the U.S. government's prime suspect in the Sept. 11 attacks and the leader of al-Qaida terrorist network now being pursued by U.S. forces in Afghanistan.  \"I don't believe al-Qaida operates on the basis of triggering attacks. ... This is an organization motivated by hate,\" Ashcroft said. \"We are at risk not based on our activities, but based on their malicious despising of the United States.\"  Justice officials said the natural gas threat lacked the verification that led Ashcroft and FBI Director Robert Mueller to publicly issue nationwide alerts twice last month.  The notice about the natural gas threat was one of many the FBI has sent to its field offices for vigilance and communication to those who might be affected, a Justice official said.  The notice of the natural gas threat came after Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) on Nov. 7 forced federal regulators to reconsider a permit that would allow the reopening of a liquefied natural gas plant at Cove Point in Maryland. She warned that \"the Cove Point facility is within three miles of the Calvert Cliffs nuclear power plant, and the ships carrying liquefied natural gas from Algeria or other countries will be under foreign flag with foreign crews.\"  Energy companies have stepped up security at refineries, pipeline pumping stations and other facilities since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington and the U.S. retaliatory attacks in Afghanistan.  There are thousands of miles of natural gas and petroleum pipelines crossing North America, making protection difficult. Aerial monitoring has increased and security has been intensified at pipeline pumping stations, industry officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press.  Also, some detailed information about locations of pipelines and other energy infrastructure have been taken off some corporate and government Internet sites. Access to facilities has been tightened as well, officials said.     Investors bet Enron deal will go bust ; Dynegy could kill deal or drop price James P Miller, Tribune staff reporter Reuters news service contributed to this report  11/27/2001  Chicago Tribune  North Sports Final ; N  Page 1  (Copyright 2001 by the Chicago Tribune)  As Dynegy Inc. continued to scrutinize merger partner Enron Corp.'s tangled finances, Wall Street traders bet that Dynegy is on the verge of either calling off the Enron buyout it announced three weeks ago or renegotiating a much cheaper price for its once- highflying rival.  \"The market is acting like the deal is not going through or not going through at the original terms,\" said A.G. Edwards analyst Michael Heim.  The New York Times reported the companies as early as Tuesday could announce a new deal, which could reduce by nearly half Dynegy's $9 billion takeover offer.  Under terms of the original agreement between the two Houston- based energy concerns, Enron stockholders are to swap each of their shares for little more than a quarter-share of Dynegy stock, which closed Monday at $39.25. That would value Enron shares at $10.54.  If investors believed the stock-for-stock deal was likely to go through, they would be willing to pay something very close to that price for Enron shares--but they're not.  As investor doubts have grown, so has the gap between the buyout price and the trading price of Enron's stock. On Monday, Enron's battered shares slid to their lowest level in years, dropping 70 cents, or 15 percent, to close at $4.01.  Enron's market capitalization--the value of the company's approximately 850 million shares--has plunged to $3.41 billion. In February, Enron's market cap was about $70 billion.  With Monday's slippage, Enron shares are trading at a 62 percent discount to the Dynegy offer. The shares of acquisition targets typically trade at a less than 10 percent discount to the deal price after a merger announcement.  Dynegy saying little  As Dynegy's audit team continued its in-depth review of Enron's books Monday, a company spokesman declined to discuss rumors swirling around the deal. \"The due diligence continues,\" said John Sousa, the Dynegy spokesman. \"We're looking closely at Enron.\"  Asked about one analyst's recent projection that Dynegy may renegotiate the transaction's exchange ratio and give Enron holders just 0.15 Dynegy shares for each Enron share, rather than the agreed upon 0.2685 ratio, Sousa said, \"We don't comment on speculation.\"  There is no shortage of speculation of late in the \"soap opera that is Enron,\" said commentator Carol Levenson of the Gimme Credit bond market newsletter.  Levenson suggested that \"there's a game of chicken going on between Enron, its bankers, its ostensible merger partner, Dynegy, and the rating agencies.\" Any of the parties \"could send this company over the edge at any moment,\" she said, and Enron \"is in an increasingly weak negotiating position.\"  Enron's fall from grace has been astonishingly swift and painful for its stockholders, some of whom are suing the company for allegedly using misleading accounting measures to conceal the shaky state of its finances.  With Monday's drop, Enron shares have tumbled 95 percent from the $82 they commanded just 10 months ago.  Once a regional pipeline operator known as Houston Natural Gas, Enron transformed itself during the 1990s through an ambitious expansion plan. It acquired electric utility operations, built overseas power plants and developed an innovative energy trading operation.  Partnership woes  The strategy made Enron a stock market darling, but it also periodically strained the company's liquidity. To help keep its credit ratings strong, the company created limited partnerships that allowed Enron to keep billions of dollars in debt obligations off its books and out of sight of most investors.  While Enron's power trading group has experienced operating problems of late, it is the limited partnerships--some of which were managed by Enron officials--that proved to be the company's downfall.  In October, Enron disclosed that it had shrunk its shareholder equity by $1.2 billion to buy back 55 million shares it had issued to the partnerships. The charge associated with \"unwinding\" the web of partnerships stunned investors by giving the company an unforeseen $618 million third-quarter loss. It also spurred a markdown of Enron's credit ratings to just above junk-bond status, as well as a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into Enron's partnership practices.  As further accounting difficulties surfaced, Enron's finances have turned increasingly shaky, and some other trading companies, fearing exposure to Enron's problems, have become reluctant do new transactions with the company.  As part of the buyout arrangement, Dynegy's 26 percent owner, Chevron-Texaco Corp., has given Enron $1.5 billion in upfront cash; in exchange, Dynegy obtained rights that would allow it to acquire the desirable Northern Natural Gas Co. pipeline if the deal falls through.  Dynegy has the right to walk away from the deal if Enron suffers what's known as a \"material adverse change.\" But as Tyson Foods Inc. found out this year when it unsuccessfully sought to break its agreement to buy meatpacker IBP Inc. after an accounting mess at IBP, proving such a claim can be difficult.

''stimulus'' plan calls for United States taxpayers to give Enron $254 million. Since it was Enron management's greed that ran the company into multibillion-dollar debt, why should we citizens pay for its irresponsibility?  ARLIE SCHARDT  Washington, Nov. 20, 2001  Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.      Business/Financial Desk; Section C Top Companies Issuing Debt At a Fast Pace By STEPHANIE STROM  11/27/2001 The New York Times Page 1, Column 5 c. 2001 New York Times Company  In the weeks since the attack on the World Trade Center, blue-chip corporations have issued a torrent of debt.  Ford, General Electric, I.B.M., Kraft, AT&T, General Motors and other companies have doubled and even trebled their initial plans for bond offerings as investors, disenchanted with the stock market, have all but begged to buy their debt. In all, companies have issued 31.5 percent more debt in the last 11 weeks than they did in the period a year earlier. The companies are taking advantage of the chance to raise cash at bargain basement prices, thanks to low interest rates, and to retire more expensive debt.  But they may also have little-discussed concerns that money will be scarce in the future, particularly if the economic downturn persists and the recovery is less vigorous than economists now hope. Bank lending is at a 30-year low, according to the Conference Board, and buyers are hard to find for commercial paper, the short-term, cheap debt that corporate purebreds rely on. Standard & Poor's says the amount of commercial paper issued by nonfinancial companies has shrunk roughly 30 percent this year.  ''Companies now can lock in substantially lower overall borrowing costs,'' said William Cunningham, director of credit strategy at J. P. Morgan. ''They have an opportunity to build a war chest to help them get through the hard times, and they're taking advantage of it.''  Before the terrorist attacks, analysts were expecting the issuing of debt to slow late this year after a tremendous first half.  So much for expectations. Ford originally planned to raise $3 billion; it was able to raise $9.4 billion and is said to be thinking about trying to raise $7 billion more.  Kraft Foods, part of the Philip Morris Companies, had planned to issue $2 billion worth of bonds. Instead, it offered $4 billion.  AT&T raised $10.1 billion, twice as much as it originally planned. AT&T's and Ford's issues rank as the second- and third-largest ever.  All told, 573 corporations have issued $181 billion of debt since Sept. 11, compared with 692 companies that raised $138 billion in the period last year, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.  ''When you look at other asset classes, the corporate bond market offers some of the better values,'' said Bob LoBue, head of the investment-grade fixed-income syndicate at J. P. Morgan, which has underwritten roughly half the issues that have come to market since Sept. 11. ''There's still a lack of confidence in stock valuations based on the weakness we're seeing in earnings.''  Issuers and their underwriters most often cite the low interest rates on Treasury bills as the reason for the surge in corporate debt. Corporate bonds are often priced in relation to United States government debt, and thanks to a cascade of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve this year, well-heeled companies can borrow at extremely attractive rates.  International Business Machines, for instance, recently sold $1.5 billion worth of five-year notes with the lowest coupon it has ever issued, 4.875 percent.  Others, though, read the stampede of premier companies to issue debt as a sign that credit is getting tight. Investment-grade companies typically juggle a smorgasbord of debt -- short, intermediate and long term -- but they are definitely skewing the mixture toward the long end these days. No doubt, that is because debt is cheap -- but it also suggests that they may foresee a time when money will be more scarce and are accumulating the war chests Mr. Cunningham referred to.  It was not so long ago, after all, that companies experienced a credit shortage. ''A credit crunch was brewing last year,'' Mr. Cunningham said, ''until the Fed stepped in and started aggressively lowering interest rates, which averted it.''  But a cash problem persists in some ways despite the Federal Reserve's series of interest rate cuts. ''We are in a cash crisis like none we have experienced in recent memory,'' said James Padilla, a Ford executive, in a recent memorandum to his staff.  Many companies with less-than-pristine credit ratings have trouble raising money and may be having more because of the stampede by blue-chip companies.  ''When companies like Ford or General Electric come into the market, they squeeze a lot of other, somewhat riskier credits out,'' said Gail D. Fosler, the chief economist at the Conference Board.  Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at the Harris Trust and Savings Bank, said that the economic recovery depended on companies' being able to get credit.  ''My primary concern is the lack of available credit across the spectrum,'' he said. ''We are forecasting an economic recovery in the middle of next year, but the one thing that could go wrong with that forecast is if the availability of credit stays where it is or gets worse.''  Another concern is that debt is piling up with negative consequences. ''The Fed is trying to prevent the bubble from bursting by keeping the forces of credit exuberance alive,'' Barton M. Biggs, chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley, wrote to investors earlier this month. ''The trouble is, although it may work in the short run, in the long run the debt burden will be bigger and the adjustment process more painful.''  The automakers, for example, are using the money they have raised in part to support the customer incentive programs that offer zero-interest financing. They are paying as much as 7.25 percent, in other words, to lend money to car buyers for nothing.  Some of the new debt is being used to retire commercial paper. But companies are taking on more than they need to accomplish that goal.  The longer-term money they are borrowing is more expensive than the commercial paper, even if it is cheaper than it has been in a long time. The spread -- the difference in interest rates between Treasuries and corporate bonds -- has generally widened since Sept. 11, although not across the board.  ''There is a cost factor involved, but we try to minimize that,'' said David Moore, manager of fixed-income investor relations at Ford Credit, which accounted for the bulk of the $9.4 billion that Ford borrowed last month. ''We're mindful of our liquidity, and want to make sure we ensure it.''  Like many of the companies issuing debt, Ford is curbing its dependence on the commercial paper market. For the year through Oct. 16, Ford had cut the amount of paper it had outstanding by almost 60 percent, to $17 billion. ''That puts us in a very good position, given our rating,'' said Mr. Moore, who was one of the few executives willing to discuss his company's strategy.  Ford, like a host of other companies, has had its credit ratings cut. Many buyers of commercial paper, like money market funds, lend to only the highest-rated companies. So far this year, Standard & Poor's has knocked 57 companies out of the top ratings for commercial paper, compared with 49 last year.  The total amount of outstanding commercial paper has fallen 30 percent this year, according to Diane Vazza, head of global financial investment research at Standard & Poor's, thanks to that downgrading and to great caution among investors. ''We've seen some issuers driven out of the market,'' Ms. Vazza said.  According to several credit analysts, DaimlerChrysler was scheduled to roll over $7 billion of commercial paper in June but decided to take the offering to Europe, where investors are less particular about ratings quality.  Similarly, Enron careered into its crisis when it was forced to redeem commercial paper as its credit ratings fell.  The decline in AT&T's commercial paper ratings was one reason for its big issue last week.  But underwriters of corporate debt insist that the decline in the commercial paper market has more to do with companies' ability to borrow for the long term cheaply than with their inability to issue short-term debt. ''Short-term financing does come with a maturity risk in that you constantly have to roll it over in order to maintain liquidity,'' said Mr. LoBue of J. P. Morgan.  The underwriters concede, however, that lending by banks has all but dried up, falling to its lowest level in three decades. Bank lending has been curtailed at the behest of Federal regulators like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency at the Treasury Department, putting them seemingly at cross-purposes with the Fed.  The chief executive of EchoStar, Charles W. Ergen, had to put up $2.75 billion of his own money to complete the purchase of the Hughes Electronic Corporation. The bankers at UBS Warburg, EchoStar's adviser on the deal, had offered to provide the financing, but only with a proviso that would have let the bank back out of the deal under certain conditions.  Although the company later got financing from Credit Suisse First Boston and Deutsche Bank, many other bankers have privately applauded UBS Warburg's caution.

Nov. 27, 2001 Houston Chronicle Enron, Dynegy deal back on table  Energy traders said to be renegotiating premium for shares  By LAURA GOLDBERG  Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle  Dynegy and Enron Corp. could announce new terms for Dynegy's deal to buy Enron as soon as today, according to sources familiar with talks between the two companies.  The two Houston-based energy traders, the sources said, spent the weekend and Monday discussing, among other issues, a lower exchange rate for Dynegy's stock deal to buy Enron.  As of Monday evening, no exchange rate had been agreed to and discussions were continuing, the sources said, cautioning that the situation was fluid.  Also Monday:  ? Enron and Dynegy, the sources said, were working to finalize terms for an equity infusion into Enron of around $500 million that's expected to come from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup. Another equity infusion from other parties could come later, the sources said.  ? Enron, Dynegy and a group of banks were negotiating terms for a so-called \"override\" agreement that would extend, until after the merger closed, maturity dates for certain debt Enron is due to repay or that could come due before, the sources said. It was unclear how much of approximately the $9 billion in obligations Enron could have coming due in the next 12 months that would be covered by that restructuring.  ? It was expected that Enron would start layoffs sometime this week.  Karen Denne, an Enron spokeswoman, said her only comment was that any action the company would take concerning job cuts would be communicated first to employees.  ? California Attorney General Bill Lockyer, not known for harboring a favorable attitude toward Enron or other Texas energy companies, has started reviewing the planned merger, looking for potential antitrust problems, his office said. Dynegy has power plants there, while Enron sells power and natural gas into the state.  ? Shares in both companies fell, with Enron closing down 70 cents at $4.01, while shares in Dynegy ended the day down $1.15 at $39.25.  The talks between Enron and Dynegy come amid Wall Street expectations that Dynegy will renegotiate the merger terms or back out of the deal completely. The sources said that at the moment, the companies aren't discussing canceling the deal.  On Nov. 9, the day Dynegy announced it would acquire its troubled rival, shares in Enron closed at $8.63, while shares in Dynegy closed at $38.76.  The merger agreement calls for Enron shareholders to get 0.2685 share of Dynegy per Enron share. Based on the Nov. 9 closing prices, Dynegy would be paying $10.41 a share for Enron.  But since, Enron's share prices have dropped significantly amid increasing concerns about its ability to maintain its core trading business and troubling new disclosures about its financial shape.  Based on Monday's closing prices, Dynegy would be paying more -- $10.54 a share -- for Enron, which is worth considerably less based on market capitalization than when the deal was announced.  Last week, one stock analyst said he thought a ratio of no more than 0.15 share of Dynegy per Enron share might be more realistic.  Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said Monday that Dynegy was continuing its \"due diligence\" review of Enron's books and \"looking at everything very closely.\"  Unless the merger with Dynegy goes through, Enron could be forced into bankruptcy protection.  Enron's core trading business has eroded, the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating its finances and it faces a pile of debt as well as an increasing number of shareholder and employee lawsuits.  Enron and Dynegy hoped the merger deal, which included an immediate infusion of $1.5 billion of equity into Enron, would stabilize Enron.  But new financial disclosures have had the opposite effect.  For example, on Nov. 19, Enron revealed $690 million in debt would come due sooner than expected because of a credit-rating downgrade.  The news came as a surprise even to Dynegy.  Dynegy has escape hatches in its merger agreement, including a \"material adverse change\" clause that applies generally to Enron's financial state.  Also, if the amount of legal and shareholder claims Enron must pay out is greater than $3.5 billion, the deal can be called off.  Sousa described the escape clauses as \"broad provisions\" to ensure Dynegy is adequately protected.    Nov. 27, 2001 Houston Chronicle Sizable staff of 245 lawyers in merger limbo  By MARY FLOOD  Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle  Whether troubled Enron Corp. merges, falls or stays the course, it is likely to deeply affect one of Houston's largest law offices: the one within the embattled company.  \"We've always regarded them as one of the big law firms in Houston,\" said Howard Ayers, managing partner of Andrews & Kurth, one of the city's largest firms with about 240 lawyers in Houston alone.  Enron has about 245 lawyers worldwide, company spokesman Vance Meyer said. That's a large legal stable even for a company with more than 25,000 employees. With about 145 lawyers in Houston, if it were a private firm it would have been the city's sixth-largest, according to the Chronicle 100 survey released in May.  Energy trader Enron's internal law office has burgeoned along with the huge trading firm, now set to merge with a smaller but stronger local competitor, Dynegy. As Enron's stock plummeted further, Dynegy last week denied rumors it might drop out and leave Enron to face a possible bankruptcy.  Whatever the company's fate, there are rough waters ahead for Enron lawyers.  Although most lawyers interviewed said they hope everybody remains employed and that it is premature to discuss the fate of Enron's legal staff, speculation in the legal community runs the gamut from rumors that dozens of lawyers could be laid off as early as this week to the idea that Enron will hold on tightly to its talent.  \"My guess is they'll need their lawyers while they get things in a more steady state. There's a lot of legal work to go through,\" said Joel Swanson, a senior partner at Baker & Botts, a Houston law firm with about 265 lawyers here.  Not only does Enron have a large cadre of lawyers inside its company, but it also has hired just about every large firm in Houston over the last few years. Several of the biggest Houston firms are working on the merger for either Enron or Dynegy, and others are standing by wondering which outside firms will get the biggest pieces of legal work when the new company is created.  Enron's legal department has siphoned talent from Houston's top law firms over the years. Heads of law firms said they have seen plenty of promising lawyers lured away by Enron's competitive pay combined with stock options, which were a lucrative draw until recently, as shares have lost 95 percent of their value.  \"Enron has one of the premier legal departments in the country,\" said Jeff Love, managing partner of Locke Liddell & Sapp, a Houston-based firm with about 175 of its lawyers here.  Enron has hired a lot of what are called \"laterals,\" or lawyers who have had a couple years training, often at a big firm.  Although jobs in corporate counsel offices are generally considered easier than big-firm life, that's not the reputation of Enron's legal eagles.  As with the company itself, the general counsel's office has been known as innovative and hard driving.  \"I don't think anybody lateraled into Enron with the expectation of an ordinary life,\" Ayers said.  In the Houston market, where big-firm first-year lawyers start at around $110,000 a year, the advantages of going to an expanding company like Enron were the stock options and the opportunity to grow with the company.  If heavily anticipated layoffs occur at Enron, top Houston lawyers expect casualties to land on their feet. Looming recessions are not always bad for job-hunting lawyers. Bankruptcy, litigation and mergers all can boom in rough times.  Several Houston-based law firms said they have recruited a slightly larger starting class of lawyers for 2002, meaning they don't expect to scale back their business in the immediate future.  Should the merger succeed, Enron's 245 lawyers will join Dynegy's 43.  \"The question of how you integrate the two staffs, as with a lot of things associated with the merger, won't be worked out for some time,\" Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel said.   Nov. 27, 2001 Houston Chronicle Bin Laden threat against pipelines taken seriously  Ashcroft: Unconfirmed warning linked to leader's death, capture  By MICHAEL DAVIS  Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle  The FBI confirmed Monday that it has warned the energy industry that Osama bin Laden may have ordered strikes against U.S. natural gas facilities if he is caught or killed.  The agency issued the warning last week, Attorney General John Ashcroft said at a news conference Monday. It had uncorroborated information that bin Laden may have approved plans for such attacks, Ashcroft added.  The FBI warning said \"such an attack would allegedly take place in the event that either bin Laden or Taliban leader Mullah Omar are either captured or killed.\"  The warning hit home in Houston because while the warning did not single out a target, it referred specifically to natural gas infrastructure, such as pipelines. Houston is the hub of this industry and is at the center of a dense web of gas pipelines.  The warning was considered similar to the one issued earlier about potential attacks against West Coast bridges.  Ashcroft said the government is in regular communication with companies that own the nation's energy infrastructure, such as refineries, natural gas pipelines and nuclear plants.  Federal law enforcement officials received the uncorroborated report of undetermined reliability about a potential attack against natural gas supplies about 10 days ago, Ashcroft said.  Since the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, all energy companies have established more stringent security measures. Pipelines, however, are considered especially vulnerable since they are accessible above ground in remote areas with typically little more than a padlock and a metal fence to keep out someone wanting to damage the line.  Reliant Energy Entex, the natural gas distribution company that serves the Houston area, was notified about the warning but has not added any new security measures as a result, company spokeswoman Alicia Dixon said.  \"We've been on a heightened state of alert since Sept. 11 so nothing is different today than it was yesterday,\" Dixon said. \"We have very strong security in place already because of the nature of our business. We have to be prepared to deal with a variety of emergencies.\"  Dixon said the company recieved word of the warning from the American Gas Association. The American Petroleum Institute also passed the warning on to energy companies, API spokesman Juan Palomo said.  Enron notified its employees of the warning and also has been on heightened state of alert since Sept. 11, company spokeswoman Gina Taylor said.  \"We take all threats seriously,\" Taylor said.  Enron monitors its pipelines and related facilities such as compression stations using planes, cars and on foot, she said. The company has not added staff to beef up its security as a result of the warning, she said.  \"We routinely patrol the right of way,\" she said.  There are thousands of miles of natural gas pipelines running throughout the nation. Thirty interstate gas pipelines carry 90 percent of the natural gas transported, according to the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America.  Detailed information about locations of pipelines and other energy infrastructure has been taken off some corporate and government Internet sites. Access to facilities has been tightened as well, officials said.  Federal regulators have offered help to pay for the added protection by speeding rate hike requests for beefed-up security.  If a pipeline were attacked with an explosive, for example, the operator could shut off the flow of natural gas, oil or refined products from either side of the break.     Nov. 27, 2001 Houston Chronicle Current recession differs from others  By JIM BARLOW  Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle  So it's official. The United States is in a recession.  That was the word Monday from the National Bureau of Economic Research. A recession, by the by, comes about after six months of declining economic activity. In this case, the bureau said, the recession started last March, so we're already through almost nine months of slowdown.  But there's something very different about this recession, different from all the others we've experienced in the past four or five decades. We were not led into it by a huge oversupply of all kinds of real estate and a collapse in those prices.  The current recession was sparked by a high-tech collapse, led by a glut of technology products.  That doesn't mean real estate will sail through untouched this recession. There are places that will be hurting. San Francisco comes to mind. It is a high-tech center, and there was a lot of building to accommodate that industry.  There is also one real estate sector in trouble -- the hotel industry. It had already been hurt by a downturn in business travel. The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks sent it, and air travel, reeling.  Recall see-through buildings? But there's nothing like we saw back in the mid-1980s. Remember when Houston enriched the nation's vocabulary by coming up with the term see-through buildings? Those were the many skyscrapers in Houston that had been built but never finished inside. So you could look right through them because there were no interior walls.  Indeed, if real estate is a bright spot in this recession, real estate in Houston is a great shining light.  Houston's office building market is tight. The downtown office market has an 8.9 percent vacancy rate, and prime Class A space prized by major corporations is effectively full. There should be some easing of that rate. Enron Corp., with its well-publicized freefall, has almost completed a new headquarters. Even more space will be coming onto the market when the 32-story Calpine Center office tower is completed at 717 Texas Ave. in 2003.  Century Development has announced it is working on a 40-story office tower downtown. Crescent Real Estate Equities is building a tower on the other side of Main Street. All this, plus cutbacks at Continental Airlines and the pending sale of Compaq Computer Corp. to Hewlett-Packard Co., will doubtless hurt the office market. But no one is predicting disaster.  The Houston apartment market may be the nation's healthiest, with 93.5 percent of Houston's apartments occupied in the third quarter of this year. That figure is almost a full percentage point higher than the year before. Prices for apartments are up, as are rents.  Sales of used homes in October were the highest ever, with the median price up 3.9 percent. New-home sales are setting records.  Developers are optimists So how did we escape the usual? Credit lenders.  Real estate developing is full of optimists. Ask any developer -- even in the midst of a bust -- and he'll tell you. It won't affect his building, which somehow is nicer, sexier or even more depression-proof than the next guy's. Give a developer money, and he will build.  Lenders have been as tight as the bark on trees. That has forced developers to pre-lease buildings and seek partners with equity -- primarily pension funds -- before the banks would loan them money for new projects.  Several things happen to the real estate business during a recession. Prices fall or stabilize -- and in this particular recession the bet is probably on stabilization. The banks and others that loan that money generally tighten credit standards, cutting off weaker real estate players. And the Federal Reserve Board helps out the economy by lowering rates, which aids bargain hunters with deep pockets.  In any recession, even one that is as benign to real estate as this one, some properties won't survive the economic downturn and owners will have to sell or file for bankruptcy.  With the current low interest rates, companies with good credit will move in and buy those properties. Remember the so-called vulture funds of the 1980s?  How soon this process starts will determine the length of this recession. Because real estate is in good shape this time, the process is not as important as it was in the 1980s. Still, if investors promptly snap up distressed properties, that will increase the odds that this recession will be a short one.     Enron Gains on Optimism Dynegy Purchase to Proceed (Update1) 2001-11-27 07:59 (New York)       (Updates to add Instinet trading, comment by Tice.)       Houston, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. shares rose as much as 3.5 percent on Instinet amid optimism Dynegy Inc. will proceed with its proposed acquisition of the rival U.S. energy trader after renegotiating the terms of its offer.       Shares of the energy trader plunged 55 percent last week on concern the merger would unravel after Enron said it had more debt and less cash than previously announced, threatening its ability to operate until Dynegy completes the purchase.       Executives of the two companies discussed possible changes in the terms over the weekend, people familiar with the matter said yesterday. Dynegy is now talking about paying less than 0.15 shares for each of Enron's, valuing the company's equity at about $5 billion, or less than $6 per share, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people close to the discussions.       ``The choices are fairly stark: Renegotiate the deal or file for Chapter 11,'' said John Olson, an analyst with Sanders Morris Harris, a Houston-based financial services company.       Enron shares rose as much as 14 cents to $4.15 on Instinet. The original Dynegy bid valued Enron at $10.54 a share in Dynegy stock. The discount reflects skepticism among investors the acquisition will be completed under the original terms.       Bond investors were less optimistic. The company's 6.4 percent bonds that mature in 2006 declined to 45 cents on the dollar from 48 cents on the dollar yesterday, traders said. At that price, the bonds yield 28.5 percent.       ``The concern is that the Dynegy deal breaks down,'' said Paul Tice, co-head of U.S. high-grade credit research who covers the energy market for Deutsche Bank. Last week's Securities and Exchange Commission filing ``had a lot of negative surprises.''       Investors have become concerned because Enron hasn't been able to complete a proposal to raise $2 billion through a private equity sale and Moody's Investors Service is weighing whether to downgrade the company's credit rating.                             Extension?       The companies may announce as early as today an extension by some banks on the repayment of Enron's debt, a $500 million cash infusion from Citigroup Inc. and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., and an agreement that would keep the purchase intact despite lawsuits over Enron's employee-retirement plan, the New York Times said.       Neither Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne nor Dynegy spokesman John Sousa would comment on whether talks on a new buyout agreement are underway.       Current terms call for an exchange ratio of 0.2685 share of Dynegy stock for each Enron share. Given recent disclosures about Enron's debt and the drop in the stock price, a fairer ratio would be 0.15 share of Dynegy, said Ronald Barone, a UBS Warburg analyst who rates Dynegy a ``strong buy.''       ``If they can renegotiate the deal to half (the original price), that's where you get really attractive earnings,'' said Gordon Howald, an analyst at Credit Lyonnais who rates Dynegy a ``buy.''                           Enron's Debt      Under current terms, the deal makes sense for Dynegy only if Enron earns 85 cents or more, Howald said. Barone has reduced his estimate of Enron's 2002 earnings from $1.65 a share to 75 cents.       Dynegy shares fell $1.15, or 2.9 percent, to $39.25 yesterday.        New terms may not be necessary if Enron can get the additional $2 billion in financing it's seeking, some investors said.       ``If people who've looked at Enron are willing to put in that kind of money, it sends a message that their core businesses -- trading, pipelines and energy management -- are still sound,'' said Kathleen Vuchetich, who helps manage $1.4 billion in assets in the Strong Utilities Fund, 4.3 percent of which is Dynegy stock.      Enron has debt payments of more than $9 billion due before the end of 2002, and has less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines left, the company said in a filing last week. If its cash reserves run too low, Enron's credit rating may be cut below investment grade. That would trigger $3.9 billion in debt repayments for two affiliated partnerships.                             Reprieve       Moody's Investors Service hasn't issued a report on Enron since the company filed a 10-Q quarterly report with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week. On Nov. 9, it rated Enron's debt one notch above junk. The rating company's analysts didn't return calls seeking comment.       Egan-Jones Ratings Co. lowered its rating on Enron's credit today to ``BB-'' from ``BB,'' a level below investment grade.      The Houston-based company also said in the filing that it had a $690 million note due this week, and that it may have to reduce fourth-quarter earnings by $700 million. The write-off would come because it used stock to guarantee debt owed by an affiliated partnership, and the value of that stock has plunged.       On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on the $690 million note and closed on a $450 million credit line. Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watson said he was ``encouraged'' by the developments.       Enron is negotiating to restructure its other debt, Denne said yesterday. J.P. Morgan and Citigroup executives met today to line up investors willing to buy $2 billion in bonds convertible into Enron stock.

Workers sue over shrinking 401(k)s. THOMAS S. MULLIGAN TIMES STAFF WRITER  11/27/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition C-1 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company  NEW YORK -- Enron Corp. shares Monday sank to a low not seen since the 1987 stock market crash, as investors continued to mark down the chances of the energy trader's completing its pending buyout by rival Dynegy Inc.  Enron stock tumbled 70 cents, or 15%, to $4.01 on the New York Stock Exchange. Dynegy fell $1.15, or 3%, to $39.25 on the Big Board. The pressure on Enron is mounting not just from Wall Street but from regulators, bond-rating agencies, the energy trading community and Enron's own employees, many of them angered by the devastation of their retirement accounts as the company's stock has plunged 95% this year.  An employee lawsuit was filed Monday in federal court in Houston, alleging that Enron misled workers about its profitability and breached its fiduciary duty by inducing them to buy company stock for their 401(k) retirement plans.  About 15,000 Enron employees are owed a total of $890 million in compensation for losses sustained in their retirement accounts, said Eli Gottesdiener, whose Washington firm represents the plaintiffs.  One of the plaintiffs, Gary Kemper, a maintenance foreman with Enron's Portland General Electric unit in Oregon, said the total value of his 401(k) account has shrunk to $129,000 from $317,000 this year as his Enron holdings collapsed to about $9,000 from $197,000.  \"It wouldn't tick me off so bad except that they were sending us e-mail after e-mail [last summer] saying things are fine,\" Kemper said in an interview Monday, referring to company executives. \"Of course, we find out later that they were dumping their own stock, millions of dollars at a time.\"  Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay cashed in stock and options worth $123 million last year, when the stock was near its peak.  Kemper and his wife had been planning to retire early, four years from now, but it is no longer clear that they will be able to afford it, he said.  Another law firm representing Enron employees, Seattle-based Hagens Berman, is looking into the possibility of adding Enron's accounting firm as a defendant, partner Karl Barth said Monday.  The accountant, Andersen, has been criticized for failing to catch irregularities that caused Enron to restate its earnings dating back to 1997 and declare its previous financial reports unreliable.  Egan-Jones Ratings Co., a credit-rating agency in suburban Philadelphia, on Monday cut its rating on Enron's senior debt by one notch, saying the company will need $1 billion to $1.5 billion in the next 45 days to fund operating losses and other liabilities.  Egan-Jones dropped Enron's bonds to the sub-investment-grade, or junk, level in August, about when the company's chief executive, Jeffrey K. Skilling, abruptly resigned. The agency's view is more severe than those of larger rivals Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's, which both continue to keep Enron's debt in the investment-grade category.  Sean Egan, a managing director of Egan-Jones, said he views the chances of the merger going through at less than 50-50. And if the merger falls through, Enron's chances of survival are not very high, he said.  Dynegy has kept mum about the deal since Wednesday, when it said it was trying to speed regulatory approvals. Wall Street analysts have noted that Dynegy could invoke terms of a \"material adverse change\" clause allowing it to modify or walk away from the deal if it determines that Enron's condition is markedly worse than it was when the deal was struck Nov. 9.  Under the merger deal, Enron shareholders would receive 0.2685 Dynegy share for each of their shares. That implied a value of $10.54 a share, more than double Enron's closing price Monday. The gap indicates Wall Street's doubts about whether the deal will get done.  Elsewhere Monday, the office of California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer reiterated that it will scrutinize the Dynegy-Enron merger on antitrust grounds.  Analysts say California could use its power to delay the deal as a way to squeeze Dynegy for better prices on long-term power contracts it negotiated during the height of the state's energy crisis this year.  Enron already is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission over controversial deals involving limited partnerships organized and run by former company executives.

Attorney Gen'l to examine Dynegy-Enron deal.  11/26/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001.  SACRAMENTO, Calif., Nov 26 (Reuters) - California's attorney general will examine Dynegy Inc.'s bid to buy its much larger energy rival, Enron Corp. , officials said Monday, adding a potential new wrinkle to the troubled $9 billion merger proposal.  \"We are reviewing the merger for anti-trust concerns,\" said Sandra Michioku, spokeswoman for Attorney General Bill Lockyer. Michioku said it was still far too early to say what position California would take on the proposed merger, which involves two companies often publicly blamed for helping to create California's energy crisis this year.  Dynegy was among five energy companies named in a lawsuit filed in May by Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante alleging energy price manipulation at several southern California power plants it owns. Dynegy has denied the accusation.  Enron, while owning no generation plants in California, is a major national player for energy trading and natural gas transmission - which if merged with Dynegy's market presence in the state could create a major new energy powerhouse.  The proposed merger, which has been plagued by uncertainty amid news of major new Enron debt and a resulting slump in its share price, is already being examined by the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  California regulators could present a roadblock to successful completion of the deal. But the state could also leverage its influence over the merger to renegotiate a number of long-term energy deals with Dynegy, which it signed months ago at the height of its power crisis and which are now being criticized as a bad deal for the state's consumers.  Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.     Dynegy May Modify Enron Purchase Terms, People Say (Update2) 2001-11-27 00:23 (New York)  Dynegy May Modify Enron Purchase Terms, People Say (Update2)       (Adds reports on stock ratio and bank extensions in seventh and eighth paragraphs.)       Houston, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Dynegy Inc. may renegotiate terms of its proposed $22.9 billion purchase of Enron Corp., whose shares have fallen 54 percent since the merger was announced, people familiar with talks between the companies said.       Executives of the two energy-trading companies discussed possible changes in the terms over the weekend, the people said. The offer made on Nov. 9 values Enron at $10.54 a share in Dynegy stock. Enron's stock closed at $4.01, indicating investors don't believe the sale will be completed under the original terms.       Enron is seeking as much as $2 billion in equity investment and Moody's Investors Service is weighing whether to downgrade the credit rating of the energy trader, which said last week its debt was higher than earlier reported. Enron needs to offer more attractive terms or risk losing the support of Dynegy investors for a deal needed to save the company, analysts said.       ``The choices are fairly stark: Renegotiate the deal or file for Chapter 11,'' said John Olson, an analyst with Sanders Morris Harris.       Neither Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne nor Dynegy spokesman John Sousa would comment on whether talks on a new buyout agreement are underway.       Current terms call for an exchange ratio of 0.2685 share of Dynegy stock for each Enron share. Given recent disclosures about Enron's debt and the drop in the stock price, a fairer ratio would be 0.15 share of Dynegy, said Ronald Barone, a UBS Warburg analyst who rates Dynegy a ``strong buy.''                              Half Price?       Enron and Dynegy are talking about cutting the ratio to less than 0.15, which would value the stock portion of the transaction at about $5 billion, or less than $6 per Enron share, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people close to the discussions.       In addition, the companies may announce as early as today an extension by some banks on the repayment of Enron's debt, a $500 million cash infusion from Citigroup Inc. and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., and an agreement that would keep the purchase intact despite lawsuits over Enron's employee-retirement plan, the New York Times said.       ``If they can renegotiate the deal to half (the original price), that's where you get really attractive earnings,'' said Gordon Howald, an analyst at Credit Lyonnais who rates Dynegy a ``buy.''      Under current terms, the deal makes sense for Dynegy only if Enron earns 85 cents or more, Howald said. Barone has reduced his estimate of Enron's 2002 earnings from $1.65 a share to 75 cents.      Dynegy shares fell $1.15, or 2.9 percent, to $39.25.                         Additional Financing       New terms may not be necessary if Enron can get the additional $2 billion in financing it's seeking, some investors said.       ``If people who've looked at Enron are willing to put in that kind of money, it sends a message that their core businesses -- trading, pipelines and energy management -- are still sound,'' said Kathleen Vuchetich, who helps manage $1.4 billion in assets in the Strong Utilities Fund, 4.3 percent of which is Dynegy stock.      Enron has debt payments of more than $9 billion due before the end of 2002, and has less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines left, the company said in a filing last week. If its cash reserves run too low, Enron's credit rating may be cut below investment grade. That would trigger $3.9 billion in debt repayments for two affiliated partnerships.       Moody's Investors Service hasn't issued a report on Enron since the company filed a 10-Q quarterly report with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week. On Nov. 9, it rated Enron's debt one notch above junk. The rating company's analysts didn't return calls seeking comment today.       Egan-Jones Ratings Co. lowered its rating on Enron's credit today to ``BB-'' from ``BB,'' a level below investment grade.                               Write-Off       The Houston-based company also said in the filing that it had a $690 million note due this week, and that it may have to reduce fourth-quarter earnings by $700 million. The write-off would come because it used stock to guarantee debt owed by an affiliated partnership, and the value of that stock has plunged.       On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on the $690 million note and closed on a $450 million credit line. Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watson said he was ``encouraged'' by the developments.       Enron is negotiating to restructure its other debt, Denne said today. J.P. Morgan and Citigroup executives met today to line up investors willing to buy $2 billion in bonds convertible into Enron stock.       Many of Enron's trading partners are shunning the company, and some analysts now say Enron's 2002 earnings may hurt, rather than boost, Dynegy's earnings, as Watson has projected.                          Deteriorating Daily       ``The value of the assets Dynegy is trying to buy -- the trading and marketing businesses -- are deteriorating on a daily basis as more counterparties back off on trading and dealing with Enron,'' said Mike Heim, a securities analyst at A.G.

The suit was filed in Houston by Gary Kemper, a 57-year-old maintenance foreman at an Enron affiliate, and seeks to recover $850 million in losses, said his attorney, Eli Gottesdiener. The suit claims Enron prevented employees under the age of 50 from selling stock they received from the company as 401(k) matching contributions.       Houston-based Enron, whose bond and stock prices fell amid concern Dynegy Inc. may abandon its $23 billion proposed bid for the company, faces at least two other lawsuits seeking to recover losses from employee 401(k) accounts. The previous suits did not raise the prospectus claim.       Enron shares fell 70 cents to $4.01 after trading as low as $3.76 today. They've dropped 95 percent this year. Company spokeswoman Karen Denne declined to comment on the suit, citing the company's policy on pending litigation.  --Vivien Lou Chen in San Francisco, (415) 743-3506   Enron Plunges, but Dynegy Will Suffer, Too By Peter Eavis <mailto:peavis@thestreet.com> Senior Columnist TheStreet.com 11/26/2001 06:54 PM EST URL: <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/detox/10004469.html>  In the Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) endgame, both players look set to lose.  The other player is energy trader Dynegy (DYN:NYSE - news - commentary) , which this month agreed to buy Enron. Since the deal was announced, Enron's fundamentals have rapidly deteriorated, making Dynegy's offer look ridiculously generous. But even if the deal gets done at more advantageous terms, Dynegy will struggle to revive a disembowled Enron and absorb its hefty debt load.  Making matters worse, Dynegy could suffer just as much if it backs out of the deal. Without a merger, Houston-based Enron almost certainly goes to the wall, causing disruption, stress and profit-sapping change in the energy market. How can Dynegy not get wounded in that environment? The stock market doesn't seem to agree, however; Dynegy shares remain above their predeal levels.  Wishful Thinking A Dynegy spokesman says his company can post annual earnings growth of 20% to 25% over the next two years even without Enron. He declined to comment on the merger negotiations, except to say that Dynegy is \"continuing its due diligence\" of Enron. An Enron spokesman declined to comment on deal talks.  Where do things stand as of Monday evening? Well, the deal looks increasingly unlikely to happen (at least on the terms of Nov. 9). After a sickening slide last week, Enron tanked again Monday, dropping 15% to $4.01. Current deal terms have Dynegy paying around $10.50 an Enron share based on its current stock price. A 60% gap says the deal won't get done. But, as the world and his wife now know, the deal needs to go through for Enron to maintain the investment grade credit rating necessary for its survival.  Clearly, every hour counts in this fast-unwinding situation. Enron's core trading business is in deep trouble as power market players cut exposure to the company, draining it of precious cash.  As a result, two options exist from here. The first is a rescue effort involving Dynegy, the rating agencies and bank creditors like J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup, working to revise the merger agreement and find more cash to buy Enron time. This could involve changing the stock-swap ratio to give Dynegy a cheaper price, with the banks possibly extending debt and joining with other investors to inject equity.  The other scenario has Dynegy, after seeing the cash hemorrhage and the skeletons in the closet, deciding to back out altogether, leaving Enron with no rescuer and no future. But Dynegy's resilient stock price suggests that the market hasn't grasped the impact an Enron bankruptcy would have on Dynegy and other trading firms.  Don't be at all surprised if, any moment now, we see one last attempt to salvage Dynegy's rescue merger with new terms. Several banks are exposed to Enron and, presumably, they will try almost anything -- including extending debt -- to keep the company afloat. By keeping deeply distressed Enron at an investment-grade rating, rating agencies such as Moody's have shown themselves willing to bend to the banks' wishes, so they will probably capitulate again if pressured by bank honchos.  Be Careful What You Wish For But swallowing Enron would hardly be good for Dynegy, which appears to have underestimated the former's problems.  Amazingly, just a couple of weeks back, the company expected Enron to make $1.50 per share in 2002. Goldman Sachs is now expecting 50 cents, even if the merger gets done. If Dynegy ended up paying, say, $3 a share for Enron, people would no doubt hail that as a low-enough price to cover worsened fundamentals, legal liabilities and any nasty surprises that could spring from Enron's notoriously murky books. But recall that Dynegy also would be taking on Enron's $13 billion of debt. Include the debt in some return-on-capital calculations and the deal still looks untenable.  Alternatively, Enron may be deteriorating too fast to save. That's also bad for Dynegy. The damage done to the company by depleted energy market activity has been recognized, as has the risk that an Enron collapse could leave Dynegy dangerously unhedged on many of its trades. What does that mean and why is it dangerous? Let's say Dynegy agreed to buy power from Company X over a period of time and then sell it to Enron. If Enron goes down, its obligation to buy from Dynegy obviously disappears, but Dynegy can't easily back out of the commitment to buy power from Company X.  And there's another potential risk that the market really hasn't recognized. Enron allegedly was very aggressive in booking upfront profits on forward market deals. An Enron spokesman declined to comment on that allegation. Those deals had to be done with other trading houses, possibly Dynegy.  In other words, Enron's ways may have contaminated the whole market because, as we are frequently told, Enron was the energy market, just as Drexel Burnham was the junk bond market in the '80s. In Enron's absence, many of the aggressive deals may have to be unwound. Meanwhile, auditors, in a frantic bid to cover their behinds, would start telling trading companies to be a lot more conservative in how much profit they book on forward deals. Suddenly, fat margin deals evaporate and earnings estimates get slashed.  Checkmate -- for both sides.   IN THE MONEY: Another Sign Investors Don't Trust Enron  11/27/2001  Dow Jones News Service  (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)    (This column was first published Monday)       By Michael Rapoport     A Dow Jones Newswires Column      NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- If you needed any further proof that investors no longer trust Enron Corp. (ENE), here's another piece of evidence - one that goes to the heart of the recent plunge in the company's stock.  Enron doesn't simply trade for less than its book value; it fell below that milestone weeks ago. No, now it trades for less than ONE-THIRD of its book value.  That's a rare level for a company of Enron's size and prominence. And it may mean, among other things, that investors have decided that they simply can't place any further faith in the veracity of Enron's earnings and balance-sheet figures, much-revised as they've been - something that has unnerving implications for any attempt to value the company fairly.  First, let's be clear about what this means. Enron stock is currently about $4 a share; the company's reported book value is about $12.90 a share. In other words, Enron stock sells for less than one-third of what shareholders would get if the company were to liquidate - were to turn all its assets into cash, pay off all its liabilities on its balance sheet and give what's left over to shareholders.  This is an uncommonly dismal level for any company, even a troubled one. For comparison's sake, Dynegy Inc. (DYN), which has agreed to buy Enron, trades at about three times book value, as does El Paso Corp. (EPG), a competitor of both companies. In fact, Enron has the second-lowest price-to-book ratio of any company in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index - only Conseco Inc. (CNC), another troubled company, is lower, by an eyelash.  Part of the problem is undoubtedly the continuing fear among investors that Dynegy's agreement to buy Enron will fall apart, and the belief that Enron will have to file for bankruptcy if it does, in which case Enron shareholders would be hard-pressed to realize any value. The Dynegy deal now amounts to about $10.60 per Enron share, itself well under Enron's book value; the huge premium that level offers over Enron's current stock price is an indication of the big risk investors see that the deal won't be consummated in its current form.  But given Enron's current woes, it's certainly also possible that Enron is trading at such a big discount to book value because investors don't feel they can trust the earnings and balance-sheet numbers coming out of Enron. Those numbers, after all, are the raw material that form the basis for valuing Enron, or any other company, by computing figures like price-to-book and price-to-earnings ratios.  And the Enron debacle has been all about the quality of those numbers, with Enron shifting assets off its balance sheet to outside limited partnerships from which some of its executives benefitted. In terms of those numbers, the ground has shifted underneath investors three separate times now - when the company slashed its reported shareholder equity by $1.2 billion to unwind its transactions with one of those partnerships, when it restated nearly five years' worth of earnings downward by a total of $586 million, and when it revealed that it could take further charges and was facing an imminent deadline to post collateral on a $690 million note. (That deadline has now been extended until Dec. 14.)  When you've gotten punched in the face three times, it's not unreasonable to fear there'll be a fourth blow, no matter how much the puncher assures you there won't be. Given Enron's insanely complicated structure, and the way bad financial news has dribbled out of the company over the past several weeks, who can guarantee there aren't more such shocks yet to come?  That's what investors appear to be fearing, and that may be part of the reason Enron stock has fallen so precipitously. Thanks to Enron's repeated demonstrations that its numbers can't be relied on, investors no longer have a firm, trustworthy basis on which to value the stock. And so, not surprisingly, the value is getting ratcheted down to the most conservative, bare-minimum level.  An Enron spokesman couldn't be reached for comment.  It's ironic, in a way. For a long time, it was hard to properly value Enron because its structure and finances were so complex and hard to decipher. Now it's hard to properly value Enron because the company's attempts to clarify its finances have made it clear that it's hard to expect investors to trust in their accuracy.  -By Michael Rapoport, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5976; michael.rapoport@dowjones.com   ",

I also went out into PGAS and confirmed the volume measured was indeed 96.7 dth.  Apparently we have an issue between PGAS and the TMS system.  I will get with Harry, the PGAS group, and the TMS in the morning to see if we can figure out what is going on.  So please disregard the Bushton Report for the 26th.  Randy",

I thought Order 637 was supposed to rid pipeline tariffs of unnecessary penalties.  I don't know what \"non-critical\" means as applied to our post-637 tariff.  para 61 - I can't tell if the new rule is applicable only to releases implemented after the effective date, or will it also apply to existing recallable releases that do not have a condition precluding intra-day recalls.  Ordinarily, we could try to use our compliance filing to clarify such things but here FERC has dictated the tariff language we have to use.  We haven't decided whether to seek clarification.  Our business folks are still looking at this.  >>> <Nancy.Bagot@dynegy.com> 03/15/02 04:03PM >>>  I'm wondering if anyone has discussed or thought about filing for rehearing or clarification on this rule (which would be due April 10, I believe). - Nancy Bagot Northern Natural  =================== Nancy Bagot Manager, Govt.

The sign-up sheet is located outside Ricki's workstation (4268A).   The buffet will be set up in 42C1 (the gas control presentation room).  Room 42C2 is also reserved for seating.    Following our luncheon, we will have a Gas Logistics staff meeting at 1 PM in 39C1.  We can discuss any Enron updates and I will do my best to address any questions and concerns that you have.      At the end of our staff meeting, we'll hold our holiday raffle drawing.   We have lots of fun prizes, including many sets of sports tickets.  All Gas Logistics employee names will be entered.  You need not be present to win.  Finally, I want to fill you in on my upcoming journey.  My husband and I have been trying to adopt a young girl from Kazakhstan into our family.  The paperwork and red tape have seemed unending and I was having doubts whether it would ever happen.  Early this week I received the call that I need to travel to Kazakhstan next week to pick her up.  While I am excited to complete the adoption, I'm not terribly thrilled with the timing of being gone over the holidays and away from work at this time.  At our staff meeting, I can address any questions you have about whom to call in my absence.  I'm looking forward to our get together next week.  To the extent that you aren't able to make the luncheon, let me take this opportunity to wish you and your family a happy, safe and relaxing holiday season.  ",

Under this arrangement, Maintenance of Houston provides an on-site janitor.   In our initial correspondence soliciting janitorial service bids, we explained that our facility is used as a school during the week.  We explained the importance from a security perspective of minimizing the number of different people that have access to the facility.  We also asked Maintenance of Houston to provide documentation of employee screening procedures.   It has recently come to our attention that Maintenance of Houston has not furnished employee screening documentation for the individual that Maintenance of Houston currently has assigned to our facility.  It is our policy to request criminal background information for any contractor that is in our facility during school hours.   Please furnish such employee screening information to us by April 30, 2001.  To the extent Maintenance of Houston is unable to provide documentation for the current individual assigned to our facility or furnish another individual that does have appropriate documentation by April 30, 2001, we are hereby providing notice of our intent to terminate the month to month agreement effective May 31, 2001.

		"_body" : "            We met with SoCal today to discuss the changes SoCal is making for  November 1.  Here is a high level recap in relation to impacts on TW:   1.  SoCal will NOT set the capacity at needles lower than 750 unless       they have operational problems. And they will maintain 750 for a gas        day (during all cycles).  (Good news for TW)   2.  SoCal may set a capacity higher than 750.  If they do, they will       maintain that capacity for a gas day (during all cycles), unless there       are specific operational problems. (Good news for TW)       4.  SoCal will have the option to call OFO's at the beginning of each cycle       for the gas day, which could cause a confirmation reduction.  Today they       only call an OFO before the gas day begins.   Starting Nov. 1, they can        call an OFO anytime before a GISB cycle, including Intraday 1 and        Intraday 2 which are cycles in the gas day. (This will be a major impact       to SoCal's customers)   5.  SoCal says the \"windowing\" is gone.  But, they are still giving us a       capacity and TW will continue to do the allocation if nominations       exceed their capacity.   6.  SoCal can still reduce the scheduled volumes after an allocation.  This       would be due to SoCal's market not burning their schedule.  At that       time SoCal will confirm down to the market burn.   Overall, our process does not change. If you have any questions, please  let me know.  Thanks. Lynn   ",

Bay on an EOTT facility.   - Have 2 people on blocks but they are busy with booms (so they are out of communication) and others are on the way to the site to bring up communications. - The spill was initially reported at 10 barrels.  But later received report that slick reported as 250 ft wide x 1.2 mi long.  And it is nearing the bank/shore. - Going to do fly over. - Govt agencies have been called including the Coast Guard. Coast Guard will meet us at site.  - We have deployed US environmental to do containment and cleanup -There is concern that news will cover when slick reaches shore.",

		"_body" : "Steve,  I am most disheartened to hear that Dale Neuner regards my previous  conversation with he and Mark Taylor as the justification for why EOL cannot  accomodate  GPG pipeline capacity transactions.      During the discussion in Mark's office, Dale explained that currently all EOL  users can run reports and see all the details of transactions.  As currently  structured this would mean that any EOL user, including ENA, would be able to  run a report to see detail behind bids on pipeline capacity.  Obviously this  would be a problem under the marketing affiliate rules.  We discussed three  possible ways to address this:  Add security such that ENA/EES users cannot run reports on pipeline bid  data.  I understood leaving the meeting that this might be technically  difficult or expensive. Exclude pipeline data from the reporting feature altogether.  Here the story  was that while this was not necessarily difficult, EOL could not make any  changes before version 2 was ready.  The impression was that this would be  possible after version 2. Erect procedural firewalls.  Mark Taylor suggested that perhaps we could  inform all ENA and EES personnel that the company has a policy that prevents  them from running reports on GPG data.  This probably isn't a good long-run  solution, but we all agreed that it might serve as a bridge measure.  This  approach is supported by the fact that Enron Networks has already entered  into a confidentiality agreement with GPG.  I left the meeting thinking that one or all of these options was feasible and  have not had any correspondence to the contrary since the meeting.     ",

		"_body" : "I know money is tight and I'd like to address our attendance at upcoming GISB Board and Executive Committee meetings.  Per the new NAESB Bylaws, our seats, and therefore voting rights, are dependent on attendance.  Below is the information I know thus far.  The NAESB Bylaws include minimum requirements for meeting attendance of Board and EC members.  The requirements are the same for Board and EC reps.  Members must attend, in person, at least 25% of scheduled meetings and must participate in at least 75% of such meetings.  Attendance will be reviewed each March 31 and September 30 for the preceding twelve months.  The 2002 meeting schedule has not been finalized (neither dates nor locations).  In the past, all Board meetings and most EC meetings have been held in Houston.  For NAESB, this will change.  For 2002, none of the Board meetings will be in Houston and possibly none of the EC meetings will be in Houston.  Starting in June the EC meetings will probably move to two-day meetings (as they were in the past) because more than one quadrant may be in attendance.  New standards will be brought before the EC for vote.  New quadrants will probably have a flurry of new standards -- hopefully not to the extent we had at the beginning of GISB.  Below is the meeting schedule as I know it thus far:  BOARD March 7 --- Washington D.C. June 28 --- TBD Sept 18 --- Baltimore, MD Nov 21 --- TBD  EC Feb 21 --- FP&L in Palm Beach, Florida April 18 --- TBD June 13 --- Boeing in Seattle, WA Aug 8 --- TBD Oct 17 --- Phoenix, AZ (tentative) Dec 12 -- looking for host in New York, NY  The Board still has some transition issues to address, but I think a good deal of the transition has been taken care of.  For a while issues will continue to arise as we move through our processes, such as the one regarding GISB Operating Practices that I mentioned in my last update e-mail.  Activity in the EC slowed almost to a stop due in part to the Order 637 work being done by various subcommittees.  This held up the work on requests.  BPS has only a few requests on their plate.  In January, IR should finalize their work on Order 637 and resume work on their backlog of requests.  ETS has approximately 30 requests submitted to GISB; most are in IR.  One thing to watch for in the EC is standards that spill over into the wholesale gas quadrant from other quadrants.  If a standard is being adopted by another quadrant, EC reps in our quadrant can decide that the standard should apply to our quadrant as well.  The vote needed to have our quadrant address the standard is simple majority, which does not require support by the pipeline segment.  The final adoption of the standard requires a 17/2 vote.  New NAESB procedures may also be raised by other quadrants that affect adoption of standards or the organization as a whole.  These would be addressed by either the Board or the EC, depending on the nature of the procedure.  Thanks, Theresa",

There was discussion of reverting back to 16 day charts but I do not know where that stands.  cvb",

Earlier Tuesday, a report in The Wall Street Journal quoted people familiar with the matter who said Enron and Dynegy were in advanced discussions to cut the price of the all-stock transaction by more than 40% to about $5 billion. Sousa, the Dynegy spokesman, didn't comment on the newspaper report.   Dynegy shares recently traded at $40, up 75 cents, or 1.9%, while Enron shares changed hands at $3.94, down 7 cents, or 1.7%.   Under the original terms of the transaction, Enron shareholders are to receive 0.2685 of a Dynegy share, or $10.78, for each share outstanding, or about $9.14 billion, based on Dynegy's recent stock price.   According to the Journal report, the new terms could be below 0.15 of a Dynegy share.   The deal is critical for Enron, which also simultaneously carrying out talks to receive between $500 million to $1 billion in additional funding to support its operations, while carrying on negotiations to restructure its debt, which totals about $13 billion.   While Dynegy has already provided Enron with a cash infusion, it is uncertain how long Enron's current funds will allow it to remain solvent.   Meanwhile, a third employee lawsuit has been filed against Enron over lost 401(k) retirement savings due to the recent collapse of Enron's stock, which has declined more than 90% in the trailing 12 months. The suit claims Enron \"locked down\" the plan, which prevented employees from being able to sell the shares, and seeks $850 million for plan losses.   Although the other recently filed employee suits didn't disclose the amount of compensation the plaintiffs are seeking, it is possible the suits seek a similar level of damages, a CreditSights report said.   If this is true, the CreditSights report said, it is possible the clause that allows Dynegy to walk away from the deal if the liabilities from \"pending\"' or \"threatened\" litigation may exceed $3.5 billion may be invoked.   In addition, to the employee lawsuits, more than a dozen shareholder suits have been filed against Enron.   -By Christina Cheddar, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5166; christina.cheddar@dowjones.com         Dynegy Confirms Talks On Enron Deal Structure - Source  By Christina Cheddar    11/27/2001   Dow Jones News Service   (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)   NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) confirmed the company is in talks with a number of parties regarding the structure of its transaction with Enron Corp. (ENE).   \"I can confirm that we are in discussions with the parties involved in the transaction related to the structure of the deal,\" said John Sousa. \"I can't elaborate any further at this time.\"   An Enron official wasn't immediately to comment.       Enron Fights To Find Near-Term Sellers, But Still Trading  By Mark Golden  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES    11/27/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service  (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) continued to struggle Tuesday to find willing sellers of near-term gas and power in North America, but the one-time market maker was still able to trade on a limited basis, according to market sources.   \"It's not getting any better,\" said one major energy broker.  Many energy trading companies aren't selling to Enron and are only buying from it near-term. These include Aquila Inc. (ILA), Mirant (MIR), Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD) subsidiary Coral Energy, Sempra Energy (SRE), and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's energy trading subsidiary, said the broker. The broker estimated Enron's over-the-counter trading volume to be about 25% of what it was a month ago. Companies are willing to buy from Enron in the spot gas and power markets, because taking delivery on commodity and paying for it a month later poses no credit risk for the buyer.   Some other companies, like Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) and BP PLC. (BP), continue to trade with Enron fairly freely, the broker said. Dynegy has reached an agreement to acquire Enron, though the terms of that deal are being renegotiated. The trading subsidiaries of troubled California utility-holding companies PG&E Corp. (PCG) and Edison International (EIX) also are trading with Enron.   The third and largest group of companies are trading with Enron on a very limited basis to reduce exposure by taking off-setting trades against deals done long ago. These include El Paso Corp. (EPG), Reliant Resources (RRI), Tractebel SA's (B.TRB) U.S. trading unit and regulated utilities, the broker said.   Several energy traders said that both power and gas were being sold at prices lower than Enron was offering.   \"They've been cut off from so many people,\" said one electricity trader.   Enron Says Just Slight Reduction In Transactions     An Enron spokesman said he has seen a slight reduction in transactions but not to 25% of the one-month-ago level.   The notional value of Enron's 30-day rolling average of transactions is $2.8 billion, said Enron spokesman Eric Thode. Thode declined to give volume data for Tuesday or Monday, although the company was giving daily information two weeks ago.   \"We're not doing daily information. We're only speaking in terms of 30-day rolling averages. ... It's not fair to speak in terms of daily because of daily volatility,\" Thode said.   Traders and brokers said they hope Dynegy will offer some kind of guarantee to Enron's trading to restore confidence. But, after Enron's ability to transact took a severe turn for the worse Nov. 20, Dynegy said that the companies must continue to operate independently until their merger is approved and completed.   Energy companies began shying away from Enron over the past month, as concerns about its finances precipitated a 75% drop in its stock price and left its bonds trading at levels typically associated with junk-rated debt.   But Enron saw its ability to trade seriously damaged last week following the late release of its quarterly financial report with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission. For the first time since Enron's troubles began a month ago, energy companies stopped selling to Enron in the spot markets for fear that Enron might not be able to pay its bills as soon as next month based on the quarterly filing.   Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's all rate Enron one notch above speculative grade. Moody's has Enron's ratings on review for a downgrade, and S&P has Enron on negative credit watch. Fitch calls Enron's credit rating \"evolving.\" Enron's ability to do business in the energy markets depends on its maintaining investment-grade ratings.   -By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604; mark.golden@dowjones.com   (John Edmiston in Houston and Jon Kamp in Chicago also contributed to this article.)

Stewart    11/27/2001   Dow Jones News Service   (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)   Of SMARTMONEY.COM        I KNOW IT'S been hard, but if you've been able to divert yourself from the amazing news out of Afghanistan this past week, you may have noticed some important merger stories: trouble in the Compaq Computer (CPQ)- Hewlett-Packard (HWP) deal, Dynegy's (DYN) bid for Enron (ENE), and, on Monday, the announcement of Phillips Petroleum's (P) proposed merger with Conoco (COC) to create the world's sixth-largest oil company.   The Phillips-Conoco merger is an excellent example of what economists call horizontal integration - the merger of two companies in the same business, in this case, oil and gas. As an investor, I love these combinations, even though as a citizen I'm often troubled by antitrust concerns. Investors who engage in what's called merger arbitrage, or risk arbitrage, which gained fame and notoriety in the 1980s, tend to sell stock in the acquiring company, and buy the stock of the company being acquired. Though they're far less conspicuous now, risk arbitrageurs play a prominent role in many hedge funds. The strategy is appealing to many portfolio managers because returns are determined less by overall movement in the market than by the circumstances of particular deals. Successful risk-arbitrage hedge funds typically earn 12% to 20% a year in good markets and bad.   Individual investors can do some risk arbitrage of their own, simply by buying stock in a company being acquired and hoping the deal goes through. Because of the risk that it won't (either because of regulatory hurdles or market reaction), these stocks usually trade at a discount to the acquisition price. But few investors are willing to commit the time and resources to keep up with every twist in these deals, let alone investing in enough of them to have a reasonably diversified portfolio. I know I don't.   Instead, for long-term investors I often recommend buying the stock of the acquiring company. In this latest instance, that would be Phillips. In similar circumstances, I have had good luck buying Exxon after it launched its bid for Mobil to form Exxon Mobil (XOM), and Chevron after it acquired Texaco to become ChevronTexaco (CVX). Their stocks were down on the news, but later recovered handsomely as they began to benefit from cost-cutting and economies of scale, not to mention reduced competition. Even if the deal fails, you aren't stuck owning a stock that was bid up only because a deal was announced. Honeywell (HON) investors will know only too well what I mean. I still consider it outrageous that the European Community blocked General Electric's (GE) acquisition of Honeywell, but when the deal fell through, GE investors were glad they had bought the acquiring company rather than the target.   So far, the Phillips-Conoco deal is unusual in that both stocks rose slightly after the merger was announced, which suggests that other investors have caught on to the same phenomenon I've noticed. But even without a built-in merger premium, I'm enthusiastic about the energy sector. True, oil stocks have dropped further since I last recommended them, before the calamitous events of Sept. 11. With talk of an out-and-out price war breaking out and dire predictions of $10-a-barrel oil, it's no wonder. But it's exactly when prospects in the oil patch look their worst that it's the time to buy these stocks. If there is indeed a global economic recovery next year, as seems ever more likely, oil prices will rise. So I recommend Phillips both as a merger play and as a timely investment in the energy sector.   Which brings me to Enron. I'm glad I warned readers away from this former highflying natural-gas, pipeline and energy-trading concern, since its stock continued to fall precipitously until the takeover bid emerged from Dynegy. This isn't exactly a horizontal merger, since Dynegy isn't a big factor in energy trading, but it will combine the two companies' pipelines and natural-gas holdings. The market reaction to this deal was very unusual, since shares of Dynegy, the acquiring company, jumped 14% on the news. Enron moved up just 7%. This is the opposite of what's supposed to happen, but then, nothing about Enron has been typical. The market seems to be saying that it likes the deal, but doubts it will go through, a prospect enhanced by the large breakup fee Dynegy will enjoy if it's horrified by what it discovers in Enron's still-mysterious books. Personally, I'm sitting this one out, but there may be an arbitrage opportunity in Enron for risk-tolerant investors. If the deal goes through (and I think it will), Enron shareholders will receive 0.2685 share of Dynegy for each share of Enron. That's worth over $11 a share at current prices, yet Enron closed Tuesday at just $7, down 23% after a warning from the company that its falling credit ratings are starting to rattle its financial structure. So while Enron's position is becoming increasingly precarious, this deal could make for a nice return. And it's still potentially a very good bet for Dynegy - one that will add to its natural-gas reserves and vault it into the front ranks of energy traders, assuming it can hold on to Enron's talented but now disgruntled employees. Finally, there's the spectacle of the founding Hewlett and Packard families turning against H-P's proposed acquisition of Compaq on the grounds that proposed economies of scale - read layoffs - run counter to the spirit of the company's founders, who treasured employee loyalty and apparently never fired anyone except for cause. The dissidents acknowledged that they have little or no business and managerial experience themselves, although they are represented on H-P's board. Forgive me if I seem impatient with these beneficiaries of extravagant wealth and trust funds, but this reasoning is absurd. However much we might sympathize with their concern for employee well-being, the directors of a modern corporation must balance employees' needs with those of other constituencies, especially the shareholders. Otherwise, a company will suffer far more dire consequences, including bankruptcy or a forced sale in which far more people will lose their jobs than in any merger-related layoffs. I have already expressed my muted enthusiasm for the proposed H-P-Compaq merger. That the deal was even proposed is a sad commentary on how far the fortunes of these once-great companies have fallen. That said, the merger still makes sense, and it's far better for shareholders than if the companies are forced to continue in their respective downward spirals. I owned both stocks until last week, when I sold my small position in Compaq. I did this primarily to realize a tax loss (more on tax-loss selling next week), but also because I wouldn't want to own it if the deal falls through. I'm holding on to my larger position in H-P. I think the deal will be completed, despite the melodrama of family opposition. Eventually, I believe both stocks will benefit, and patient investors might want to buy one or both companies on any weakness. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---- Reasons for Thankfulness The stunning success of the Northern Alliance and the American military mission in Afghanistan has been an amazing story this past week. Who will soon forget the accounts of newly liberated Afghans digging up their TV sets, casting off their veils and celebrating their freedom from Taliban oppression? The implications of this success are profound, and in my view, extremely positive. Economists are already scaling back their estimates for total cost of this war. Oil prices are plunging. The effect is that of a significant tax cut, and just when the economy needs it. The capture of Osama bin Laden seems only a matter of time, which means the world may soon be a safer place. The promise of greater stability in the Middle East has never seemed more tantalizing.   Is it a paradox that as a calamitous 2001 nears an end, I feel more thankful than I have in years filled with a far greater bounty of peace and prosperity? Perhaps not. I hope this Thanksgiving brings you hope, joy and gratitude for the many blessings that have been bestowed upon us, and that have survived and even flourished in the wake of tragedy.

RPT Dynegy confirms in talks on structure of Enron merger deal    11/27/2001  AFX News  (c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd  (Repeating to clarify lead)   NEW YORK (AFX0 - Dynegy Inc confirmed it is in talks with Enron Corp on the terms of their two week-old acquisition deal.  \"I can confirm that we are in discussions with the parties involved in the transaction related to the structure of a deal,\" Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel said.   Enron declined to comment.   Citing people familiar with the matter, the Wall Street Journal reported today that Enron is in advanced talks with Dynegy to cut the price of the all-stock transaction by more than 40 pct to about 5 bln usd.   Enron is also trying to extend the maturity dates of some of its borrowings to stem a growing liquidity crisis, the Wall Street Journal said.   lwl/gc  Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.        STOCKWATCH Enron slightly higher on hopes for new deal price    11/27/2001  AFX News  (c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd  NEW YORK (AFX) - Shares of Enron Corp were slightly higher in midsession trade on reports that the company is trying to renegotiate the terms of a deal with Dynegy Inc, by cutting the price of the all-stock transaction to 5 bln usd, or 40 pct, from 9 bln usd, dealers said.   At 12.19 pm, amid broad declines in the market, Enron shares were trading up 5 cents at 4.04 usd. Dynegy was up 1.26 usd, or 3.26 pct, at 40.51.  The DJIA was down 111.48 points at 9,871.28. The S&P 500 was down 10.40 points at 1,147.02. The Nasdaq composite was down 20.25 points at 1,920.98.   Earlier, the Wall Street Journal said Enron was in advanced talks with Dynegy in an attempt to salvage their two week-old acquisition deal. The companies are discussing a new price for the all-paper deal, following the sharp fall in Enron's share price of the past few weeks.   Enron had hoped to finalise the deal and make an announcement yesterday that would calm investors -- the shares are trading at a small fraction of their record high last year of 87.50 usd.   As of today, however, the revised deal still has not been formalised.   The current agreement with Dynegy contains a \"material adverse change\" clause, which could be invoked to call the deal off.   As part of its due diligence, Dynegy is examining details of Enron's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, which reportedly contained information it had not received previously.   \"Enron is a black hole, and I don't know how deep the bottom is,\" said Fadel Gheit an analyst at Fahnestock & Co.   Only four weeks ago, Enron's stock was trading at the 8 usd mark, Gheit said, noting that if the Dynegy had done their homework the stock would not have continued to collapse.   \"The market sees this and somebody has to figure out the potential exposure, it could be several billion dollars,\" said Gheit.   If the deal is to go through then the two companies must arrive at a new stock-exchange ratio, said Gheit. Under the current acquisition agreement, Dynegy would exchange 0.2685 share for each Enron share tendered.   According to the Wall Street Journal, the new ratio is expected to be less than 0.15 share of Dynegy stock for every share of Enron stock, which would value Enron at less than 6 usd a share, or about 5 bln usd.   blms/cl/gc  opyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.        IN THE MONEY: Hedge Funds Say Yes To New Enron Terms  By Carol S. Remond    11/27/2001  Dow Jones News Service  (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  A Dow Jones Newswires Column     NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- News that Enron Corp. (ENE) and would-be suitor and savior Dynegy Inc. (DYN) are working to renegotiate their merger agreement has done little to assuage market jitters about Enron's fate.  And so far, even professional arbitrageurs, who normally thrive on placing bets on whether a merger is going to go through, continue for the most part to stay clear of Enron's stock and bonds because of the uncertainty surrounding the once mighty energy trader.   Still, reports that the equity swap ratio offered by Dynegy could be revised down to below 0.15 from 0.2685, has some hedge funds, often willing to take more risks, looking to place trades on the deal.   \"We're trying to figure out a good play,\" said a trader at a New York hedge fund.   So far, bets under consideration seem to be those that would include a combination of stock and debt trading, somehow hedging a short position on Enron's shares with a long position in some of its bonds.   \"People that are playing the debt are definitely playing the stock against it,\" a hedge fund manager at another fund said. This manager added, \"We're still trying to evaluate different risk/reward scenario on the debt and equity sides.\"   Investors that sell stock short borrow shares in the hopes of replacing them later by purchasing them at a lower price.   Arbitrageurs typically sell short shares of the acquirer, while taking long positions in the stock of the target company. But there is nothing typical about Enron's financial woes and the rescue efforts launched by Dynegy and large banks like J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc.   Traders reported increased activity in the still mostly illiquid Enron debt market. \"Some bids are coming in, especially on the lower priced bonds,\" said a trader at a large New York investment bank that makes a market in Enron's bonds.   Enron bonds, which had fallen in value in recent weeks, gained five to seven points early Tuesday as investors continue to await confirmation from Enron and Dynegy that their merger deal remains on track, albeit at a lower price. Enron's 6.4% bonds due 2004 were recently trading at about 55 cents on the dollar, up from 48 cents Monday.   Under the original terms of the deal, Enron holders would have gotten 0.2685 of Dynegy shares for each of their Enron shares. Quoting people close to the discussions, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the new ratio is expected to be less than 0.15 share of Dynegy stock for every share of Enron stock. That lower exchange was also mentioned in a Dow Jones Newswires story last Friday. At current prices a 0.15 exchange ratio would value Enron at less than $6 a share.   Essentially this new value, if true, means that it has now become easier for hedge funds and other risk takers to play the merger odds.   When a hedge fund shorting Enron stock at $4 a share risked losing more than $6 if the merger went through at the 0.2685 ratio, it now stands to lose only $2 a share (based on the $6 value of Enron stock under the new 0.15 ratio). At the same time it has become much easier to hedge that loss potential by going long on Enron bonds. If the merger doesn't happen, Enron is seen by many as heading for bankruptcy with an ultimate share value of 0. That means that hedge funds shorting Enron at $4 stand to benefit by that amount.   Hedge fund managers and traders said that current thinking puts the value of Enron bonds at about 20 cents on the dollar if the merger fails and about 80 cents on the dollar if it goes through. Meanwhile, the value of Enron stock is capped at about $6 a share if the merger goes through with a new conversion ratio of 0.15.   \"A lot of the guys are still very skeptical,\" said a bond trader at a New York bank. \"But this is really making the hedge trade easier and we've seen more customers short the stock and buy the bonds.\"   Still, this type of bets isn't for the faint of heart, and most investors are likely to wait for more news before taking a position.   \"We're nibbling a little bit at the bonds right now. But the situation is so volatile that it's difficult to be aggressive,\" the manager of a large New York hedge fund said.   Carol S.

Enron Credit Rating to Remain Unchanged for Today, Moody's Says  2001-11-27 16:12 (New York)    Enron Credit Rating to Remain Unchanged for Today, Moody's Says         New York, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s credit rating  will remain at ``Baa3,'' the lowest investment grade, by Moody's  Investors Service, which said it won't take any ratings action  today on the largest energy trading company.         David Stimpson, Moody's managing director for ratings  communication, said although there was speculation in the market  that Moody's would make a ratings change, the company won't take  any action on Enron today. Stimpson declined further comment.         Moody's had been expected to make a statement on Enron's  credit as bankers sought to raise as much as $2 billion for the  energy trader in private equity.         Bankers led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Vice Chairman James B.  Lee have been unable for two weeks to raise the money because of  concern Enron won't be able to meet its obligations. That concern  was heightened after Enron disclosed a $690 million payment due  this week. Enron needs the money to operate as it completes an  acquisition by Dynegy Inc.        Enron Turned Down by Investors Alwaleed, Blackstone, Carlyle  2001-11-27 15:16 (New York)    Enron Turned Down by Investors Alwaleed, Blackstone, Carlyle         New York, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s bankers,  seeking to raise as much as $2 billion for the energy trader, have  been turned down by investors including Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal,  the Carlyle Group Inc. and Blackstone Group LP.         ``I was approached by several people to invest in the  company, but we declined,'' said Alwaleed, a billionaire investor  from Saudi Arabia. The fall in Enron's shares, which have declined  95 percent this year, didn't necessarily make it a good  investment, he said.         Bankers led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Vice Chairman James B.  Lee have been unable for two weeks to raise the money because of  concern Enron won't be able to meet its obligations. That concern  was heightened after Enron disclosed a $690 million payment due  this week. Enron needs the money to operate as it completes an  acquisition by Dynegy Inc.         The prospect that Enron will fail to line up financing,  jeopardizing its plan to be acquired by Dynegy, has weighed on its  stock and bonds. The company's securities gained today as talks  between Enron and Dynegy to renegotiate terms of the transaction  convinced some investors the takeover was more likely to take  place.         Enron 6.4 percent bonds that mature in 2006, which closed  yesterday at 48 cents on the dollar, rebounded to trade at about  55 cents on the dollar. At that price, the bonds yield 22.5  percent. Enron shares rose 21 cents, or 5 percent, to $4.22. The  stock finished yesterday at $4.01, its lowest level in 14 years.                            Declining to Invest         J.P. Morgan and Citigroup Inc., Enron's largest lenders, plan  to provide $250 million to Enron each as part of a $2 billion  package. The bankers have been seeking additional investments,  which would be made in the form of convertible stock, for more  than two weeks.         Questor Management Co., a $1 billion private-equity fund that  invests in troubled companies, and buyout funds such as Carlyle  Group and Blackstone have balked at investing, said people  familiar with the situation. Blackstone and Questor declined to  comment. Christopher Ullman, a spokesman for Carlyle, said: ``We  are not in discussions with Enron about financing.''       ``More equity would leave Enron with a stronger balance sheet,  which should reassure their trading partners,'' said Kathleen  Vuchetich, who helps manage $1.4 billion in assets at the Strong  American Utilities Fund. Vuchetich has 4.2 percent of her  portfolio invested in Dynegy shares.         Enron and Dynegy discussed revising the terms of their merger  over the weekend, said Steve Stengel, spokesman for Dynegy. Dynegy  is now talking about paying less than 0.15 share for each of  Enron's, valuing the company's equity at about $5 billion, or less  than $6 per share, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people  close to the discussions.                                   Terms         ``The concern is that the Dynegy deal breaks down,'' said  Paul Tice, co-head of U.S. high-grade credit research who covers  the energy market for Deutsche Bank.         Current terms call for an exchange ratio of 0.2685 share of  Dynegy stock for each Enron share. Given recent disclosures about  Enron's debt and the drop in the stock price, a fairer ratio would  be 0.15 share of Dynegy, said Ronald Barone, a UBS Warburg analyst  who rates Dynegy a ``strong buy.''        Under current terms, the deal makes sense for Dynegy only if  Enron earns 85 cents or more next year, said Gordon Howald, an  analyst at Credit Lyonnais who rates Dynegy a ``buy.'' UBS  Warburg's Barone has reduced his estimate of Enron's 2002 earnings  to 75 cents a share from $1.65.         Enron needs an infusion in part because it has $9 billion of  payments due before the end of 2002 and less than $2 billion in  cash and credit lines. The decline in reserves has also raised the  prospect that Moody's Investors Service may cut Enron's credit  rating. A lower rating would trigger $3.9 billion in debt  repayments for two affiliated partnerships.                               Cash Question         ``The main question is: `What is the cash position right  now?''' said Tice at Deutsche Bank. ``Is the falloff in the cash  position of the company stabilizing or not?''         Moody's hasn't issued a report on Enron since the company  filed a quarterly report with the Securities and Exchange  Commission last week announcing it had a $690 million note due  this week. On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from  lenders on the $690 million note and closed on a $450 million  credit line. Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watson said he  was ``encouraged'' by the developments.        Liberty Funds Analyst Paik Comments on Dynegy and Enron Talks  2001-11-27 11:56 (New York)           Boston, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Edward Paik, an analyst at  Liberty Funds Group, comments on Dynegy Inc.'s proposed  $23 billion acquisition of Enron Corp., the largest energy trader.         Paik has Enron shares among the $3.6 billion in assets he  helps manage at Liberty.         Dynegy may renegotiate terms of its bid for Enron, people  familiar with talks between the Houston-based companies said  yesterday.         ``The stock market is clearly 100 percent certain the Dynegy  deal won't go through as negotiated,'' Paik said. ``We're just  waiting.''         ``If they announce they've renegotiated the deal, it will be  implicit that due diligence has been done, and that Dynegy won't  walk away for anything that's happened up until now. If they were  to impose more conditions, what good is that? Dynegy needs to  resuscitate Enron back to health.''        A.G. Edwards Analyst Heim Comments on Dynegy and Enron Talks  2001-11-27 11:00 (New York)           St. Louis, Missouri, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- A.G. Edwards &  Sons Inc. analyst Michael Heim comments on Dynegy Inc.'s proposed  $23 billion buyout of Enron Corp., the largest energy trader.         Dynegy may renegotiate terms of its bid for Enron, people  familiar with talks between the Houston-based companies said  yesterday. Heim rates Enron ``sell'' and Dynegy ``hold'' and  doesn't own shares of either company.         The market is waiting for confirmation and details of a  renegotiated bid, Heim said.         ``We'd need to know why they'd agreed to a new price,'' Heim  said. ``It also needs to be combined with some sort of shoring up  of Enron's trading business, which needs to be stabilized for the  deal to have real value.''        Commerzbank Analyst Meade Comments on Dynegy's Talks With Enron  2001-11-27 10:42 (New York)           New York, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Commerzbank Securities  analyst Andre Meade comments on Dynegy Inc.'s proposed  $23 billion buyout of Enron Corp., the largest energy trader.         Dynegy may renegotiate terms of its bid for Enron, people  familiar with talks between the Houston-based companies said  yesterday. Meade rates both companies ``hold'' and owns no shares.         ``If they are renegotiating, it confirms our fears that  Enron's crown jewel, its marketing and trading business, is  deteriorating,''          Investors are waiting for a sign on the state of the  business, Meade said.          Enron's trading business was worth more than $10 billion  before partners began shunning it on credit concerns, Meade said.  A lower price struck by Dynegy may reveal how much business has  fallen, and whether Dynegy believes Enron can regain it, Meade  said.         A New York Times report that banks may extend payments on  some loans until after Dynegy purchases Enron ``raises concern  that Dynegy will be hurt by taking on the vast liabilities of  Enron,'' Meade said.        ENRON SHARES RECOVER FROM A.M. SLUMP  By Lisa Sanders  CBS.MarketWatch.com    4:10 PM ET Nov 27, 2001    HOUSTON (CBS.MW) -- Shares of Enron recovered from the morning's sub-$4  a share level Tuesday amid reports that the embattled energy merchant is  working with Dynegy to renegotiate its takeover offer.    Enron (ENE), which once hit $84.88 during the last holiday season,  added 13 cents to close at $4.14 on volume of 68.4 million shares. The  stock was the most actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange  Tuesday.    Dynegy shares added $1.64 to close at $40.89.    The New York Times reported that Houston-based Dynegy (DYN) and Enron  are renegotiating Dynegy's bid, once valued at $9 billion in stock.  According to the report, Dynegy is worried that Enron's core business --  energy trading -- is deteriorating. See full story.    Getting it done  ______________________________________________________________________    Glen Hilton, portfolio manager of the Montgomery New Power Fund, said  it's a \"crapshoot\" as to whether the deal gets done.    \"I think that regardless of the outcome Dynegy is still in a good  position for the long-term,\" he said. His fund liquidated its Enron  holdings completely in mid to late-October. \"Enron was the leader (in  energy trading), and it's clearly suffering so Dynegy is in a good shot  to take up the mantle.\"    Hilton pointed to Enron's 10-Q, filed last Monday with the Securities  and Exchange Commission, and the falling share price as potential  triggers of the deal's material adverse affect clause. Those two things  could very well make Dynegy walk away from the merger. If that happens,  Hilton said, an Enron bankruptcy is a very real possibility.    \"Very few companies understand what Enron does and Dynegy is one of the  few that could make something out of it,\" Hilton said. \"If Dynegy can  restore confidence in Enron's trading business and get Northern Natural  Gas, it looks like it might be worth the headache.\"    Dynegy has the rights to Enron's Northern Natural Gas, a pipeline  system, whether the merger goes through or not.    Enron wasn't immediately available for comment. Dynegy, through a  company spokesman, confirmed that it was in discussions with \"the  parties involved in the transaction\" related to the structure of the  deal.          Top Of The News   Enron In Free Fall   Dan Ackman <javascript:newWindow('Ackman')>, Forbes.com <http://www.forbes.com/news>, 11.27.01, 9:00 AM ET     NEW YORK - If not for Sept. 11, Enron would be a major scandal; as it stands, it's a minor scandal. The Houston-based energy company, whose Chairman Kenneth Lay is a personal friend of and top fundraiser for President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney, is in free fall. The bailout by rival Dynegy made public three weeks ago appears to be unraveling.     Dynegy's buyout of Enron was originally valued at $9 billion. But just as the deal was announced, Enron said its prior financial reporting was inaccurate and that it had overstated earnings by $586 million over the past four years.     While the companies have not said the merger is off, investors don't believe it will happen, at least not at the stated price; they have bid Enron shares down to the point where the company has a market value of less than $3 billion. The shares closed yesterday at $4.01, down from $78 a year ago.     The situation is in flux, as it has been for months. During that time, several top Enron executives have been forced to resign. Jeffrey Skilling, Enron's former chief executive officer, left in August for \"personal reasons.\"     Company officials said they hope to announce, perhaps as early as today, a series of changes: a lower price for the takeover; a cash infusion of $500 million; new, extended loan terms by Enron's bankers; and somehow, an agreement that prevents Dynegy from walking away in the face of litigation over Enron's devastated employee-retirement plan. Lawsuits by shareholders are sure to follow, considering Enron's restatement and the pay it lavished on executives, including Lay who received $135 million from salary, bonus and the exercise of stock options in 2000 alone.     For now, Dynegy says it still wants to do a deal for its crosstown rival with 2000 revenue of $101 billion.     Even more alarming than the deterioration in the share price is the crisis of confidence in Enron's reliability as a trading partner in worldwide energy markets. Last year, Enron was the dominant player in natural gas and electricity trading--a fast-paced, complex business quite removed from the company's history as a gas- and oil-pipeline builder and operator. The fear now is that other companies will refuse to trade with Enron out of trepidation that it will file for bankruptcy and not pay its bills.     The company had $10.5 billion in debt as of its last annual report, and that number has likely grown by 20%. Already, credit agencies have cut their ratings on Enron debt.     Dynegy and its partner, ChevronTexaco may pump billions of dollars into Enron's operations if the purchase goes through. But the deal will certainly undergo regulatory scrutiny and will take months to close. Investors and energy traders are increasingly doubtful that Enron can hang on by itself.     Enron bills itself as one of the world's leading energy, commodities and services companies. It says it \"markets electricity and natural gas, delivers energy and other physical commodities, and provides financial and risk management services to customers around the world.\" While all this may be true, its popularity with investors was based largely on its fast-growing revenue--much like the Internet companies whose collapse it mirrors.     Few shareholders had any understanding of what Enron did to generate that revenue, and indeed Enron's own auditors at Arthur Andersen were confused. Most of the revenue was generated from trading, but the company's shares sold as if it was still an industrial company and not a financial firm.     Enron was famous for being famous. Before the start of the 2000 baseball season, it purchased the rights to have its name on Houston's new ballpark. By 2002, Enron Field may need a new name.     The name Enron itself sounds like it has something to do with energy, but it means nothing. At the time the company was formed from the merger of InterNorth of Omaha and Houston Natural Gas, the idea was to call the company Enteron. But the namers then looked in the dictionary and found out that Enteron means \"intestines;\" they decided to drop the \"te\" in the middle and go with Enron. Soon Enron may be part of Dynegy, a much smaller company in terms of revenue. If the deal falls apart, it may want to go back to Enteron.      Merger Traders Wary Even If Enron, Dynegy Cut New Terms  By Christina Cheddar    11/27/2001   Dow Jones News Service   (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)   NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Even if Dynegy Inc. (DYN) revises the terms of its acquisition of Enron Corp. (ENE), some takeover traders say the stock remains too risky.   Earlier Tuesday, a Dynegy spokesman confirmed the company was in talks to restructure the Enron acquisition. Separately, a person familiar with the negotiations said the talks are centered on creating a package that includes a lower exchange ratio for Enron shareholders, a provision for additional funding for Enron, and the refinancing of Enron's existing debt.   Even with the boost Enron shares have received from the reports, they continue to trade at a sharp discount to the original deal's value. Enron shares recently traded at $4.30, up 29 cents, or 7.2%, while Dynegy shares changed hands at $41.50, up $2.25, or 5.8%.   Under the original terms of the deal, Enron shareholders will receive 0.2685 of a Dynegy for each share outstanding, or $9.47 billion. At current trading levels, Enron shares are at a 61% discount to the offer price.   According to The Wall Street Journal, Dynegy and Enron are contemplating an exchange ratio of less than 0.15 of a Dynegy share, or about $5.29 billion.   The rejiggered deal is an attempt to restore confidence in Enron's ability to carry on its core energy marketing and trading business as the deal moves toward completion, the person said.   As the market waits for more details from the two companies, some say it will take more than a revised offer to provide takeover traders, also known as arbitrageurs, with enough confidence to play the deal in the typical fashion.   Often arbitrageurs bet on pending mergers by selling short shares of the acquiring company and buying shares of the target. In this way, the traders hope to profit as the target's share price moves toward the buyer's offer.   But according to some traders, there is too much risk, even for those accustomed to uncertainty, to play the Dynegy-Enron deal in this way.   Several traders said they were still wary that the deal could collapse and potentially push Enron into bankruptcy.   Enron's fortunes took a sharp turn for the worst after investors began to realize the company liberally used accounting loopholes to move its debts into off-balance-sheet financing vehicles, including partnerships run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow.   \"There's nothing like accounting to scare people,\" said one trader, who said there is still a perception in the market that there is more bad news yet to come from Enron.   -By Christina Cheddar, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5166; christina.cheddar@dowjones.com       US Physical Gas Prices End Up On Short-Term Cold    11/27/2001   Dow Jones Energy Service   (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)   HOUSTON (Dow Jones))--U.S. natural gas physical prices rose Tuesday, boosted by short-term cold weather pushing into the Midcontinent and Texas, traders said.   But little of that colder air - or demand - reached the Northeast and East Coast, traders said.   \"The Texas market was the big driver,\" said one Gulf Coast trader. \"The Dallas market was buying.\" He said Waha gas in the Western Texas hub was trading at a premium to the benchmark Henry Hub.   Gas was being turned back in the Northeast and East Coast and \"Texas was burning it,\" he said. The cold is expected to last into the weekend, he said.   Traders said the physical gas-futures spread of nearly $1 per million British thermal units below the New York Mercantile Exchange's December futures contract seen on Monday eased slightly to about 70 cents, but traders still look for sustained cold in December to bring prices back to par.   Traders still pointed to some constrictions in eastern U.S. pipelines. Pricing was \"all over the place\" in wide variances, a trader who works New York pipelines said.   In the West, prices also strengthened on the cooler temperatures, traders said.   Traders also avoided doing physical gas deals with Enron Corp., whose merger with Dynegy Inc. was reportedly being renegotiated. In the meantime, several traders said Enron's gas bids and offers were well above pricing seen on other boards, and were \"out of the market.\"   December goes off the board Wednesday. It settled at $2.606 per million British thermal units, down 9.0 cents.   At the benchmark Henry Hub in south Louisiana, traders paid $1.72-$2.09/MMBtu, unchanged on the bid, up 19 cents on the offer. First-of-month November index is $3.16/MMBtu, traders said.   Deals at Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Station No. 65 were done in a $1.68-$2.02/MMBtu range, down 4 cents on the bid, up 14 cents on the offer. November first-of-month index is $3.19/MMBtu, a trader said.   At the Arizona-California Border, where gas from El Paso's pipeline begins delivery to Southern California lines, buyers paid $2.35-$2.62/MMBtu, up 12 cents-32 cents. November first-of-month index is $2.95/MMBtu.   At the Katy hub in East Texas, buyers paid $2.11-$2.40/MMBtu, up 33 cents-35 cents. November index is $3.01/MMBtu. Houston Ship Channel rose 30 cents-33 cents to $2.17-$2.39/MMBtu. Index is $3.12/MMBtu.   At Waha in West Texas, buyers paid $2.17-$2.45/MMBtu, up 25 cents-29 cents. November index is $2.86/MMBtu.   -By John Edmiston, Dow Jones Newswires; 713-547-9209; john.edmiston@dowjones.com     ",

		"_body" : "FERC has clarified several aspects of interconnection policy in recent orders:  EPMI and DENA received a favorable FERC order after protesting numerous  aspects of Arizona Public Service's proposed interconnection procedure (IP)  and agreement (IA), including a must run provision for generators located in  APS-specified load pockets and an unusual liability provision that basically  insulated APS from most, if not all, of its actions.  FERC held in favor of  generators in the following provisions:   -- Generators are not required to execute a transmission agreement in order  to seek interconnection  -- Immaterial changes to the request will not result in loss of queue spot  -- Specific milestones must be added  -- 60 days (rather than 30) allowed for execution (or FERC filing) of IA  -- Generators will not be charged twice for imbalances if serving load   -- Required system protection facilities must be identified in the study  -- Elimination of the must run requirement (can be negotiated with a  generator, subject to APS' filing with justification for proposal)  -- Credits must be applied to any transmission service, firm or non-firm  -- APS limited to obtaining information from generators that is necessary to  satisfy APS reporting obligations, plus APS agrees to inform a generator  of      information that affects the generator  -- APS' liability provision was eliminated in its entirety  FERC issued some guidance on how evaluations are performed.  In VEPCO, all  pending higher-queued requests are included in the evaluation.  Guidance on when studies and the related costs are complete.  In VEPCO and  CP&L, FERC stated that customers withdrawing from the queue do not have to  pay for the possible additional study costs that lower queue projects may  incur.  These costs will be borne by those remaining in the queue until (in  VEPCO) the customer either executes the IA or files it unexecuted at FERC.   ((One caveat--This result was requested by EPMI/Duke in the APS protest.   FERC stated it was granting our request, but then seemed to hold, with some  confusing language, that the costs could be charged to the withdrawing  customer's security.  We are seeking clarification of this at FERC.))  Costs incurred after withdrawing from the queue.  ComEd's procedure provides  that \"Applicant may withdraw its interconnection request at any time, as long  as it pays Transmission Provider for all costs prudently incurred by  Transmission Provider up to that point.\"  FPL's unfiled procedures allow  withdrawal at any time (expenses incurred to date must be paid.)  Consumers  includes similar procedures.    What are \"material changes\" (lose of queue spot).  FERC approved Consumer's  provision that queue spot is lost for: (1) size increases > 15%; or (2)  in-service date delay by more than 6 months; or (3) the site is moved and the  move affects the interconnection to the system.  Duke has filed provisions  (unapproved yet) that queue spot would be lost for: (1) delay in-service more  than 6 months; (2) change in site configuration that impacts flows; or (3)  change in the point of interconnection by lesser of five miles or 25% of the  length of line to which the facilities are connected.  Remember; however,  that most procedures and IAs will include milestones -- failure to comply can  result in loss of queue spot.    Availability of study data:  Duke will make studies available on OASIS.  CP&L  will provide workpapers used in the studies on request.",

It must be wierd seeing your own company in the news everyday.  Kim said that you were in a good spot to rebound if you needed to when the dust settles.  That is a relief to us.  As far as the adoption stuff......we still have a long way to go.  Our home study is being written up this week; we've finished the interviews and have all of our documents into the social worker.  We are hopefully going to get notification from the INS to get our fingerprints done within the next week or so.  We're hoping the INS stuff goes quickly, because that is really the only major thing we have left to get done.  We don't know where in Kazakhstan we're gonna go yet, but, we are about a month from getting our name on the referral list; we'll probably find out possible locations then.  I don't know how much Kim relayed to you, but we're hoping for a healthy infant, and the rest doesn't matter as far as preferences.  We are pretty excited already.  How is Alina? (spelling?)

In looking at LSF, we      were not able to determine that any one zone over pulled.  It looked      to be pretty evenly distributed)     15,000  Due to 5% tolerance on Power packs.   _______   380,000  The total swing was 419,000.

Currently, her tax company is 011 Enron Corp.    If memory serves me correctly, Tax Co. 011 is for employees on deferred compensation. Could this Shelley's case?

		"_body" : " ETS continues working to solidify the security of our environment.  Several projects are underway which I wanted you to know about.  I also wanted to report incidents ETS' infrastructure prevented that did not cause any business interruption and/or lost revenue.  Desktop Management Initiative (DMI)  We are working with Simon Burgess of Enron Net Works on this desktop management initiative.  ETS leverages Enron Net Works for the scripted delivery of applications to our workstations and laptops.  Given the 1,700+ workstations in ETS' environment, it is rather easy to quantify the value received by leveraging this ENW service.  If you consider the number of applications in our environment that would require visits to each workstation or laptop for installation, the $'s add up quickly in costs that we avoid.  DMI will add additional value to ENW's service of scripted application delivery.  Software metering and Application Management are the main two components delivered by this initiative.  Upon completion, support costs are expected to be reduced and the turnaround time for distributing software packages will be faster.  Project Defender (PD)  Project Defender differs from DMI.  Within PD, we are looking at the configuration settings of all ETS workstations and servers.  Once we validate a workstation or server is a supported ETS asset, we compare it's configuration against published minimum supported standards and report exceptions.  The minimum supported standards are comprised of Corporate mandated standards and ETS required standards for the protection of our environment.  Any exceptions are reported and remedied.  An article in ETS' IT Newsletter describes more about Project Defender.  http://www.ets.enron.com/ITNewsletter/projects/projectdefender112001.asp  These are just 2 of many projects Infrastructure has underway to help improve the stability, reliability and security of our environment.  Look for more communication next month on the continuous improvements being made on connectivity to Omaha and our overall Business Continuity/DR process.  INFRASTRUCTURE PREVENTS  During the month of October, there were two (2) incidents that confronted our environment which did not impact our business due to our fault tolerance and pro-active response tools.  These incidents could have had a serious impact to our business, so I thought it important to communicate them and how they were handled which prevented any business impact.  TMS (Throughput Management System)  ETS currently has an EMC disk array that supports some components of the TMS application.  This disk array is targeted for decommission by December 1st, 2001.  The disk array presents four (4) single points of failure for components of the TMS application it supports.  Once decommissioned, these four (4) single points of failure will no longer exist in ETS' environment.  During the week of 10/15, the EMC disk array had 2 power supply failures at the same time.  The array has three (3) total power supplies, so the single, remaining power supply assumed the load while the other power supplies were in a failed state.  The disk array phoned (via internal modem) its support center which in turn, notified our server on-call support member.  Within 4 hours of supply failures, 2 new power supplies were installed in the disk array bringing all 3 power supplies back on-line and in a desired fail over state.  There was no impact to business processes or end users.  RMS (Revenue Management System) One of the mirrored drives on our production RMS application server (GTHOU-WWRMS01P) failed.  The drive was part of a mirrored set.  Upon failure, the mirrored drive assumed the server load and our Insight Management application reported the failed drive to our server team.  Within 2 hours, the failed drive was replaced.   The drive pair was again in a mirrored state within 6 hours.  There was no impact to business processes or end users.  These are 2 examples where our infrastructure withstood incidents.  I believe this communication is just as important as the communication we all desire in times of crisis.  Thanks, -Scott.",

		"_body" : "On behalf of Dave Neubauer,Frank Semin, Lynn Blair and Jodie Floyd:  In follow-up to our conference call Thursday morning, we would like to communicate the \"To-dos\" we are recommending.  It is very important that we get the charts to Houston by the 3rd business day of the month.  We need to encourage chart changers to get their charts in the mail immediately.  As the charts are received in Houston, it is recommended that Gas Measurement Services will be in charge of not only inputting the chart data, but also tracking and keeping a report on when each chart is received.  Once we determine which charts are consistently late, we will determine what action needs to be taken to get the charts in on time, whether it be Priority Mail Service or Overnight Service.  Prior Period Adjustments will be done on each chart that is received late.  As we continue to work through this problem, ongoing research and planning will be done to ensure that a capital commitment is made to get technology installed to eliminate this ongoing issue.  1) It is important that the Operations personnel communicate to the chart changers the importance of getting the charts in the mail box immediately. 2) Effective immediately, it is recommended that Gas Measurement Services track the receipt of the charts and provide a report to Gas Logistics (Jodie Floyd) and Marketing that details which charts aren't coming in on time.  We need to have the report shortly after GMS closes, so that we can make efforts to locate the missing charts and get them to Houston as soon as possible. 3) Once we identify the charts that we are coming in late, we will provide either Priority Mail envelopes or Overnight envelopes to those stations so we can ensure that the chart will be on time the following month. 4) PPAs will continue on all charts that are received late. 5) Measurement will review possible technology to improve the accuracy of our measurements, i.e. temperature-based calculation, chart delineator.  If you have any questions, please contact Courtney Barker (Marketing) at (402) 398-7130 or Jodie Floyd (Gas Logistics) at (713) 853-1465.  Please forward this on to any necessary personnel.",

It is just to make clear that you guys have thought about this and have a plan just in case.  You can officially do something later.  For now ie.  \"we plan to use either ____ or _____ if something happens...\"   Also, be sure and request a packet from Ginger.  The other family, Gras, that I am working with has this.  There are forms for the medical, etc.     Apparently, Ginger wants two things.  There needs to be a Texas approved homestudy and then a shorten version that is under 5 pages to send to Kaz.   Ms. Gras was telling me this over the phone today and is going to send me the requirements.     Hope you were not too tired today.   Suzanne",

FYI - On the Triage call this afternoon, Kim announced the following BPS schedule for dealing with the recall order:  ** Wed 4/3 conference call 8:30 - 12:30 central - agenda - only to identify the issues and not to work on any of the issues at this point ** Wed/Thurs  4/10 - 4/11 face to face @ Con Ed in NYC ** Wed 4/24 conference call 8:30 - 12:30 central ** Tues/Wed 4/30-5/1  face to face in Houston - probably @ CMS   Kim indicated that on the 4/24 call we'd know better what additional meetings might be needed. I suggested that since the Technical and IR are meetings are in Houston Mon May 13 (Tech) and Tues/Wed May 14-15 (IR), that if there needs to be another face to face about that time, that we could possibly have it that Thursday and Friday (May 16-17) in Houston. Stay tuned on any dates after the May 1 meeting.   Kim is going to try to have the NAESB office post this schedule this afternoon.  **  Kim also asked me to remind everyone about the Pipeline Segment meeting to prepare for the BPS meetings (see her e-mail of 3/15/02) Date:          3/27/2002 Time:          9:00 a.m. - 3:00 p.m. central Location: CMS Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line           5444 Westheimer, Houston, 77056           Please check in with the 7th floor receptionist.  Conference calling will be available.  If you have not done so already, please send Kim an email letting her know if you will attend in person or via conference call.  **  Last but not least, April EC meeting - the NAESB web page shows it as being a 2-day meeting - Thursday 4/18 and Friday 4/19. I confirmed with Jim Buccigross this morning that it will only be a one day meeting on Thursday 4/18 in DC.  Have a great weekend and keep those travel departments busy. Just think about all the wonderful places you can go as your frequent flyer accounts build up this year!

Please give me a call at your convenience (x37083)  Competitive Threats  Northern's competitive position is bolstered by the presence of (1) long-term agreements, and (2) a configuration of small-diameter branchlines with multiple delivery points that function as an extension of the LDC's distribution system.  Minnesota: ? Northern's major Minnesota customers have contracts that extend through 2007.  Beyond current contract terms, there is a mid-high possibility of bypass in Minneapolis/Twin cities area (Alliance, Viking or Northern Border); low-medium bypass possibilities in Rochester and Mankato, MN (Alliance). Iowa: ? Northern recently extended the contract with its major Iowa customer (MidAmerican) thru 2005.   Beyond current contract terms, Northern will face competitive threats from NGPL in the Des Moines and Sioux City.  Wisconsin/Chicago: ? With several significant contract terms up for renewal in 2003, Northern will face competitive pressures in the Wisconsin and Chicago areas because market prices are below maximum tariff rates and due to the high concentration of competing pipelines.   To some extent these competitive factors have already been recognized, as Wisconsin Gas has already bypassed Northern via Great Lakes.    The distance of competing pipelines to many Northern towns will preclude bypass for many others.    Major competitors in the market area include: ? Alliance ? ANR Great Lakes ? Natural Gas Pipeline ? Northern Border ? Trailblazer Viking ",

He has some minor, to use his words, rework of the programs he will be  forwarding to us. These revisions will need to be integrated into the written  programs before January 16, 2001.

My recommendation at this time is that we stand pat with the current 75KVA UPS and the redundancy that we currently have in place. Given the uncertainties of the status and ownership of the 40KVA UPS on EB44, and given Mr. Cooper's stated intention of moving out of this building, it simply doesn't make sense to spend the $28K estimated to leverage the 40KVA UPS on EB44. I've talked with Randy Lord and he is comfortable with us continuing to rely on the 75KVA unit for the near term.   I do want to thank facilities for their efforts, particularly Charles Upshaw, who provided a great deal of assistance in reviewing what equipment was available and how we might leverage the equipment.

		"_body" : " I just listened to the presentation on the GISB final rule on intraday recalls.  The final rule requires pipelines to support intraday recalls and allow the recalling shipper to nominate at each nomination cycle, but the implementation of the rule will be in two phases:  1. By May 2002, pipelines must file tariff revisions to be effective July 2002 to permit recalls at the evening cycle or for capacity which was not being used by the replacement shipper.  2. With respect to recalls during the flowing gas day, the Commission directs NAESB (GISB) to file comments by October 2002 on how these recalls should be accommodated, with reply comments by October 15.  Commissioner Massey noted that some parties claimed the new rule would undercut reliability.  Staff responded that if a shipper is worried about partial day recallability, then they should buy capacity release packages that are not designated as partial day recallable.  The releasing shipper can decide whether to offer the space with partial day recall rights or not.    The discussion of the order seems to be in step with ETS pipeline 637 proposals to only allow intraday capacity release/recall at the timely and evening cycles at this time and say that we would need to build additional validations and need more time if required to allow recalls during the flowing gas day.  The fact that comments aren't even being filed on phase 2 until Oct.  -- I think we're safe to assume that this phase won't be implemented until 2003.",

Craig Buehler has subsequently indicated his plans to leave the company if he is not assigned to list B.  Dave Neubauer has requested that Craig be moved to list B and both Rick Dietz (Craig's immediate supervisor) and I are in agreement.  And, if we agree to move Craig to list B, we need to make the same accommodation for Esther DaSilva.  Dave Neubauer is in agreement with this revision as well.

MOTION TO INTERVENE AND COMMENTS OF THE ENRON INTERSTATE PIPELINES                 Pursuant to the March 21, 2001 Notice of Petition in the above-referenced proceedings and Rules 212, 212 and 214 of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (\"Commission\") regulations (18 C.F.R. ? 385.211, 385.212  and 385.214 ), the Enron Interstate Pipelines hereby move to intervene and respond to the March 16, 2001 Petition of the American Gas Association (\"AGA Petition\").   I.             All correspondence and communications with regard to this filing should be directed to:   Shelley A. Corman Vice President, Government Affairs and Public Relations  Enron Transportation Services Company 1400 Smith Street, P.O. Box 1188 Houston, TX  77251-1188 Phone:  713-853-7083 Email:  shelley.corman@enron.com   Nancy E. Bagot Enron Transportation Services Company Manager, Government Affairs Washington, DC  20006 Phone:  202-466-9148 Email:  nancy.bagot@enron.com   II. MOTION TO INTERVENE The AGA Petition raises issues that are directly related to the operation of pipelines. 2.      Enron operates a number of interstate pipelines subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under the Natural Gas Act.  In some cases these pipelines are wholly-owned subsidiaries, in other cases Enron is a part owner.  These interests are collectively referred to herein as the Enron Interstate Pipelines. The Enron Interstate Pipelines have currently pending Order No. 637 compliance filings and may be affected by the outcome of this proceeding, and thus have a direct and substantial interest in this proceeding that cannot be adequately represented or protected by any other party.  Thus, the Enron Interstate Pipelines' participation is in the public interest. III. COMMENTS             The Enron Interstate Pipelines wholly support the Response of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America filed this day and incorporate the comments made therein.             Like INGAA, the Enron Interstate Pipelines take issue with both themes of the AGA Petition.  First, the Enron Interstate Pipelines take issue with the procedural request to implement the new capacity release timeline separately from Order No. 637 proceedings or GISB compliance filings.  Second, the Enron Interstate Pipelines wish to once again voice concerns about the far-reaching impacts of the flowing day recall rights that the AGA petition advocates.                Rather than repeat those concerns again here, we have attached a copy of comments that were submitted to the GISB Executive Committee during the discussion of whether GISB should remove the current prohibition on partial day recall rights.               For the reasons set forth in both INGAA's response and the attached comments of the pipeline segment, the Enron Interstate Pipelines ask the Commission to deny the AGA Petition.

Corp Devel is reviewing the benefits and costs of the remaining 2 planes, as well as the Hangar. If they decide to sell the planes, then they will cancel the lease for the Hangar. If they decide to keep 1 plane, it could go either way. If they decide to keep both planes, the assumption is that they will keep the Hangar. The lease is approx. $180K. I described our use of the Hangar as the Interim Offsite for Gas Logistic's Business and Gas Control functions and will send her the Visio drawings showing the configuration of the rooms we are using. I also described the T1 network connections between the Hangar and downtown and the Hangar and Omaha. She said that our use of the facility would probably be listed as one of the benefits and she assumed there would be some costs to relocate the Interim Offsite if they cancel the lease. Although she didn't offer any hint as to what the decision might be, she said it would be a while before the decision was made, and she suggested we might want to think about alternatives just in case. I did tell her that Shelley may want to give her a call as well.    Gary",

I have serious leadership questions about a group that could continue to receive charts in after the 5th of the month (on ALL 16 charts!) and continue to just file these reports without ever even looking at them or making corrections.  When ask why they never raised the issue or brought it to management's attention, their response is that this is the way we've done things for 20 years.    I'd like to visit with you about the leadership and direction of the GMS group.  No problem with measurement data is ever GMS responsibility -- its always someone elses fault -- the field didn't get the info in in time, the OMV wasn't received, the system doesn't work....What is the level of service that GMS is accountable for.  Please understand that this criticism is not directed to you.  I'd just like a chance to brainstorm with you one on one about how we ever have this group enter the 21st century with the rest of us -- befort Dave Neubauer raises his frustrations to the highest levels of ETS.",

Dan Staines and Mike Roan are doing a good job because rather  than replying that the real time energy market is a bad idea, the GridFlorida  utilities responded that they are not necessarily opposed as a theoretical  matter, there were some practical considerations that led them not to include  such a market in their proposal, including \"(1) concerns that unbalanced  schedules will not work without either some form of forward market or a  centralized unit commitment process; (2) concerns that GridFlorida be able to  demonstrate the ability to administer a market with balanced schedules before  considering unbalanced schedules; and (3) concerns about the impact of market  power in the region on the larger real-time energy market that would result  from unbalanced schedules.\"  Grid Florida then stresses that the decision to  require balanced schedules is not necessarily meant to be permanent and the  ability to submit unbalanced schedules, if not raised sooner, would be an  issue for further consideration in the report on market design due within 18  months after commencement and that GridFlorida has complete freedom to  propose changes to its tariff, which it could do at anytime (through the  Advisory Committee.)

As  reports place each of you in different phases of modification of the last  draft, I have left the corrections and additions in red so that you may  easily see the areas needing changes. All are considered required changes  except:  *The time to retain ergo related records other than program evaluations is  not set under the Grandfather requirements. Most will want to know how long  to keep records, and so this is established herein, but you may wish to  modify the times.  *Appendix II and III is not required unless you do not Grandfather, but may  be used anyway if you so desire. As some have not established a decision on  Grandfathering, these attachments have been included in case they are needed.  If used, you will need to fill in the name and phone number on the where to  report MSD work related injuries in Appendix II. I can do this for you if you  supply the name and number and desire or intend to distribute the appendixes  in digital form.  Note that this version is set up for use by the Enron EH&S Group for Houston  office employees, and should not be used without making the revisions to  reflect your company operations and internal organization in the respective  places in the text. Implementation does not mean you have to have completed  all the requirements in the written program. You will have 11 months from  November 14, 2000 to accomplish that, new hires notwithstanding. The final  rule Preamble allows modifications until Jan. 16, 2001 for programs  implemented prior to Nov. 14, 2000.  This is a written program intended for Grandfathering under 29 CFR  1910.900(c), and if used as a written plan to meet other requirements of this  Standard will need additional modification.  We are waiting on legal review by an outside attorney on some areas of the  final rule which should be available in about a week. A Safety Notice will  then be issued on this final rule. A revised compliance draft for the  Field/Plant written program will be issued next week.  Regards,  Russ   ",

		"_body" : "Catherine,  Your mom gave me your email address and said that she mentioned that I would be emailing you.     This summer, my husband, Kim Erb, and I hosted a 4-year old girl named Alina from an orphanage in Taraz.  She came to us as part of Kidsave International's summer miracle program.  She returned with her group back to the orphanage at the end of August.  We miss her terribly.    We have been working anxiously to complete our dossier and our INS approvals to be able to bring Alina back to our family permanently.  Obviously world events have us very anxious about the adoption.  We are just as resolved to bring Alina home and I'd leave tomorrow if I had all the approvals.  My hope was lifted by hearing that you were able to travel home to Kazakstan last week.  We are working with an adoption agency called Across the World Adoptions.  Their Kazakstan agents are Sergei Pikalov and Larisa Reznikova.   Alina's orphanage in Taraz is called Ulan & this was the first time they ever participated in a summer program to send kids to the US.  There isn't any way for me to call or mail Alina now that she is back in the orphanage.  I am so fortunate that I am able to correspond via email with Sergei's wife (Larissa -- different Larissa) who was here this summer as a host with the kids.  Larissa and Sergei live in Almaty.  Larissa is a medical student.  She is rapidly improving her English through her visit and our continued correspondence.  Yesterday I was so touched that Larissa sent me a photograph of Alina.  Sergei was in Taraz last week and saw dear Alina & she is well.  Sorry for the long-winded background.  I hope you won't mind corresponding with me and offering me some travel advice.    In His Name,  Shelley Corman scorman@enron.com (work) cormanerb@cs.com (home)  ",

A vote will be taken to change the version 1.5 'GISB' standards to 'NAESB' standards.  There's been some discussion on the proper way to vote (e.g., 17/2, procedural).  It will probably be a 17/2 vote.  I don't think it matters.  The only issue I see is that people will want to make it clear that this 17/2 vote should not be interpreted as a vote in favor of each and every standard.  It is only a vote in favor of changing the standards to NAESB.  A comment can be made on the record.  The 'Base Contract for Sale and Purchase of Natural Gas' will be voted.  We have not been involved with or concerned about this document since we will not use it.  If a motion is made to accept it, I plan to vote in favor.  Comments have been submitted and it appears that this recommendation may be sent back to subcommittee for further work.  I'll go along with this if motioned.  Last December the EC adopted revisions to standards based on the recommendations in the Sandia Labs Report.  These revisions have been incorporated into GISB's response document, which has been distributed to the EC.  This response document was received earlier this week; I have not verified GISB's work.  This item is not on the EC agenda, so I don't know the specific intent.  They may want the EC to approve the final version -- which means approving GISB's work.  I have a concern with that type of vote.  They may want the EC to approve the 'Executive Summary' and 'Conclusion' (total 3 pages).  I have no problem with that vote except that these documents have not been updated since the December revisions were made and are no longer correct.  I'll take care of during the EC meeting.  (NOTE: The revisions to standards have not been distributed for ratification.)  The plan is to bring the response document before the Board at their March meeting for \"approval\".  The response should also be reviewed by the Editorial Review Board.   Thanks, Theresa",

I hope ya'll are settling in a bit and things are going smoother.  We had our trustee meeting last night and the subject of inventory came up. I remember two or three years ago, we took an extensive inventory and that each head of each group at the church inventoried their items.  I remember doing the sanctuary and Steve doing the music inventory.  Do you know where all the paperwork is?  Do you have it on your computer or does Lisa or someone else?  If so, could you email it to me?  or give me the originals? Jim said he didn't see it in the stuff you gave him.  He also can't find the Trustee Master Binder; do you know where it is?  Thanks.

At least the turmoil in the markets flushed away some really bad ideas.  Lee Clifford    12/24/2001  Fortune Magazine   Time Inc.   155  (Copyright 2001)     For an instant take on how 2001 treated investors, all you had to do was flick on your TV. Gone were the frenetic performance-touting spots of years past. In their place: dour Schwab ads in which founder Charles admonishes a mock town meeting of gray-clad investors, \"You have to take the ups with the downs.\"   Signs of new stock market sobriety were everywhere this year: CNBC viewership tumbled, ten rate cuts by Greenspan & Co. still couldn't stave off a recession, and highly paid analysts were not only stripped of celebrity status but also sued by investors (Mary Meeker) or humbled into accepting buyout packages (Henry Blodget). By early December the Nasdaq was down 17% for the year, the Dow had fallen 6%, and the S&P was off by 12%.  Then again, \"there are so many scenarios you could have written that would have been so much worse,\" points out Roy Weitz, editor of FundAlarm.com. In fact, since the unprecedented four-day market shutdown and subsequent slide after the Sept. 11 attacks, the Dow has rebounded 13%. Given the year we've had--what with events like the Enron implosion, the Bass brothers' massive margin call, and the uproar over a giant diaphragm in Denver (read on for an explanation)- -it's entirely possible that the last few weeks of 2001 will bring even more surprises. Let's hope at least some of them are happy ones.   S&P 500 standout: J.C. Penney led the pack for most of 2001 but late in the year was eclipsed by Nvidia, which makes graphics chips for Microsoft's Xbox, among other things. The company got an extra boost when it inherited Enron's spot on the S&P 500 and index fund managers raced to buy the stock. Gain for the year: 225%.   S&P 500 laggard: Lending can be a risky business, especially if your niche is hawking credit cards to people with spotty credit histories just as the economy heads into a tailspin. Such was the fate of Providian Financial, which lost a full 95% of its value amid a spectacular run of credit card defaults.   Best way to cash out: Selling your stake in a company you built is never easy, but if you're Tom Bailey, the company is Janus, and you have a \"look back\" provision in your contract allowing you to unload your shares at the 2000 price, which reaps $603 million--well, it tugs at the heartstrings a little less.   Worst way to cash out: Margin calls are always ugly, but rarely quite as big--or as publicized--as the late-September fiasco in which longtime Disney shareholders Sid and Lee Bass (and their dad, Perry) were forced to sell 135 million shares for around $2 billion. It gets worse: Their shares fetched only $15 each in a private deal; Disney stock now trades for $22.   Best fund: In a year marked by--at best--middling performances, the small-cap Schroder Ultra gained a stellar 62% by keeping lots of cash on hand (around 40%), using put options, and shorting stocks (like a hedge fund). The only drawback? The fund is closed to new investors.   Best reason to manage your own money: Fund manager James McCall of the Merrill Lynch Focus Twenty. Merrill waged a bitter legal battle to lure the then-hot momentum manager from Pilgrim Baxter two years ago. It's no doubt regretting that decision now: McCall got his walking papers in November after the Focus fund, which held tech, telecom, and Enron, lost 70%.   Worst reason to manage your own money: You may be a step ahead of McCall, but hanging on to your day job is probably a good idea, judging from the performance of so-called market-participation funds. At the IPS iFund, where shareholders nominate stock picks on a Website, collective wisdom precipitated a 37% decline for the year. The StockJungle.com Community Intelligence Fund, for its part, was put out of its misery in August after losing about 36%.   Most awkward PR flub: When Denver fund company Invesco agreed to pay $120 million over 20 years to slap its name on the Broncos stadium, it was no doubt angling for good press. So when a Denver Post columnist wrote that Invesco's own employees had dubbed it the \"Diaphragm,\" it had to hurt. Invesco threatened to sue but let up when it discovered that some staffers really did think the stadium bore a striking likeness to a gigantic birth-control device.   Hottest IPO: Let's just say 2001 wasn't exactly an ideal year to take your company public. September, in fact, had the distinction of being the first month since 1975 in which there were no IPOs whatsoever. Yet there were a few success stories, including the best performer (from the date the company went public to present): a Mountain View, Calif., company called Verisity, which makes software to detect flaws in electronic systems. Since its March IPO, the stock has doubled.   Should've stayed private: Bringing up the rear in the IPO brigade was Seattle sandwich maker Briazz: Rattled working people shunned its pricey gourmet sandwiches, and investors lost their appetite as well- -the stock is down 88% since the IPO in May.   Nastiest boardroom battle: The acrimonious drama had more twists, turns, and 1980s-style backbiting than an episode of Dallas, but in the end Computer Associates founder and chairman Charles Wang triumphed over Texas investor Sam Wyly (who proposed a rival slate of directors, charging that Computer Associates had floundered under Wang's stewardship).   Biggest boardroom upset: Lone shareholder Guy Adams got so fed up with Lone Star Steakhouse management that he ran against CEO Jamie Coulter for his board seat. Unbelievably, he won--by a reported 2.3 million votes.   Most embarrassing Enron call: There was lots of competition here: bad calls, late calls, and gutless calls by analysts (not to mention the conference call in which CEO Jeffrey Skilling labeled one money manager an a--hole), but special distinction goes to Ron Barone of UBS Warburg, who lowered his rating on the stock from a strong buy to a hold--on Nov. 28, just days before Enron declared bankruptcy. Uh, thanks.   Best makeover: The urge to merge raged this year as fund companies attempted to save face by folding hideous specialty funds into slightly less hideous tech funds. Strong Internet was merged into the Strong Technology 100 fund, and Merrill Lynch Internet Strategies was bled into the Merrill Lynch Global Technology fund. But proving yet again that it really is what's on the inside that counts, the Strong fund has so far lost 39%, and the Merrill fund is down 42%.   Greatest career gamble: With a middling investing record on his resume, James Oberweis, dairy magnate and founder of the eponymous asset-management firm, announced he would vie for a U.S. Senate seat in Illinois. Perhaps in light of the markets' turbulence, anything looks easier than facing the Nasdaq.   Best prediction for 2002: Finally, we wondered what investors could look forward to next year. Fund watchdog Weitz predicts that mutual fund marketing gurus are already dreaming up a spate of \"new reality\" funds filled with defense and biotech stocks. Not the most tasteful proposition, perhaps, but given this year's exploits, probably not far off the mark. Let's just hope it doesn't land them in the loser's circle next year.

Features/The Year In Business  The Top 10 Business Stories ; Talk about a bad-news pileup. In one short year, the longest economic expansion in U.S. history screeched to a halt, the seventh-largest company in the nation self-destructed, and our world changed irrevocably when a few zealots stepped onto some airplanes. What follows are FORTUNE's picks for the most important business stories of an unforgettably tumultuous 2001.  Alynda Wheat    12/24/2001  Fortune Magazine   Time Inc.   113  (Copyright 2001)     1. 9.11 That the World Trade Center attacks could leave New York City $100 billion in the red seems oddly beside the point. They destroyed thousands of lives and livelihoods, shattered our nation's sense of security, and plunged us into war.   2. The Recession With the market melting down, consumer confidence evaporating, and joblessness rising, not even Alan Greenspan's ten rate cuts--and another expected this month--could stave off recession. At least you lived to see the biggest boom ever. Now wave bye-bye.  3. The Enron Implosion Thanks to the energy trader's dubious bookkeeping, Ken Lay went from running a $101 billion company to presiding over the biggest bankruptcy in history.   4. California's Energy Crisis As energy became scarce, the state instituted rolling blackouts and spent $11 billion to bail out PG&E and SoCal Edison. While conservation stabilized soaring prices, the crisis--plus the Enron collapse--left the deregulation movement in tatters.   5. Wall Street Analysts Henry Blodget and Mary Meeker were the poster children for Wall Street hype. But this was the year investors, burned by analysts' stock picks, stopped believing and started suing and booing.   6. Team Bush No one expected much from the President and his advisors on foreign policy. The focus was supposed to be domestic policy, like the tax cut. Sept. 11 turned that around. Bush has emerged as a strong war leader, but his legacy could still depend upon reviving the economy.   7. Telecom Meltdown If you think this Lucent office looks empty, ask one of the company's employees about his 401(k). The entire industry suffered stupefying losses thanks to bad investments and wishful thinking.   8. China Being selected to host the 2008 Summer Olympics wasn't the country's only big win. After years of tense negotiation, China gained entry to the World Trade Organization.   9. Microsoft Why is Bill Gates smiling? Maybe because his Teflon tech firm slipped a Justice Department noose, shook an avalanche of bad press, launched the XP operating system, and unveiled the coveted Xbox game console.   10.Ford Chairman Bill Ford ousted bare-knuckled CEO Jacques Nasser after a year of nightmarish PR, pricey foreign investments that left the company scrounging for cash, and lawsuits that ended the nearly century-old relationship between Ford and Firestone. The scion has a tough road ahead.

First; While You Were Out  All I Want For Christmas  Stanley Bing    12/24/2001  Fortune Magazine   Time Inc.   55  (Copyright 2001)     Dear Santa,   I can't believe it's that time of year again. I hope this letter finds you in the best of health. I think I speak for everybody when I tell you that we've been very, very good this time around, so this is going to be a rather long list. Grab something wet, pull up a Barcalounger, and pay attention.  At the outset, let me say I consider it a miracle that this letter reached you at all. I figure you have security up the wazoo, what with all the wackos sending stuff through the snail mail. That whole drill has to make your job a lot tougher. Be patient, Santa, and don't cut corners. Don't get complacent. There's more than one evildoer who would love to take the blush out of the cheeks of a symbol of Western hedonism like you. But don't worry about this letter, of course! If there's any white powder on the envelope, it came from one of the freshly baked doughnuts I have waiting on the mantle for your upcoming visit!   Anyhow, this year it's clear that many, many people are a lot more needy than I am, so in the spirit of the season I'm gonna ask for their presents first.   I should start, I guess, with the poor folks at Andersen, the accounting and consulting firm. Boy, Santa, do those guys need some new calculators! Please get a whole bunch for them. They approved the books for the fellows over at Enron, whose earnings didn't turn out to really be what they said they were at first. Then they had to restate them. Was their collective face red! I'm sure if the Andersen people had better equipment, they wouldn't have screwed up like that with Enron, or with all the other corporations they seemingly permitted to wank around with their numbers in exchange for hefty consulting fees.   While we're at it, I suppose we can't ignore the senior management that used to run Enron either. What a bunch of boneheads! But this is the holiday time of year, Santa, the season of forgiveness and giving, so why not make their executive homes your first stop? They need a lot, Santa. To start with, they're gonna want, like, thousands of hours of legal time from expensive firms, so give them that. And why not throw in a couple of files they can bake into cakes for later on?   On your way out of town, forget about toys and games and stuff like that and just please leave a ton of money under the tree of every Enron employee, particularly the fired ones, and of course the older ones who thought they were going to have something to retire on. And as for the financial planners who allowed employees' 401(k)s to hold solely the company's stock, I suppose you should bring very special presents for them too...I can't think of what, though...How about we let the Enron work force figure that one out?   There are so many business executives to think about this year too. Most of them you could make happy with fractional growth in Ebitda for the quarter. That would be a huge surprise, and you know how much executives like pleasant surprises!   Bill Gates? You don't need to bring anything for him, Santa. He has just about everything, you know, and what he doesn't have, he can certainly take over and repackage as part of his operating system. But I guess you should try to make sure that there's an Xbox under every American child's tree this year, and a couple of games too, particularly the one where those buff girls in tiny Spandex outfits throw each other around. Just knowing he was making so many children happy would bring a seasonal smile to Bill's Microface.   Oh. Make a very special trip to Carly Fiorina too. She's the woman who runs Hewlett-Packard, you know. She worked so hard this year and had so much aggravation, Santa, so...could you please make Walter Hewlett go away? He's the son of the founder, and he's being a real party pooper! He thinks that the merger is bad for a lot of stupid reasons...like something about how it will draw the company away from its core competencies in printing and focus it on the low-margin computer-manufacturing side of the business, but when you get right down to it, he's simply being a bummer, that's all. Please, Santa. Bring Carly her merger. She's staked her whole reputation--and her bonus next year--on the outcome, and, you know, any CEO who is willing to risk compensation on something must want it really, really bad.   While you're at it, please bring John Chambers, the head of Cisco, a good stock price right away. The poor fellow has six million options riding on it. Four million of them are underwater, but more recently the company gave him two million more at a strike price of $18.50, and they should be worth something, don't you think? If you don't, Mr. Chambers will really feel that $268,131 he gave up in salary to show he knows that corporations should pay for performance and nothing less.   Gee, this is getting kind of long, and I haven't even gotten to myself yet! So, just briefly, bring Alan Greenspan something nice but healthy, Santa--very, very healthy, no cigars or liquor. Vitamins! Yeah! And let's see...oh, yes, bring the Internet some genuine advertising revenue, will you? It could really use it. And don't forget to leave the folks over at the New York Times business section some Prozac. Or Viagra, maybe. Anything to cheer them up.   For myself, now...well, I guess I have just about everything a man could want, so I'll just mention a few of the things I could do without. Bring me no cutbacks in my stocking, Santa, for me or my friends, and no smallpox, and no anthrax, and no particular reasons to travel anywhere by plane, at least for a while. And most of all please do not bring a suitcase with a nuclear weapon in it for anybody I know, and even the people I don't. Other than that, I could always use a new car. Anything will do, as long as the top goes down. And a phone even tinier than the one I have, to show I'm getting more powerful. And hey, keep this global warming going on. It's great!   Now get busy, my man! You're gonna need plenty of time before takeoff this year, you know, to interview all the reindeer twice after conducting extensive background checks on all of them, especially Rudolph, whose nose always looked a little red to me, and to X-ray all those packages, no matter how small they might be, while making sure nothing has been placed in the baggage compartments underneath your sleigh by the grinches who want to steal a whole lot more than Christmas. Fly safe, Santa! We need you more than ever this year!   Oh--and while you're over Iraq, if you happen to spot a suspicious factory or laboratory of any sort, don't forget to pop a nice little present down its chimney, from--and for--all of us.   Feliz Navidad, baby!   By day, STANLEY BING is a real executive at a real FORTUNE 500 company he'd rather not name. He can be reached at stanleybing@aol.com.

Features/The Credit Watchers  The Geeks Who Rule The World ; There's a reason Moody's and S&P have been doing so well. Their customers can't say no.  Bethany McLean; Reporter Associate Doris Burke    12/24/2001  Fortune Magazine   Time Inc.   93  (Copyright 2001)     On Nov. 28, when Standard & Poor's and then Moody's downgraded Enron's debt below the all-important status \"investment grade,\" the company's bankruptcy became a foregone conclusion. The downgrades confirmed that Enron would no longer be able to support its trading operations by accessing the capital markets, and they triggered the repayment of billions of dollars of debt.   But the one-two credit punches pointed not just to a TKO of Enron. They were also a reminder of the immense and seemingly ever- increasing power of the agencies themselves. A much-coveted triple-A rating (the highest grade) is the grease in an otherwise squeaky engine. It makes every aspect of doing business easier, from raising money to convincing customers that operations are solid. In contrast, an S&P or Moody's downgrade is a fearsome event that can dramatically increase a company's cost of capital, perhaps even destroy its ability to raise money. As one critic put it decades ago, they retain an \"almost biblical authority.\"  That's because the rating agencies--private, for-profit companies that are privy to insider information--have come to play a quasi- regulatory role in the market. Many big investors, from pension funds to insur-ance companies to money market funds, are prohibited from owning more than a set amount of lower-rated debt, for instance.   But while the Enron debacle is evidence of the agencies' power, it also brings some long-simmering criticism--think back to 1975, when the agencies failed to downgrade New York City's debt until the city's fiscal crisis was obvious--to a frothy boil. Critics say that the credit czars, for all their inside access, didn't identify this borrower's woes any earlier than the rest of us did--and they didn't downgrade the debt even after the severity of the problems was well known. Indeed, prior to the downgrades, Enron's debt was trading at around 50 cents on the dollar, a sign that the market had already dismissed the company's investment-grade status as farce. \"The rating agencies are always late,\" grouses one portfolio manager.   Of course, neither John Rutherfurd, the CEO of Moody's, nor Leo O'Neill, S&P's president, see things that way. \"We communicated our view [that Enron's rating was dependent on its merger with Dynegy] clearly and frequently,\" says O'Neill. Adds Rutherford: \"We do not want to rush to judgment nor do we delay in informing investors when we believe fundamentals have changed.\"   How can the same entities be all-powerful and strangely after-the- fact at the same time? That is one of the more puzzling conundrums in today's capital markets. The nearly regulatory function of the agencies and the weight their opinions carry make their judgments critical--but also complicated. The agencies can be not just observers but active participants in the course of events. That's because a downgrade can become a self-fulfilling prophecy: If the rating agencies act too rashly, they could be accused of causing a bankruptcy. Yet if they deliberate too long, they'll simply be stating what everyone already knows--especially since today, unlike in the '70s, there is an army of outside fixed-income analysts that both challenge the rating agencies' judgments and profit from anticipating their actions.   True, this debate rarely reaches Enron-esque proportions. And it's worth emphasizing that corporate debt is just a small part of these agencies' purviews. They analyze almost every fixed-income instrument out there, from the debt of China to the complex bonds backed by cash flows from, say, the Mississippi tobacco settlement. Their power, in fact, is very much entwined with that omnipresence. Moody's alone claims that it rates more than $30 trillion of the world's debt from over 100 countries, 4,200 corporations, and 68,000 public finance obligations.   What's more, the agencies appear, in the wide lens of history, to be fairly accurate in their judgments: As both O'Neill and Rutherfurd note, it's rare that investment- grade credits go kaput. Both agencies have statistics showing that less than 1% of bonds rated A- or better default over a five-year period. In addition, around 85% of the credits in the domestic A class still hold the rating at year- end, implying stability in higher-rated bonds.   But by its sheer size the Enron implosion challenges that perception of stability. And it draws attention to the agencies at a particularly interesting time--for Moody's especially. Until recently the actual businesses of Moody's and S&P were hidden away inside much larger companies. S&P is still buried within McGraw-Hill. But in October 2000, Dun & Bradstreet spun Moody's out as a separate company. For the first time ever, outsiders can perform a credit check on a rating agency.   Combing through Moody's financials makes one thing perfectly clear: Credit rating is a fabulous business. Since its spinoff, Moody's stock has climbed--yes, climbed--some 40%, giving Moody's the same market value as Bear Stearns. This year the rating agency is expected to generate about $770 million in revenues (less than a tenth of Bear's revenues) and an astounding $382 million in operating income. And Moody's does this with just 1,600 employees. Perhaps it's not surprising that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is the company's largest shareholder, owning just about 15% of the stock. Henry Berghoef of Harris Associates, another large Moody's holder, says that the biggest challenge facing CEO Rutherfurd is the proper management of the company's immense free cash flow. Rutherfurd himself, a scholarly, white-haired 62-year-old, has few complaints. \"It's a big thrill,\" he says.   Indeed, what's not to like? For one thing, Moody's potential customers almost can't say no. As Merrill analyst Joanne Park wrote in a recent report, \"In many cases, a Moody's rating is practically a prerequisite for coming to market with a new issue of fixed-income securities.\" Like an investment bank, Moody's is a big beneficiary of the long-term growth in the capital markets--without even having to risk its own capital. Kevin Gruneich, an analyst at Bear Stearns, calculates that over the past 20 years Moody's revenue and profits grew at compound annual rates of 16% and 15%, respectively--a growth trend he terms \"incredible.\" (Rutherfurd adds that in the past 20 years, profits have fallen only once, in 1994.) In recent years Moody's has stabilized its revenue still further, basically creating an annuity stream by instituting what it calls \"relationship pricing.\" Instead of hiring Moody's on a transactional basis, some of its customers now pay an annual fee; in return, Moody's rates every bond issue they do. \"Relationship pricing\" now accounts for 36% of Moody's revenues.   Both Moody's and S&P have also done a remarkable job of keeping pace with innovations in the capital markets. Witness the explosion of a new type of debt known as \"structured finance\"--a bond, for instance, backed by the cash flow from residential mortgages. Here the rating is everything: It measures the level of risk in an extremely complicated security and determines the yield that must be paid to attract investors. \"The rating agencies play an integral role in distributing paper into the marketplace,\" says Kevin Rigby, head of Deutsche Bank's rating advisory business, which helps Deutsche's clients argue their cases to the rating agencies. (In yet another indication of the agencies' power, many of the major investment banks have entire departments that do this.) Structured finance is now Moody's largest business, accounting for one-third of its revenues, up from almost nothing in the late 1980s.   As Moody's pushes aggressively into new markets, it has expanded its power base as well. Rutherfurd is especially excited about Europe, which currently accounts for about 20% of the company's sales. He notes happily that there are about 1,500 unrated companies with revenues greater than one billion euros. \"Money coming out of banking and into the capital markets should propel growth in ratings for the next decade,\" he says, quickly adding, \"But we love banks too.\" Indeed. Recently the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision proposed that ratings be used globally to determine banks' capital adequacy. (The proposal seems to be on hold for now.)   This is certainly not a state of affairs that John Moody would have imagined when he began providing statistics on railroad bonds back in 1909. In the beginning it was all very simple: Investors paid for Moody's research, which helped disseminate important information to the market. Some two decades later the government was mandating that banks use ratings to determine the values of their investment portfolios. Then, in the second half of the century, the SEC began to rely on ratings to determine what sort of securities insurance companies, pension plans, broker-dealers, and money market funds could own. Both Moody's and S&P resisted those developments for a number of reasons--but they didn't say no. \"I don't think that ratings should be used to determine investment policy,\" O'Neill maintains today; Moody's has written a number of letters protesting the use of ratings in regulatory policy.   Another substantial change occurred around 1970. Prior to that time Moody's and S&P had always earned their keep from investor subscriptions. Given the growing volume of work, however, those economics no longer made sense. So first Moody's and then S&P began to charge issuers instead. There's a constant worry that this poses a conflict of interest. But unlike equity analysts, the credit analysts don't have to worry about buying business with favorable ratings. Companies simply don't have a lot of choice.   The most controversial development came in 1975 when the SEC, worried that fly-by-night rating agencies could wreak havoc on the market, initiated a mouthful of a designation, the \"nationally recognized statistical rating organization,\" or NSRSO. To comply with various SEC regulations, a company's rating had to come from an NSRSO- -essentially, Moody's, S&P, or Fitch, a smaller competitor that is a subsidiary of French concern Fimalac. The designation has become the subject of intense debate. \"The SEC has enveloped [the agencies] in a very protective webbing that keeps anyone else from challenging them,\" says Lawrence White, an economics professor at NYU. \"There they are, a 2 1/2-firm industry, sitting pretty.\" But no one has a better idea. Says Rick Roberts, a former SEC commissioner who is now an attorney at Thelen Reid & Priest: \"It's a very uncomfortable situation, but it's impractical to take out what is already there.\"   There have been other complaints about the clout the agencies have- -Moody's in particular. In the early 1990s allegations began to swirl that Moody's bullied municipalities into hiring it by issuing unsolicited (and negative) ratings to those that declined the offer. One Colorado school district sued the rater after it made negative comments about a pending bond sale, claiming that investors used the pan to demand a higher interest rate, resulting in a net loss of $769,000. The court ruled that Moody's ratings were opinions, not facts--and therefore the company was protected under the First Amendment.   But that hardly settles the broader issue: In the capital markets the ratings can function as facts even if they aren't. That's because of the numerous regulations that are built around them. The Continental Divide is between investment-grade securities and non- investment-grade securities, because many investors, like pension funds and insurance companies, are permitted to own only a certain quantity of lower-quality bonds. And many money market funds are allowed to have just 5% of their assets in commercial paper that doesn't carry a top rating. So when Moody's and S&P downgraded Ford Motor's debt in October, Gary Zeltzer, head of investment-grade fixed income at J.W. Seligman, had no choice but to sell. (While Ford's debt sold off on the downgrade, it now trades at a better price than it did before.)   And that brings us back to the Enron question: How much should credit ratings anticipate the verdict of the stock market? O'Neill insists that his firm cannot afford to rush to judgment; it doesn't bother him at all, he says, if a bond trades at a different level than its rating implies: \"The market tends to be much more near-term focused. We need to be diligent and make sure we do our work.\" Richard Waugh, an analyst at the Principal Financial Group, agrees. \"What [the agencies] do moves markets and affects the flow of capital. So they have to make very sure that they're right, and they lean over backward to accomplish that.\"   But Moody's Rutherfurd has a different point of view. \"If a credit is deteriorating, we want to be the first to spot it,\" he says. He jumps up to an easel, looking very professorial, to talk about the \"Merton model\"--basically, a way of incorporating the judgment of the equity market into ratings. In his view, that's important, because the equity market is forward-looking, whereas accounting data are reflective of the past. \"We think we're way ahead of S&P in doing this,\" he boasts. Nor does Rutherfurd seem to bristle at the recent criticism. \"I hate the word 'optimal,' \" he says. \"But we do the best we can, and we think it's pretty good.\"   That \"pretty good\" is likely to be as good as it gets--barring a few more Enron-caliber events, the credit-rating system isn't likely to change. As First Union analyst Asa Graves says of Moody's, \"They would have to really shoot themselves in the foot to lose serious market position.\"   REPORTER ASSOCIATE Doris Burke   FEEDBACK: bmclean@fortunemail.com    COLOR PHOTO: PHOTOGRAPH BY MATTHEW SALACUSE Creditworthy John Rutherfurd, Moody's CEO, in his New York office COLOR CHART: FORTUNE CHART Moody's Big Move Stock price index Nov. 30, 2000 = 100 Moody's S&P 500 B/W PHOTO John Moody, the founding father COLOR PHOTO: MICHELE ASSELIN Leo O'Neill is content with S&P's role.   .....................................................................................................................................     Features/Cover Stories  Why Enron Went Bust ; Start with arrogance. Add greed, deceit, and financial chicanery. What do you get? A company that wasn't what it was cracked up to be.  Bethany McLean; Additional Reporting by Nicholas Varchaver, John Helyar, ; Janice Revell, and Jessica Sung    12/24/2001  Fortune Magazine   Time Inc.   58  (Copyright 2001)     \"Our business is not a black box. It's very simple to model. People who raise questions are people who have not gone through it in detail. We have explicit answers, but people want to throw rocks at us.\"   So said Enron's then-CEO, Jeff Skilling, in an interview I had with him last February. At the time--less than ten months ago, let's recall--Enron's market capitalization was around $60 billion, just a shade below its all-time high, and its status as a Wall Street darling had not yet begun to crumble. I was working on a story that would ultimately raise questions about Enron's valuation, and I'd called with what I considered fairly standard queries in an effort to understand its nearly incomprehensible financial statements. The response from Enron was anything but standard. Skilling quickly became frustrated, said that the line of inquiry was \"unethical,\" and hung up the phone. A short time later Enron spokesperson Mark Palmer called and offered to come to FORTUNE's New York City office with then-CFO Andy Fastow and investor-relations head Mark Koenig. \"We want to make sure we've answered your questions completely and accurately,\" he said.  Now, in the wake of Enron's stunning collapse, it looks as if the company's critics didn't throw enough rocks. The world is clamoring for those \"explicit answers,\" but Skilling, long gone from Enron-- and avoiding the press on the advice of his lawyers--is in no position to provide them. As for \"completely and accurately,\" many would argue that the men running Enron never understood either concept. \"One way to hide a log is to put it in the woods,\" says Michigan Democrat John Dingell, who is calling for a congressional investigation. \"What we're looking at here is an example of superbly complex financial reports. They didn't have to lie. All they had to do was to obfuscate it with sheer complexity--although they probably lied too.\"   Until recently Enron would kick and scream at the notion that its business or financial statements were complicated; its attitude, expressed with barely concealed disdain, was that anyone who couldn't understand its business just didn't \"get it.\" Many Wall Street analysts who followed the company were content to go along. Bulls, including David Fleischer of Goldman Sachs, admitted that they had to take the company's word on its numbers--but it wasn't a problem, you see, because Enron delivered what the Street most cared about: smoothly growing earnings. Of course, now that it's clear that those earnings weren't what they appeared, the new cliche is that Enron's business was incredibly complicated--perhaps even too complicated for founder Ken Lay to understand (something Lay has implied since retaking the CEO title from Skilling last summer). Which leads to a basic question: Why were so many people willing to believe in something that so few actually understood?   Of course, since the Enron collapse, there are other basic questions as well--questions for which there are still no adequate answers. Even today, with creditors wrangling over Enron's skeletal remains while the company tries desperately to find a backer willing to keep its trading operations in business, outsiders still don't know what went wrong. Neither do Enron's employees, many of whom expressed complete shock as their world cratered. Was Enron's ultimate collapse caused by a crisis of confidence in an otherwise solid company? Or were the sleazy financial dealings that precipitated that crisis--including mysterious off-balance-sheet partnerships run by Enron executives--the company's method of covering up even deeper issues in an effort to keep the stock price rising? And then there's the question that's been swirling around the business community and in Enron's hometown of Houston: Given the extent to which financial chicanery appears to have take place, is someone going to jail?   A CULTURE OF ARROGANCE   If you believe the old saying that \"those whom the gods would destroy they first make proud,\" perhaps this saga isn't so surprising. \"Arrogant\" is the word everyone uses to describe Enron. It was an attitude epitomized by the banner in Enron's lobby: THE WORLD'S LEADING COMPANY. There was the company's powerful belief that older, stodgier competitors had no chance against the sleek, modern Enron juggernaut. \"These big companies will topple over from their own weight,\" Skilling said last year, referring to old-economy behemoths like Exxon Mobil. A few years ago at a conference of utility executives, \"Skilling told all the folks he was going to eat their lunch,\" recalls Southern Co. executive Dwight Evans. (\"People find that amusing today,\" adds Evans.) Or how about Skilling's insistence last winter that the company's stock--then about $80 a share--should sell for $126 a share? Jim Alexander, the former CFO of Enron Global Power & Pipelines, which was spun off in 1994, once worked at Drexel Burnham Lambert and sees similarities. \"The common theme is hubris, an overweening pride, which led people to believe they can handle increasingly exotic risk without danger.\"   To be sure, for a long time it seemed as though Enron had much to be arrogant about. The company, which Ken Lay helped create in 1985 from the merger of two gas pipelines, really was a pioneer in trading natural gas and electricity. It really did build new markets for the trading of, say, weather futures. For six years running, it was voted Most Innovative among FORTUNE's Most Admired Companies. Led by Skilling, who had joined the company in 1990 from consulting firm McKinsey (he succeeded Lay as CEO in February 2001), Enron operated under the belief that it could commoditize and monetize anything, from electrons to advertising space. By the end of the decade, Enron, which had once made its money from hard assets like pipelines, generated more than 80% of its earnings from a vaguer business known as \"wholesale energy operations and services.\" From 1998 to 2000, Enron's revenues shot from $31 billion to more than $100 billion, making it the seventh-largest company on the FORTUNE 500. And in early 2000, just as broadband was becoming a buzzword worth billions in market value, Enron announced plans to trade that too.   But that culture had a negative side beyond the inbred arrogance. Greed was evident, even in the early days. \"More than anywhere else, they talked about how much money we would make,\" says someone who worked for Skilling. Compensation plans often seemed oriented toward enriching executives rather than generating profits for shareholders. For instance, in Enron's energy services division, which managed the energy needs of large companies like Eli Lilly, executives were compensated based on a market valuation formula that relied on internal estimates. As a result, says one former executive, there was pressure to, in effect, inflate the value of the contracts--even though it had no impact on the actual cash that was generated.   Because Enron believed it was leading a revolution, it encouraged flouting the rules. There was constant gossip that this rule breaking extended to executives' personal lives--rumors of sexual high jinks in the executive ranks ran rampant. Enron also developed a reputation for ruthlessness, both external and internal. Skilling is usually credited with creating a system of forced rankings for employees, in which those rated in the bottom 20% would leave the company. Thus, employees attempted to crush not just outsiders but each other. \"Enron was built to maximize value by maximizing the individual parts,\" says an executive at a competing energy firm. Enron traders, he adds, were afraid to go to the bathroom because the guy sitting next to them might use information off their screen to trade against them. And because delivering bad news had career-wrecking potential, problems got papered over--especially, says one former employee, in the trading operation. \"People perpetuated this myth that there were never any mistakes. It was astounding to me.\"   TRADING SECRETS   \"We're not a trading company,\" said Fastow during that February visit. \"We are not in the business of making money by speculating.\" He also pointed out that over the past five years, Enron had reported 20 straight quarters of increasing income. \"There's not a trading company in the world that has that kind of consistency,\" he said. \"That's the check at the end of the day.\"   In fact, it's next to impossible to find someone outside Enron who agrees with Fastow's contention. \"They were not an energy company that used trading as a part of their strategy, but a company that traded for trading's sake,\" says Austin Ramzy, research director of Principal Capital Income Investors. \"Enron is dominated by pure trading,\" says one competitor. Indeed, Enron had a reputation for taking more risk than other companies, especially in longer-term contracts, in which there is far less liquidity. \"Enron swung for the fences,\" says another trader. And it's no secret that among non- investment banks, Enron was an active and extremely aggressive player in complex financial instruments such as credit derivatives. Because Enron didn't have as strong a balance sheet as the investment banks that dominate that world, it had to offer better prices to get business. \"Funky\" is a word that is used to describe its trades.   But there's an obvious explanation for why Enron didn't want to disclose the extent to which it was a trading company. For Enron, it was all about the price of the stock, and trading companies, with their inherently volatile earnings, simply aren't rewarded with rich valuations. Look at Goldman Sachs: One of the best trading outfits in the world, its stock rarely sells for more than 20 times earnings, vs. the 70 or so multiple that Enron shares commanded at their peak. You'll never hear Goldman's management predicting the precise amount it will earn next year--yet Enron's management predicted earnings practically to the penny. The odd mismatch between what Enron's management said and what others say isn't just an academic debate. The question goes to the heart of Enron's valuation, which was based on its ability to generate predictable earnings.   Why didn't that disconnect seem to matter? Because like Enron's management, investors cared only about the stock price too. And as long as Enron posted the earnings it promised (and talked up big ideas like broadband), the stock price was supposed to keep on rising- -as, indeed, it did for a while. Institutions like Janus, Fidelity, and Alliance Capital piled in. Of course, earnings growth isn't the entire explanation for Wall Street's attitude. There were also the enormous investment-banking fees Enron generated. Nor was asking questions easy. Wall Streeters find it hard to admit that they don't understand something. And Skilling was notoriously short with those who didn't immediately concur with the Enron world-view. \"If you didn't act like a light bulb came on pretty quick, Skilling would dismiss you,\" says one portfolio manager. \"They had Wall Street beaten into submission,\" he adds.   WHERE ARE THE PROFITS?   Although it's hard to pinpoint the exact moment the tide began to turn against Enron, it's not hard to find the person who first said that the emperor had no clothes. In early 2001, Jim Chanos, who runs Kynikos Associates, a highly regarded firm that specializes in short- selling, said publicly what now seems obvious: No one could explain how Enron actually made money. Chanos also pointed out that while Enron's business seemed to resemble nothing so much as a hedge fund-- \"a giant hedge fund sitting on top of a pipeline,\" in the memorable words of Doug Millett, Kynikos' chief operating officer--it simply didn't make very much money. Enron's operating margin had plunged from around 5% in early 2000 to under 2% by early 2001, and its return on invested capital hovered at 7%--a figure that does not include Enron's off-balance-sheet debt, which, as we now know, was substantial. \"I wouldn't put my money in a hedge fund earning a 7% return,\" scoffed Chanos, who also pointed out that Skilling was aggressively selling shares--hardly the behavior of someone who believed his $80 stock was really worth $126.   Not only was Enron surprisingly unprofitable, but its cash flow from operations seemed to bear little relationship to reported earnings. Because much of Enron's business was booked on a \"mark to market\" basis, in which a company estimates the fair value of a contract and runs quarterly fluctuations through the income statement, reported earnings didn't correspond to the actual cash coming in the door. That isn't necessarily bad--as long as the cash shows up at some point. But over time Enron's operations seemed to consume a lot of cash; on-balance-sheet debt climbed from $3.5 billion in 1996 to $13 billion at last report.   Skilling and Fastow had a simple explanation for Enron's low returns. The \"distorting factor,\" in Fastow's words, was Enron's huge investments in international pipelines and plants reaching from India to Brazil. Skilling told analysts that Enron was shedding those underperforming old-line assets as quickly as it could and that the returns in Enron's newer businesses were much, much higher. It's undeniable that Enron did make a number of big, bad bets on overseas projects--in fact, India and Brazil are two good examples. But in truth, no one on the outside (and few people inside Enron) can independently measure how profitable--or more to the point, how consistently profitable--Enron's trading operations really were. A former employee says that Skilling and his circle refused to detail the return on capital that the trading business generated, instead pointing to reported earnings, just as Fastow did. By the late 1990s much of Enron's asset portfolio had been lumped in with its trading operations for reporting purposes. Chanos noted that Enron was selling those assets and booking them as recurring revenue. In addition, Enron took equity stakes in all kinds of companies and included results from those investments in the figures it reported.   Chanos was also the first person to pay attention to the infamous partnerships. In poring over Enron documents, he took note of an odd and opaque mention of transactions that Enron and other \"Entities\" had done with a \"Related Party\" that was run by \"a senior officer of Enron.\" Not only was it impossible to understand what that meant, but it also raised a conflict-of-interest issue, given that an Enron senior executive--CFO Fastow, as it turns out--ran the \"Related Party\" entities. These, we now know, refer to the LJM partnerships.   When it came to the \"Related Party\" transactions, Enron didn't even pretend to be willing to answer questions. Back in February, Fastow (who at the time didn't admit his involvement) said that the details were \"confidential\" because Enron \"didn't want information to get into the market.\" Then he explained that the partnerships were used for \"unbundling and reassembling\" the various components of a contract. \"We strip out price risk, we strip out interest rate risk, we strip out all the risks,\" he said. \"What's left may not be something that we want.\" The obvious question is, Why would anyone else want whatever was left either? But perhaps that didn't matter, because the partnerships were supported with Enron stock--which, you remember, wasn't supposed to decline in value.   SKILLING SENDS A SIGNAL   By mid-August enough questions had been raised about Enron's credibility that the stock had begun falling; it had dropped from $80 at the beginning of the year to the low 40s. And then came what should have been the clearest signal yet of serious problems: Jeff Skilling's shocking announcement that he was leaving the company. Though Skilling never gave a plausible reason for his departure, Enron dismissed any suggestion that his departure was related to possible problems with the company. Now, however, there are those who speculate that Skilling knew the falling stock price would wreak havoc on the partnerships--and cause their exposure. \"He saw what was coming, and he didn't have the emotional fortitude to deal with it,\" says a former employee.   What's astonishing is that even in the face of this dramatic--and largely inexplicable--event, people were still willing to take Enron at its word. Ken Lay, who stepped back into his former role as CEO, retained immense credibility on Wall Street and with Enron's older employees, who gave him a standing ovation at a meeting announcing his return. He said there were no \"accounting issues, trading issues, or reserve issues\" at Enron, and people believed him. Lay promised to restore Enron's credibility by improving its disclosure practices, which he finally admitted had been less than adequate.   Did Lay have any idea of what he was talking about? Or was he as clueless as Enron's shareholders? Most people believe the latter. But even when Lay clearly did know an important piece of information, he seemed to be more inclined to bury it, Enron-style, than to divulge it. After all, Enron's now infamous Oct. 16 press release--the one that really marked the beginning of the end, in which it announced a $618 million loss but failed to mention that it had written down shareholders' equity by a stunning $1.2 billion--went out under Lay's watch. And Lay failed to mention a critical fact on the subsequent conference call: that Moody's was considering a downgrade of Enron's debt. (Although Skilling said last February that Enron's off-balance- sheet debt was \"non-recourse\" to Enron, it turns out that that wasn't quite true either. Under certain circumstances, including a downgrade of Enron's on-balance-sheet debt below investment grade, Enron could be forced to repay it.)   Indeed, facing a now nearly constant barrage of criticism, Enron seemed to retreat further and further from Lay's promises of full disclosure. The rather vague reason that Enron first gave for that huge reduction in shareholders' equity was the \"early termination\" of the LJM partnerships. That was far from enough to satisfy investors, especially as the Wall Street Journal began to ferret out pieces of information related to the partnerships, including the fact that Fastow had been paid millions for his role at the LJMs. As recently as Oct. 23, Lay insisted that Enron had access to cash, that the business was \"performing very well,\" and that Fastow was a standup guy who was being unnecessarily smeared. The very next day Enron announced that Fastow would take a leave of absence.   We now know, of course, that Enron's dealings with its various related parties had a huge impact on the earnings it reported. On Nov. 8, an eye-popping document told investors that Enron was restating its earnings for the past 4 3/4 years because \"three unconsolidated entities should have been consolidated in the financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.\" The restatement reduced earnings by almost $600 million, or about 15%, and contained a warning that Enron could still find \"additional or different information.\"   And sophisticated investors who have scrutinized the list of selected transactions between Enron and its various partnerships are still left with more questions than answers. The speculation is that the partnerships were used to even out Enron's earnings. Which leads to another set of questions: If Enron had ceased its game playing and come completely clean, would the company have survived? Or did Enron fail to come clean precisely because the real story would have been even more scandalous?   THE LAST GASP   On the surface, the facts that led to Enron's Dec. 2 bankruptcy filing are quite straightforward. For a few weeks it looked as if Dynegy (which had long prided itself on being the anti-Enron) would bail out its flailing rival by injecting it with an immediate $1.5 billion in cash, secured by an option on Enron's key pipeline, Northern Natural Gas, and then purchasing all of Enron for roughly $10 billion (not including debt). But by Nov. 28 the deal had fallen apart. On that day Standard & Poor's downgraded Enron's debt below investment grade, triggering the immediate repayment of almost $4 billion in off-balance-sheet debt--which Enron couldn't pay.   But even this denouement comes with its own set of plot twists. Both companies are suing each other: Enron claims that Dynegy wrongfully terminated the deal, \"consistently took advantage of Enron's precarious state to further its own business goals,\" and as a result has no right to Enron's Northern Natural pipeline. Dynegy calls Enron's suit \"one more example of Enron's failure to take responsibility for its demise.\" No one can predict how the suits will pan out, but one irony is clear: Enron, that new-economy superstar, is battling to hang on to its very old-economy pipeline.   To hear Dynegy tell it, a central rationale for abandoning the deal was what might be called the mystery of the missing cash. General counsel Ken Randolph says that Dynegy expected Enron to have some $3 billion in cash--but an Enron filing revealed just over $1 billion. \"We went back to Enron and we asked, 'Where did the cash go? Where did the cash go?' \" says CEO Chuck Watson. \"Perhaps their core business was not as strong as they had led us to believe,\" speculates Randolph. Dynegy also claims that Enron tried to keep secrets to the last. Enron's lack of cash was revealed to the world in a filing on the afternoon of Monday, Nov. 19. Watson says he got the document only a few hours earlier--but that Lay had a copy on Friday. \"I was not happy,\" says Watson. \"It's not good form to surprise your partner.\"   Sagas like this one inevitably wind up in the courts--and Enron's is no exception. Given that credit-rating agency Fitch estimates that even senior unsecured-debt holders will get only 20% to 40% of their money back, the battles among Enron's various creditors are likely to be fierce. Nor has Enron itself conceded yet. The company's biggest lenders, J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup, have extended $1.5 billion of \"debtor in possession\" financing to Enron, which will enable it to continue to operate at least for a while. And Enron is still searching for a bank that will back it in restarting its trading business.   In the meantime, the courts will also be trying to answer a key question: Who should pay? Enron's Chapter 11 filing automatically freezes all suits against the company itself while the bankruptcy is resolved. But while Enron may seek the same protection for its executives, lawyers predict that the attempt will fail and that the individuals will have to fend off a raft of suits. Some think that criminal charges are a possibility for former executives like Skilling and Fastow. But such cases require proof of \"knowing, willful, intentional misconduct,\" says well-known defense attorney Ira Sorkin. And a criminal case requires a much higher standard of proof than a civil case: proof beyond a reasonable doubt rather than a preponderance of the evidence. That's a high bar, especially since Enron executives will probably claim that they had Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen, approving their every move. With Enron in bankruptcy, Arthur Andersen is now the deepest available pocket, and the shareholder suits are already piling up.   In any conversation about Enron, the comparison with Long-Term Capital Management invariably crops up. In some ways, it looks as if the cost of the Enron debacle is far less than that of LTCM--far less than anyone would have thought possible, in fact (see next story). But in other ways the cost is far greater. Enron was a public company with employees and shareholders who counted on management, the board, and the auditors to protect them. That's why one senior Wall Streeter says of the Enron saga, \"It disgusts me, and it frightens me.\" And that's why, regardless of how the litigation plays out, it feels as though a crime has been committed.

Features/The Recovery  Will The Economy Get Well Soon? ; The Fed has been slashing rates with a vengeance, but a credit squeeze could really hurt the recovery.  Anna Bernasek    12/24/2001  Fortune Magazine   Time Inc.   89  (Copyright 2001)     When it comes to recessions, economists believe in a simple rule of thumb: Pump money and credit into an ailing economy, and before long you have a recovery. The bigger the injection, the stronger the rebound. So between Alan Greenspan's yearlong campaign to slash interest rates and the government's latest stimulus package, totaling $75 billion, we should get one mind-blowing recovery, right? After all, the last time we pumped so much money into the economy was in the early 1960s, and things turned out pretty groovy back then.   Unfortunately, it may not be so simple this time. Eight months into this recession, consumers are still buying big-ticket items like cars and homes. While that has kept the economy from totally tanking, it leaves little pent-up consumer demand to drive a fast recovery. So it's all up to corporate America--which, you'll recall, got us into this mess in the first place. As Mark Zandi, chief economist of Economy.com, puts it, \"The difference between a strong recovery and a disappointing one will depend on business investment.\"  And on that score, there's cause for concern, if not outright agita. Most worrying are early signs of a credit squeeze as banks tighten up on corporate lending. If that continues, the recovery may not be right around the corner, as many economists are now predicting- -or if it is, it won't feel like much of one. Here's what's going on.   Since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, many banks have turned hypercautious. According to the Federal Reserve's survey of senior loan officers, the most comprehensive picture of banks' willingness to lend, 51% of domestic banks restricted their lending in October, up from 40% in August. Foreign banks became just as wary, and the tougher credit conditions are affecting firms of all sizes across the country. \"We've become more conservative in our lending,\" admits George Andrews, president of Capitol City Bank & Trust in Atlanta. \"We're turning down customers we would have lent to a year ago.\"   Banks are making it tougher for business to borrow in other ways too. According to the same Fed survey, more than half of domestic banks in October raised the rate they charge on riskier corporate loans. At the same time, a growing number of banks have imposed more stringent loan covenants and collateral requirements on large and medium-sized companies. All this took place even as the Fed was slashing short-term interest rates to stimulate business investment. Indeed, as we'll see later, what should be one of the best times ever to borrow money isn't turning out that way at all for most companies. There's one notable exception--large, well-known firms have taken advantage of a bonanza in the corporate bond market--yet here, too, that borrowing window seems to be closing as the market for commercial paper, for example, has dried up.   So what's making banks so jittery? Blame Osama. Jay Sidhu, CEO of Sovereign Bank in Pennsylvania, says Sept. 11 introduced a lot more uncertainty for corporate earnings, leading banks to worry about the quality of loans. \"Suddenly a firm that expected sales of X was not going to achieve that, and it made us more cautious,\" he explains. \"I think the majority of banks reacted in the same way.\" Now Sidhu is looking for tangible improvement in the economy before he's willing to lend freely. In particular, he's closely watching consumer confidence, employment, and investment in technology for signs of a sustained rebound.   Once Sidhu becomes less squeamish, other bankers probably won't be far behind. \"Bankers are herdlike in their behavior,\" says Zandi. \"They've trained in the same way, go to the same conferences, and talk to one another, so when one bank makes a change, the others follow.\" The trouble is, even when banks become more optimistic, there's a lag effect before easier credit benefits the economy. Researchers at the New York Fed have found that it can take at least three months from the time banks increase the availability of credit to when firms spend the funds.   So how bad could it get? Think back to the last time banks lost their nerve--the early 1990s. Although it's hard to remember anything negative happening at all during the 1990s nirvana, we did experience a full-blown credit crunch at the start of the decade. That's the reason the recovery from the 1990-91 recession felt so lackluster. In fact, the media dubbed it the \"jobless recovery\" because firms simply couldn't get the funds they needed from banks to expand operations and hire more staff. At the time, remember, banks were saddled with bad loans following a commercial property bust. Happily, that's not the case today. \"Right now we don't have anything like the real estate crisis of the late '80s,\" says Richard Berner, Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. economist. \"It's not about a problem with capital but with confidence.\" Still, another corporate collapse a la Enron, and banks might find their capital base isn't as strong as they thought. That's one of the things about economic slumps. Loan quality can deteriorate virtually overnight.   While we may well avoid a Grade A credit crunch this recession, it's clear we won't return to the days of easy money that financed the boom of the '90s anytime soon. The main reason is that the conditions for business investment aren't nearly as ideal as they were in the 1990s. As the recovery got under way back then, Washington was reducing the federal budget deficit, which brought long-term interest rates down steadily. Today we face the opposite situation. The surplus has vanished, and the prospect of mounting deficits is fast becoming reality. That's one reason long-term interest rates have hardly budged this year although official short- term rates plunged from 6.5% to 2%. Since Greenspan started cutting rates in January, 30-year bond yields have edged down from 5.5% to a mere 5.35%, and ten-year yields went from 5.31% to 5%.   While the talk on Wall Street is all about recovery, with markets staging a dramatic rally since their post-Sept. 11 lows, the business environment remains grim--profit margins are at 19-year lows, there's excess capacity at every turn, and aggressive price discounting is rampant. Not exactly the best combination to encourage firms to invest now, is it? And that's reflected in the latest figures, which show that the steep decline in business investment that began a year ago is continuing today. Real business spending on plant and equipment dropped 11.9% in the third quarter, and new orders for capital goods in November suggest a further sharp drop for the fourth quarter. \"Both leading indicators and current conditions point to further declines in capital spending,\" says Prudential economist Richard Rippe. \"We're expecting next year to be just as weak on an annual basis.\"   So are we looking at a replay of the jobless recovery? One discouraging sign: The unemployment rate climbed to 5.7% in November, up from 5.4% the previous month. But that doesn't mean all is lost. After all, the anemic recovery at the start of the 1990s was followed by some pretty good times.

Features/Cover Stories  Enron Fallout: Wide, But Not Deep ; Enron's collapse has hurt big American banks. But not as much as a default by Argentina would.  Nelson D. Schwartz    12/24/2001  Fortune Magazine   Time Inc.   71  (Copyright 2001)     In a bland suburban office park 30 minutes north of Atlanta, life after Enron is taking shape. It's a show of creative destruction that would make philosopher Joseph Schumpeter proud. Only a few months ago, the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) was battling Enron for a slice of the online energy market. Now ICE and its CEO, Jeff Sprecher, are struggling to handle a flood of new business, as former Enron clients search for other ways to trade electricity and natural gas. Sprecher has airlifted in servers from around the country; his tech team is working 24/7 to accommodate trading volume of $2.5 billion a day--a 100% increase in two weeks. ICE's volumes climbed steadily all through November, as Enron's customers ebbed away. But now, says Sprecher, \"by any measure, our business is going through the roof. Enron opened the door, and I walked through.\"   ICE's success at profiting from Enron's failure illustrates just how quickly the market has moved to absorb the demise of America's seventh-largest corporation. It's not that people aren't hurting: Thousands of Enron workers are unemployed, and investors face billions of dollars in losses. Still, not a single light flickered after Enron's implosion, which had almost no impact on volatile energy prices. \"It's like a great ship going down--there's a big splash, but the sea quickly fills in,\" says John Rowe, co-CEO of Exelon, the nation's ninth-largest utility. \"The short-term effect is really not that substantial.\"  Among energy companies that traded with Enron, potential losses range from $100 million for Duke to $80 million for Mirant and $75 million for Dynegy. Among banks, J.P. Morgan Chase recently announced that it had $500 million in unsecured loan and derivative exposure to Enron; analysts say Citigroup could face a similar loss. Those numbers sound large, but they're unlikely to cause more than a crimp in earnings. \"The fallout is a mile wide and an inch deep,\" says Jim Hanbury, a bank analyst with Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein. \"One of the very good things about being a big company is that when bad things happen, it doesn't kill you.\" Indeed, the potential default of Argentina--a story pushed off the front pages by Enron--could actually pose a more serious threat to America's money-center banks.   Large banks are further cushioned from Enron's failure because of the way loans are syndicated. \"Literally thousands of institutions get a piece,\" says Hanbury--from smaller banks and Wall Street firms to insurance companies and hedge funds. That dilutes the impact of any one failure. Goldman Sachs' Richard Strauss says Enron's collapse could trim Citigroup's earnings by five cents a share, but he still expects Citi to earn $3.25 a share in 2002. He predicts J.P. Morgan will take a slightly bigger hit--15 cents a share--equivalent to a 4% reduction in earnings next year. Strauss is similarly sanguine about the impact on Wall Street. \"Wall Street has had time to react, so I think the exposure of major firms is pretty minimal,\" he says. \"Unlike Long-Term Capital's collapse or Russia's failure in 1998, people had a chance to unwind their trading positions this time.\"   The fallout is likely to be felt most keenly within the energy industry itself, especially among companies that, like Enron, had moved aggressively to profit from trading and marketing electricity and natural gas. On Wall Street and in the boardrooms of energy towns like Houston and Atlanta, there's a fierce debate over whether Enron's flaws were unique. The major surviving energy traders-- including American Electric Power, Duke, Dynegy, Mirant, and Reliant- -argue that unlike Enron, they possess major physical assets like power plants and storage facilities that balance the risks inherent in trading.   Ironically, just a year ago those companies emphasized their trading prowess; today the spin is that trading is merely a way to maximize the value of hard assets. \"Our business model is fundamentally different from Enron's,\" says Dynegy President Steve Bergstrom. \"We don't do nearly the volume of trading Enron did, and we also produce power and control natural gas. Enron had gotten out of the energy business and was essentially a financial services company that happened to make markets in electricity and natural gas.\" Even so, Dynegy faces more risk than its competitors. For starters, says CSFB analyst Curt Launer, Dynegy derives more of its earnings and cash flow from marketing and trading than do companies that are more akin to traditional utilities. In addition, Enron is suing Dynegy for $10 billion as a result of the failed merger. Although the suit has little chance of succeeding, any adverse legal decisions would immediately push Dynegy's stock price down. On the other hand, says Launer, Dynegy's shares have more upside potential if and when the energy sector comes back into favor.   Mirant's CFO Ray Hill is especially eager to put some daylight between his company and Enron. \"We have $22 billion in assets and 15,000 megawatts of generating power across the country,\" he says. \"One wall of our trading floor shows the status of every plant, and almost all our trading is driven by our own assets. So if I sell power forward six months or a year, I can produce it if I need to.\" In addition, says Hill, Mirant's internal controls bar traders from putting more than $75 million of capital at risk each day. That's a small fraction of Mirant's shareholder equity, currently $4.7 billion, or its annual profits, projected to be nearly $700 million in 2001. \"At the end of every day, the CEO and I both get a report showing exactly how much capital is at risk,\" Hill says.   Still, executives from Mirant and other companies are taking great pains to tell investors just how their businesses work. Last month Mirant CEO Marce Fuller spent an hour and a half taking analysts in Atlanta and New York through each line of Mirant's balance sheet. \"This isn't a topic that would have been included in an analysts' meeting in the past, but there's going to be a lot more pressure on companies like ourselves to help people understand how we make money,\" says Fuller. Duke Energy's group president of energy services, Harvey Padewer, agrees: \"We've been very open with the Street. No one ever considered Duke a black box.\"   It will be a while before energy trading companies--even those with substantial assets--regain the trust they had before the Enron debacle. Fuller says that while Mirant has already signed several profitable deals to sell gas for former Enron clients, getting fresh capital to build new power plants or make acquisitions is much harder than it was six months ago. That has caused Mirant to slow capital expenditures and delay some new investments. \"There's still a lot of nervousness that something else is out there,\" admits Fuller. \"Larger, sophisticated players with real assets like Mirant, Dynegy, and Reliant will do just fine. But the capital markets think if Enron can go down, who else has problems?\"   FEEDBACK: nschwartz@fortunemail.com   Sharing the Pain   These numbers look bad, but they're unlikely to have a big impact on earnings.

Worst: Neal Patterson Enraged to see the corporate parking lot of Kansas City health-care software company Cerner empty at 7:30 one March morning, CEO Patterson fired off a blistering e-mail to company managers threatening to fire loafers and stop approving employee benefits. \"Hell will freeze over\" before he tolerates a less than \"substantially full\" lot at 7:30 a.m. again, he wrote. \"You have two weeks. Tick, tock.\" A week later the e-mail was all over the Web, prompting Cerner's stock price to sink 22% in three days.   IPO timing   Best: Weight Watchers As comfort-seeking Americans stuffed themselves with junk food after Sept. 11--and news of Taliban defeats invigorated the market--underwriters for the Woodbury, N.Y., weight- loss specialist were able to raise the price for Weight Watchers' mid- November IPO by 9% at the last minute. Bargain-starved investors gobbled up shares of the business (endorsed by Fergie), driving shares up 23% the first day and fattening the company's wallet by $417 million.   Worst: Prada The Milan fashion conglomerate planned an offering on the Italian market for this summer. But the weak economy caused Prada to delay till the fall; Sept. 11 caused another postponement, this time indefinitely. That was bad news for CEO Patrizio Bertelli, husband of designer Miuccia Prada, whose recent haute couture shopping spree has him struggling to pay off some very unfashionable debt. He was recently forced to unload his 25% stake in Italian fashion house Fendi.   Candor   Best: Procter & Gamble The George Washington of business this year, P&G couldn't tell a lie. It admitted to rival Unilever, unprompted, that it had hired spies to gather information on Unilever's shampoo business. The P&G snoops even rooted around in Unilever's trash. When P&G CEO John Pepper learned of the operation, he fired the three executives who had authorized it and began talks with Unilever, ultimately paying about $10 million and pledging never to use any of the information gained from its spies.   Worst: Enron Let's see: Undisclosed transactions with funds controlled, at least in part, by CFO Andrew Fastow. Misstated earnings of more than $580 million going back to 1997. Some $1.2 billion in shareholder equity vanished. Oh, and as much as $27 billion in debt that appeared nowhere on its balance sheet. One could argue that if Enron had been more candid about how it made money, it might not have ended up as the largest corporate failure in U.S. history. Of course, if Enron had been forthcoming, it wouldn't have been Enron.   Prediction   Best: Stanley Roach The Morgan Stanley chief economist began warning of a 2001 recession way back in September 2000--well before any of his Wall Street colleagues.   Worst: John Chambers Where's that 30% to 50% growth you were so fond of talking about, John? Cisco's pro forma earnings per share declined by 23% this year--and that's excluding all the write-offs for unsold inventory and bad investments that you'd rather investors ignore. The only Cisco number that's even close to 50% is the decline in the company's stock, which fell from around $38 in January to near $20 in early December.   Family values   Best: Rupert Murdoch Promoting your kid is one thing; sticking by him when he screws up is another. But that's just what Murdoch (above right) has done. The News Corp. CEO named eldest son Lachlan, 30 (above left), deputy chief operating officer last October. This year Lachlan lost millions of Dad's money when telecom startup OneTel, in which he'd invested the dough, went bankrupt. However, Rupert has continued to show faith in his son's business acumen; Lachlan has been busy shuffling executives in Australia and installing a new editor at the New York Post.   Worst: Florence Fang No one likes to be fired, especially after less than a year on the job. But imagine how Ted Fang felt when, following a rocky start, he was ousted as publisher of the San Francisco Examiner by his own mother. (We also hear Fang is grounded.)   Honorable mention: Jack Smith The General Motors CEO (above left) helped push out his little brother Mike (above right) as chairman of GM subsidiary Hughes Electronics in order to pave the way for its sale.   Layoff policy   Best: Charles Schwab Maybe there's no such thing as a good layoff. But at least the once fast-growing discount broker made an effort. Before chopping heads, founder Charles Schwab and his co-CEO each took a 50% pay cut; 750 other execs took cuts too, and the firm encouraged employees to take Fridays off without pay. Only after those measures failed did Schwab lay off 3,400 workers, in late March, softening the blow with 60 days' notice, stock-option grants, education stipends, and a promise to pay a $7,500 bonus to any employee who returned within 18 months.   Worst: The airlines Ever wonder why airline workers always seem to be on strike? Just days after the Sept. 11 hijackings, even as they were securing a $15 billion bailout from Congress, the airlines announced plans to lay off an estimated 100,000 people. Three major carriers--American (20,000 job cuts), Delta (13,000), and Northwest (10,000)--invoked a force majeure clause claiming that emergency circumstances allowed them to bypass customary notice, severance, and early-retirement incentives; they later backed off a bit in the face of public opinion.   Graceful exit   Best: Herb Kelleher The retirement of the Southwest founder and CEO this year was as smooth as a three-point landing. Kelleher (right) leaves behind a cash-rich carrier that's well positioned to weather the problems battering the airline industry. Southwest, which refused to slash schedules after Sept. 11, was the only U.S. airline to report a profit in the third quarter.   Worst: Linda Wachner Booted without severance after 15 years as CEO of Warnaco, Wachner leaves behind a company in desperate need of a turnaround. Thanks in part to Wachner's bloated compensation package, the women's apparel maker is bankrupt, and its stock, once worth $44, trades for pennies. Not only did Wachner let down shareholders, but she also did a stellar job of alienating key customers--most notably Calvin Klein, who called her a \"cancer\" on his brand. But Wachner isn't leaving quietly: She's considering suing Warnaco for the golden parachute--reportedly worth $44 million-- promised in her employment contract.

On the Cover  Power Player; Chuck Watson built Dynegy at blinding speed but was overshadowed by Enron. Now he's got the spotlight to himself.  Neil Weinberg and Daniel Fisher    12/24/2001  Forbes Magazine   52  Copyright 2001 Forbes Inc.     On a cool day in Houston early last month, Dynegy chief Charles Watson announced the boldest deal of his career. In 15 years he had built the natural-gas producer into a powerhouse, but he chafed in the shadow of his far bigger hometown rival, Enron Corp., and its chairman, the silver-tongued Kenneth Lay. Lay's swagger personified the freewheeling energy-trading markets, and Enron dominated the action, but now the titan was reeling from allegations of dirty self-dealing, a raft of sudden resignations and an SEC investigation. Valued at $70 billion only months before, Enron was teetering on the brink of collapse.   So Chuck Watson declared he would rescue his rival, at an especially sweet price: just $9 billion in Dynegy stock. Watson was sure the skeptics on Enron were wrong and that with a few problems solved Enron was still a rock-solid money machine. Its revenue grew 57% in the third quarter to $47 billion--more than one and a half times what Dynegy generated in all of 2000. For a fire-sale price, he boasted, Dynegy would suddenly expand sixfold into a $200 billion-a-year giant with $90 billion in assets. The supercharged firm would handle as much as one-quarter of U.S. energy trading. After operating in obscurity for years, Dynegy suddenly would become the second-largest corporation in America in sales--\"a world-class energy merchant by anyone's definition,\" Watson proclaimed.  Two weeks later Watson's triumph ended in epic failure. He scuttled his dream deal after getting surprised by a string of horrifying financial revelations at Enron. The big rival's market cap had continued to plunge, falling to a level so low--less than $270 million--as to make Watson look like a sucker for ever offering $9 billion. Enron clearly was headed for Chapter 11, or even liquidation. The merger was off, and the recriminations and lawsuits were just beginning.   \"I was very disappointed,\" Watson says in characteristic, laconic understatement. He also was furious: Enron had tumbled into turmoil by misleading investors, and now it was misrepresenting its finances yet again--so says Watson--and laying the blame on Dynegy. \"I just hope the other side doesn't think all this spinning, which got them into trouble to begin with, is going to get them out of it,\" he fumes.   In the fallout, Enron struggles to stay alive, and Watson can count his blessings. In retreating, he has dodged Enron's $12 billion in debt, the dark cloud of the investigation now under way by the Securities & Exchange Commission, the devastated trading floor and a thicket of lawsuits and liabilities so massive and murky that they could end up burying everyone in sight. Instead, Watson is setting up the next chapter at Dynegy. He took it over in 1985 with a $600 investment and a 10% stake for himself, building it into a firm with a $10 billion market value (as of Nov. 30). With 5% now he's worth half a billion.   Watson vows to make Dynegy even bigger, even better, and an undisputed leader in a gun-shy industry that has lost the stability and swagger of its once-dominant progenitor, Enron. Dynegy says it can grow at least 20% next year, to $35 billion in revenue.   The death of Enron is a mixed blessing for Chuck Watson. Some of Enron's business and some of its brightest people will wind up at his firm; if he gets his way in court Watson will also get Enron's valuable pipeline system, Northern Natural Gas, in return for the $1.5 billion he poured into Enron in the course of the merger plans. The negative: litigation. Enron is threatening to sue Dynegy for backing out of the merger, and Enron's creditors are sure to pile on at some point.   Even without swallowing the bigger Enron, Dynegy is a leading processor of natural gas and one of the top three transporters on every interstate pipeline in North America. Its power plants generate 19,000 megawatts of electricity, enough for a city of 8 million. In the commodity derivatives markets, where suppliers and utilities lock in future prices, Dynegy is a top trader in natural gas, power, coal, emission credits and weather derivatives. But these volatile trading businesses, which contributed 80% of Enron's alleged earnings but ultimately could not make up for its blunders elsewhere, are merely a healthy sideline at Dynegy, contributing only 20% of earnings.   And Watson may yet have a multibillion-dollar merger in his future. Big rivals such as American Electric Power, Duke Energy and Reliant outmuscle Dynegy in some markets, making them attractive partners. He expresses keen interest in doing more deals, having made nine acquisitions since 1995, which has kept Dynegy's top line growing a hefty 45% a year. Last year its stock jumped 218%, the second-best performance in the S&P 500. Even on the day Watson bailed out of buying Enron, he inked a $600 million purchase of another outfit, BG Storage. He's a gambler whose winning streak might not have ended.   Enron and Dynegy were born the same year--1985--but took very different paths. Ken Lay started out with $10 billion in revenues from the merger of two energy companies, Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth. Then he won fame and accolades for transforming a stodgy old gas business into a sexy wheeler-dealer, doing for energy what Nasdaq did for stocks: creating a highly liquid, over-the-counter market for all kinds of contracts. In the process, he slapped Enron's name on a new sports stadium and hobnobbed with the likes of Dick Cheney and George W. Bush.   Chuck Watson started out with far less. Dynegy began life under the unpromising name of the U.S. Natural Gas Clearinghouse, a marketing arm jointly owned by six pipeline companies, Morgan Stanley and the law firm Akin Gump. Nor was Watson some headhunter's superstar: He began his career as a lowly trainee at Conoco. Even after Dynegy hit the big leagues, Watson's aw-shucks manner kept him out of the public eye; he frequently says he'd rather let his customers talk up Dynegy than do it himself. Flashy, no, but competitive, hell yes: He is so fierce a warrior on the links that when he was recovering from an Achilles tendon injury recently, he borrowed an oversize golf shoe to fit it over his sore, swollen foot rather than miss combat in 18 holes.   Always scrappy and still athletic at 51, Watson was born in Great Lakes, Ill., one of four children of a salesman who hawked space in industrial parks. The family moved around a lot and Watson attended 22 schools in nine states. Sports let him fit in quickly. He was driving for a college basketball scholarship until he seriously injured his back in a car wreck as a high school senior in Ft. Smith, Ark. On graduating from Oklahoma State in 1972, he took a job with Conoco in Ponca City, Okla. so he could stay close to his college sweetheart, Kim, who now has been married to him for 28 years. The summer job turned full-time, and in the next 12 years Watson worked his way up at Conoco to the middling title of sales director.   It was 1984, natural gas was on the verge of revolution, and Watson wanted to be in the vanguard. \"A lot of people in this business were scared by deregulation,\" he recalls. \"I was excited by the opportunities.\" Opportunity arrived in the form of the slapped-together U.S. Natural Gas Clearinghouse.   Watson first turned down the job. It looked unworkable. The pipeline companies might try to force the fledgling firm to do business only with their own pipelines; how would he push them aside? His suitors kept wooing him, offering a sizable raise, and finally Watson relented, with one condition: \"Don't pay me a salary--give me 10% of the company.\" He got both, the equity initially taking the form of phantom stock--in effect, a long-term option.   On Watson's first day on the job, only 6 of the 60 employees borrowed from the parent firms showed up. He told the no-shows not to come back. Later that year he bought out the 10% stakes from the pipelines for $100 each and then he got Akin Gump to sell, leaving Morgan as sole shareholder. His vision was clear from day one. Hundreds of brokers were jumping in, many armed with just a phone and a Rolodex. Competing with them was a losing game. Suppliers and buyers would eventually get each other's phone numbers, and one day the fat middleman spreads that Watson's shop relied on would evaporate. Then what?   With the backing of Morgan Stanley and a surfeit of underground salt domes for gas storage, Watson figured he could buy gas at wellheads and deliver it when and where customers wanted, holding it for them when they didn't need it and serving it up when demand surged. This meant Watson would assume the risk of holding gas that might tumble in price; but any trader could handle that risk with some artful hedges.   The startup was barely making payroll when Watson arrived, turning a sale a week and celebrating each with a round of cigars. Watson nixed the cigars and started turning multiple sales a day. He worked his contacts and had staff cold-calling corporate gas users to drum up business.   By 1989 Morgan Stanley wanted out and sold the company for $16 million. The buyers were three energy companies (British Gas, Nova and Chevron) and employees. Morgan was happy with its tidy profit. Had it held on, its stake would be worth $10 billion.   Meanwhile Ken Lay at Enron was discovering the same potential in gas trading. Deregulation had left producers and utilities at the mercy of volatile spot prices. Lay began writing long-term contracts to buy or sell gas at fixed prices. Business grew more stable at both ends of the pipeline. Eventually the raw trading of these contracts--rather than delivering on them--became Enron's mainstay.   In the mid-1990s electricity joined gas on the deregulatory path. Watson wanted in but needed currency. So in 1995 he bought Trident, a publicly held ethylene producer; the reverse merger gave him new access to money in the capital markets. The following fall, Watson cut a deal with Chevron to sell the oil giant's entire North American gas output, the first such exclusive marketing deal. It was precisely what Watson had in mind all along. The gas producer receives market prices at its wells. Watson takes ownership, transports, stores and delivers the energy at a markup. He compares the approach to that of grain trader Cargill.   Business was booming, but Watson wanted to buy a lot more gas processing plants and electric power plants. The problem was in raising the cash. Dynegy had a public currency, but 88% was now in the hands of employees and three institutions. There wasn't enough of a float to attract institutional shareholders. So Watson walked into a meeting of his owners in Scotland in 1997 with a blunt message: \"We have a problem. It's in this room. Two of you have to go. I don't care which.\" Then he walked out. Nova and British Gas exited. The company's float went to 60% overnight. The next year Watson changed Natural Gas Clearinghouse's name to Dynegy, excising an \"r\" to dodge a preexisting British claim. Then he used his stock to make his boldest push yet into power. Illinova, an Illinois generating firm, was nearly insolvent. Watson bought it for a pittance.   Enron was having a field day with deregulation, too. Instead of buying electricity from a plant and selling it elsewhere for a tiny cut, it began carving output into pieces, much as Wall Street slices Treasurys into Treasury strips. Enron would guarantee a utility running a distribution grid all the power it would need on a hot summer afternoon. An aluminum smelter would pay half as much but suffer some interruptions.   As Enron's confidence grew, its trades got more exotic, involving derivatives on pulp, metals, pollution and the weather. In late 1999 the firm shifted much of its business to EnronOnline, basking in the dot-com craze. The site soon was handling $3 billion in trades daily. Revenues in 2000 doubled to $101 billion. Reported earnings before interest and taxes hit $2.3 billion. At a January 2001 analyst meeting, company execs suggested Enron's price of $80 a share was inadequate, notwithstanding that it was 46 times earnings. The shares should have been going for $126, said President Jeffrey Skilling.   By then Enron and Dynegy had gone separate ways. Enron was selling assets, earning 80% of its profits from trading and 20% from energy. At Dynegy the ratios were reversed. In February Lay handed the top job to Skilling, chief advocate of Enron's asset-lite strategy. Lay became elder statesman.   Skilling epitomized Enron's hubris. He had once said of a rival, \"If Thomas Alva Edison came back from the dead and called Southern Co. he'd find nothing has changed.\" Of Enron: \"We're on the side of angels. People want open, competitive markets .... It's the American way.\" To goose earnings, Skilling set up outside partnerships. They, in turn, issued Enron-backed bonds and used the proceeds to buy power plants, fiber optics and other assets from Enron. Then Enron plowed the cash into its trading business while the debt--and losses--moved off its books.   The questions started getting prickly when Enron's stock price fell in the spring. Its business of trading fiber-optic capacity, with revenues of more than $300 million in 2000, lost $137 million in the first half of 2001 as sales plunged. In mid-August Skilling abruptly quit. Speculation was that something was seriously amiss. Then on Oct. 16 Enron set a $1 billion third-quarter charge related to a partnership linked to Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, plus a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity due to \"accounting errors.\" Rumors were rampant that trading partners were avoiding Enron and that it was on the brink of a credit downgrade that would force it to immediately repay $3.9 billion in debt, pushing it into bankruptcy.   On Oct. 25, Dynegy President Stephen Bergstrom was invited to lunch by Stanley Horton, chief of Enron's pipeline group. Horton--without first telling Ken Lay of his plans--told Bergstrom that Enron was in deep trouble and that a merger with Dynegy was the best way out. But it had to happen fast.   Enron's desperate plea in hand, Bergstrom called Watson, who was outside an operating room in St. Louis where his mother was having heart surgery. \"I was intrigued and honored they had come to us,\" Watson recalls. He set one demand: Ken Lay had to call him personally. Lay called him the next day, and on Saturday morning Watson and Lay chewed over a deal in Lay's kitchen. Watson offered a deal with no premium over Enron's depressed price. Lay accepted and said he would step aside.   Dynegy was an obvious mate. The firms are right across the street from each other, and many employees have worked at both. Their traders live in the same neighborhoods--the Young Turks in West University and the superstars in River Oaks. They send their kids to ritzy St. John's School. \"The press loves the rivalry between Enron and Dynegy, but on a lot of issues, we're on the same page,\" Bergstrom says.   For Dynegy, Enron's crunch was sweet revenge. Dynegy execs chafed at the the dowdy image they were accorded despite fast growth and a soaring stock. Lay put Enron's name on Houston's new baseball stadium. Watson bragged about his small p.r. staff. A media search yields 91,000 mentions of Enron in five years--six times as many as for Dynegy.   For all their folksiness, Dynegy execs were talking trash about Enron for years. Off the record, they questioned Enron's assertions it held \"balanced books\" of commitments to buy and sell commodities and suggested their rival was laying risky bets on the direction of gas and electricity prices.   Investment bankers came in to do the paperwork. Dynegy merger chief Hugh Tarpley, an alum of Notre Dame, coined the de rigeur code names: Dynegy was the heroic Rockne; Enron, fittingly, was the Gipper--the dying football player. Watson, meanwhile, was hosting a week-long pro-am golf tournament for 300 clients, one of his first forays into big-time promotion. Some events he couldn't miss, like a round of golf with Tiger Woods. When guests asked where he was, underlings made excuses. On the last day of the tournament, someone noticed Watson heading toward the course in a golf cart wearing business shoes, a clue that he was headed for merger talks; he feigned forgetfulness.   Chief Financial Officer Robert Doty, meanwhile, was poring over Enron's financials and feeling fine. \"We got a lot of comfort that the core business was operating well and capable of generating great cash flow,\" Doty recalls. But ChevronTexaco, which owns 26% of Dynegy, scrutinized the deal and asked--why not wait for Enron to fall into bankruptcy and buy it at a distress sale? In the end Chevron put $1.5 billion into Dynegy, which used it to buy 100% of the preferred stock in the Enron unit that owns its prized Northern Natural Gas pipeline. That, along with $1 billion more at the merger's close, was expected to give Enron the liquidity it needed.   Watson unveiled his daring rescue plan on Friday, Nov. 9, reserving the right to call off the deal if Enron's liabilities rose, or profits fell, below certain levels. His hole card: a clause stating Dynegy's $1.5 billion investment gave it the right to keep the big pipeline even if the deal was aborted. \"There was a lot we didn't know,\" he admits, \"but we thought we'd adequately protected our shareholders.\" Dynegy's stock had a quick 28% run-up on news of the bid.   If Skilling is to go down in history books for his hubris, Watson should get a mention, too. J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup offered to inject $500 million or more in equity capital into Enron. Watson, confident that Enron's hemorrhaging was over, brushed aside the offer.   The euphoria faded fast. On Nov. 19 Enron filed quarterly financials that held two bombshells. Recent credit downgrades to a notch above junk had put Enron on the hook to repay $690 million to a partnership in just a week--something Enron had never warned Dynegy about. What's more, Enron had $1 billion less in cash on hand than it was supposed to have.   Watson was stunned. Enron had provided a peek at the numbers two weeks before, but none of this was disclosed (Enron has disputed this). Watson says that Dynegy got the full filing just three hours before it was made public and that only then did he know his deal was in trouble. What else had Enron failed to disclose? Negotiations went on even as Enron shares fell to $4 and lower. On Nov. 28 three credit agencies downgraded Enron to junk status. That morning Watson called Lay and killed the deal. Lay was cordial.   The niceties ended there. Dynegy issued a press release staking its claim to Northern Natural Gas and accusing Enron of misrepresentation. Enron's chief financial officer, Jeffrey McMahon, disputed that claim and said Dynegy saw the financials in advance, hinting Dynegy may owe Enron a $350 million breakup fee. Bunk, says Watson: \"It's real cute for Jeff to say we got an advance copy when it was 110 pages we received just three hours in advance.\"   Even if Dynegy's biggest deal slipped through Watson's fingers there is a big world of opportunities in energy. In Europe, Dynegy has a growing presence and can play the same games it did in the U.S. as the energy industry there deregulates.   Back at home, Watson confronts months of legal wrangling and a long struggle to reclaim legitimacy for the energy-trading business. The recent chaos in California and the collapse of Enron will make further deregulation--and Dynegy's stock--a tough sale.

Business Week International Editions: American News: THE FALL OF ENRON  AFTERSHOCKS IN EUROPE Enron's collapse will hit many markets  By David Fairlamb in Paris    12/17/2001  BusinessWeek   38  (Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)     Enron Corp. may be based in Houston, but its spectacular collapse has had almost as big an impact in Europe as in the U.S. The energy trader's bankruptcy has sent European banks, investors, electricity consumers, and champions of Europewide energy deregulation reeling. And it's not just the energy markets that have been thrown into confusion. Enron was active in a number of other European sectors, including metals and pulp and paper trading. It even owns a windmill manufacturer in Germany. ``This was a global company whose collapse will be felt right around the world,'' says Alessandro Profumo, CEO of UniCredito Italiano.   Profumo should know. Over the last year, the Milan bank loaned Enron an estimated $20 million. All told, European banks have admitted to lending Enron and its subsidiaries more than $2 billion. In addition, analysts calculate, there is up to a billion dollars further exposure in the form of derivatives and trading contracts.  The European bank reported to have the largest loan exposure to Enron--between $500 million and $800 million--is Royal Bank of Scotland. RBS executives aren't talking, but their stock has taken a big hit. Other banks with sizable Enron loan exposure include Britain's Abbey National, France's Credit Lyonnais, and the Netherlands' ABN Amro (table). ``Enron isn't on the same scale as the Long-Term Credit Management collapse [in 1998],'' says Peter Luxton, global economic adviser to Standard & Poor's Corp., ``but it still has a huge effect.''   In recent days, the scale of that financial damage has become clearer. The result could well be tighter credit for many companies just as Europe's economy softens. Spreads in the corporate fixed income market widened by up to 40 basis points between Nov. 28 and Dec. 5. Adding to the pressure is the fear that there is more risk in the credit markets than was realized. ``We didn't know Enron, but lent on the back of its credit rating,'' says Profumo. As Enron sank, he adds, ``the first question I asked my colleagues was: `What is the value of a rating?''' Just a few months ago, the parent company had an AA rating from the main agencies. It's now rated as junk.   Banks aren't the only ones affected. Enron stock and bonds were widely held by European mutual funds and insurers. The lucky ones offloaded their stakes as the extent of the company's problems started to come out. ``I knew I had to get out in August, when they canceled a meeting with me at the last minute--after I'd arrived in Houston,'' says a fund manager at a private German bank. He quickly dumped $50 million of Enron stock. Insurers that still held big blocks of Enron shares when it collapsed include Germany's Allianz, France's AXA, and Holland's Aegon. Analysts estimate Aegon's exposure at $200 million.   Meanwhile, Europe's spot and futures markets for electricity are in chaos. Enron was a big electricity supplier and trader in Europe, at the height of its activity accounting for up to 20% of volume traded on the energy exchanges. Most energy and power companies already had wound down their exposure to Enron by the time its collapse became imminent. But the scale of the company's problems and the speed with which it collapsed have unsettled many traders. Not surprisingly, the price of energy futures is on the way up. Because Enron's aggressive pricing had helped bring down tariffs, businesses and domestic consumers will have to pay more for their energy this winter. Prices will probably rise fastest--up to 2.5%--in Britain's deregulated market, say analysts. Enron was a particularly large player there, producing electricity and delivering it to 2.2 million retail consumers and thousands of companies.   Even more than in the U.S., Enron's woes are likely to increase resistance to energy deregulation. Although Germany and Britain have almost wholly liberalized their markets, progress elsewhere, especially France, has been slow. Opponents of reform will use the Enron debacle to hold up the process. ``They're going to make a real meal out of this in Paris,'' says a European Commission official in Brussels.

Cover Story  THE FALL OF ENRON How ex-CEO Jeff Skilling's strategy grew so complex that even his boss couldn't get a handle on it  By Wendy Zellner and Stephanie Anderson Forest in Dallas with Emily Thornton, Peter Coy, Heather Timmons, Louis Lavelle, and David Henry in New York, and bureau reports    12/17/2001  BusinessWeek   30  (Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)     To former Enron CEO Jeffrey K. Skilling, there were two kinds of people in the world: those who got it and those who didn't. ``It'' was Enron's complex strategy for minting rich profits and returns from a trading and risk-management business built essentially on assets owned by others. Vertically integrated behemoths like ExxonMobil Corp., whose balance sheet was rich with oil reserves, gas stations, and other assets, were dinosaurs to a contemptuous Skilling. ``In the old days, people worked for the assets,'' Skilling mused in an interview last January. ``We've turned it around--what we've said is the assets work for the people.''   But who looks like Tyrannosaurus Rex now? As Enron Corp. struggles to salvage something from the nation's largest bankruptcy case, filed on Dec. 2, it's clear that the real Enron was a far cry from the nimble ``asset light'' market maker that Skilling proclaimed. And the financial maneuvering and off-balance-sheet partnerships that he and ex-Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow perfected to remove everything from telecom fiber to water companies from Enron's debt-heavy balance sheet helped spark the company's implosion. ``Jeff's theory was assets were bad, intellectual capital was good,'' says one former senior executive. Employees readily embraced the rhetoric, the executive says, but they ``didn't understand how it was funded.''  Neither did many others. Bankers, stock analysts, auditors, and Enron's own board failed to comprehend the risks in this heavily leveraged trading giant. Enron's bankruptcy filings show $13.1 billion in debt for the parent company and an additional $18.1 billion for affiliates. But that doesn't include at least $20 billion more estimated to exist off the balance sheet. Kenneth L. Lay, 59, who had nurtured Skilling, 48, as his successor, sparked the first wave of panic when he revealed in an Oct. 16 conference call with analysts that deals involving partnerships run by his CFO would knock $1.2 billion off shareholder equity. Lay, who had been out of day-to-day management for years, was never able to clearly explain how the partnerships worked or why anyone shouldn't assume the worst--that they were set up to hide Enron's problems, inflate earnings, and personally benefit the executives who managed some of them.   That uncertainty ultimately scuttled Enron's best hope for a rescue: its deal to be acquired by its smaller but healthier rival, Dynegy Inc. Now Enron is frantically seeking a rock-solid banking partner to help maintain some shred of its once-mighty trading empire. Already, 4,000 Enron workers in Houston have lost their jobs. And hundreds of creditors, from banks to telecoms to construction companies, are trying to recover part of the billions they're owed.   From the beginning, Lay had a vision for Enron that went far beyond that of a traditional energy company. When Lay formed Enron from the merger of two pipeline companies in 1985, he understood that deregulation of the business would offer vast new opportunities. To exploit them, he turned to Skilling, then a McKinsey & Co. consultant. Skilling was the chief nuts-and-bolts-operator from 1997 until his departure last summer, and the architect of an increasingly byzantine financial structure. After he abruptly quit in August, citing personal reasons, and his right-hand financier Fastow was ousted Oct. 24, there was no one left to explain it.   Much of the blame for Enron's collapse has focused on the partnerships, but the seeds of its destruction were planted well before the October surprises. According to former insiders and other sources close to Enron, it was already on shaky financial ground from a slew of bad investments, including overseas projects ranging from a water business in England to a power distributor in Brazil. ``You make enough billion-dollar mistakes, and they add up,'' says one source close to Enron's top executives. In June, Standard & Poor's analysts put the company on notice that its underperforming international assets were of growing concern. But S&P, which like BusinessWeek is a unit of The McGraw-Hill companies, ultimately reaffirmed the credit ratings, based on Enron's apparent willingness to sell assets and take other steps.   Behind all the analyses of Enron was the assumption that the core energy business was thriving. It was still growing rapidly, but margins were inevitably coming down as the market matured. ``Once that growth slowed, any weakness would start becoming more apparent,'' says Standard & Poor's Corp. director Todd A. Shipman. ``They were not the best at watching their cost.'' Indeed, the tight risk controls that seemed to work well in the trading business apparently didn't apply to other parts of the company.   Skilling's answer to growing competition in energy trading was to push Enron's innovative techniques into new arenas, everything from broadband to metals, steel, and even advertising time and space. Skilling knew he had to find a way to finance his big growth plans and manage the international problems without killing the company's critical investment-grade credit rating. Without a clever solution, trading partners would flee, or the cost of doing deals would become insurmountable. ``HE'S HEARTBROKEN.'' No one ever disputed that Skilling was clever. The Pittsburgh-born son of a sales manager for an Illinois valve company, he took over as production director at a startup Aurora (Ill.) TV station at age 13 when an older staffer quit and he was the only one who knew how to operate the equipment. Skilling landed a full-tuition scholarship to Southern Methodist University in Dallas to study engineering, but quickly changed to business. After graduation, he went to work for a Houston bank. The bank later went bust while Skilling was at Harvard Business School. Skilling said that fiasco made him determined to keep strict risk controls on Enron's trading business. He once told BusinessWeek that ``I've never not been successful in business or work, ever.'' Skilling now declines to comment, but his brother Tom, a Chicago TV weatherman, says of him: ``He's heartbroken over what's going on there.... We were not raised to look on these kinds of things absent emotion.''   Enron's ``intellectual capital'' was Skilling's pride and joy. He recruited more than 250 newly minted MBAs each year from the nation's top business schools. Meteorologists and PhDs in math and economics helped analyze and model the vast amounts of data that Enron used in its trading operations. A forced ranking system weeded out the poor performers. ``It was as competitive internally as it was externally,'' says one former executive.   It was no surprise then that Skilling would turn to a bright young finance wizard, Fastow, to help him find capital for his rapidly expanding empire. Boasting an MBA from Northwestern University, Fastow was recruited to Enron in 1990 from Continental Bank, where he worked on leveraged buyouts. Articulate, handsome, and mature beyond his years, he became Enron's CFO at age 36. In October, 1999, he earned CFO Magazine's CFO Excellence Award for Capital Structure Management. An effusive Skilling crowed to the magazine: ``We didn't want someone stuck in the past, since the industry of yesterday is no longer. Andy has the intelligence and the youthful exuberance to think in new ways.''   But Skilling's fondness for the buttoned-down Fastow was not widely shared. Many colleagues considered him a prickly, even vindictive man, prone to attacking those he didn't like in Enron's group performance reviews. Fastow, through his attorney, declined to comment for this story. When he formed and took a personal stake in the LJM partnerships that blew up in October, the conflict of interest inherent in those deals only added to his colleagues' distaste for him. Enron admits Fastow earned more than $30 million from the partnerships. The Enron CFO wasn't any more popular on Wall Street, where investment bankers bristled at the finance group's ``we're smarter than you guys'' attitude. Indeed, that came back to haunt Enron when it needed capital commitments to stem the liquidity crisis. ``It's the sort of organization about which people said, `Screw them. We don't really owe them anything,''' says one investment banker.   While LJM--and Fastow's direct personal involvement and enrichment--shocked many, the deal was just the latest version of a financing strategy that Skilling and Fastow had used to good effect many times since the mid-'90s to fund investments with private equity while keeping assets and debt off the balance sheet. Keeping the debt off Enron's books depended on a steady or rising stock price and an investment- grade credit rating. ``They were put together with good intentions to offset some risk,'' says S&P analyst Ron M. Barone. ``It's conceivable that it got away from them.``   Did it ever. The off-balance-sheet structures grew increasingly complex and risky, according to insiders and others who have studied the deals. Some, with names like Osprey, Whitewing, and Marlin, were revealed in Enron's financial filings and even rated by the big credit-rating agencies. But almost no one seemed to have a clear picture of Enron's total debt, what triggers might hasten repayment, or how some of the deals could dilute shareholder equity. ``No one ever sat down and added up how many liabilities would come due if this company got downgraded,'' says one lender involved with Enron. Many investors were unaware of provisions in some deals that could essentially dump the debts back on Enron. In some cases, if Enron's stock fell below a certain price and the credit rating dropped below investment grade--once unimaginable--nearly $4 billion in partnership debt would have to be covered by Enron. At the same time, the value of the assets in many of these partnerships was dropping, making it even harder for Enron to cover the debt. HIGH HOPES. Skilling tried to accelerate the sale of international assets after becoming chief operating officer in 1997, but the efforts were arduous and time-consuming. Even as tech stocks melted down, Skilling was determined not to scale back his grandiose broadband trading dreams or the resulting price-to-earnings multiple of almost 60 that they helped create for Enron's stock. At its peak in August, 2000, about a third of the stock's $90 price was attributable to expectations for growth of broadband trading, executives estimate.   That rapidly rising stock price--up 55% in '99 and 87% in 2000--gave Skilling and Fastow a hot currency for luring investors into their off-balance-sheet deals. They quickly became dependent on such deals to finance their expansion efforts. ``It was like crack,'' says a company insider. Trouble is, Enron's stock came tumbling back to earth when market valuations fell this year. By April, its price had fallen to about 55. And its far-flung operational troubles were taking their own toll. In its much-hyped broadband business, for instance, a capacity glut and financial meltdown made it hard to find creditworthy counterparties for trading. And after spending some $1.2 billion to build and operate a fiber-optic network, Enron found itself with an asset whose value was rapidly deteriorating. Even last year, company executives could see the need to cut back an operation that had 1,700 employees and a cash burn rate of $700 million a year. ``SOMETHING TO PROVE.'' And the international problems weren't going away. Enron's 65% stake in the $3 billion Dabhol power plant in India was mired in a dispute with its largest customer, which refused to pay for electricity. Some Indian politicians have despised the deal for years, claiming that cunning and even corrupt Enron executives cut a deal that charged India too much for its power.   Enron's ill-fated 1998 investment in the water-services business was another drag on earnings. Many saw the purchase of Wessex Water in England as a ``consolation prize'' for Rebecca P. Mark, the hard-charging Enron executive who had negotiated the Dabhol deal and other investments around the world. With Skilling having won out as Lay's clear heir apparent, top executives wanted to move her out of the way, say former insiders. A narrowly split board approved the Wessex deal, which formed the core of Azurix Corp., to be run by Mark. But Enron was blindsided by British regulators who slashed the rates the utility could charge. Meanwhile, Mark piled on more high-priced water assets. ``Once [Skilling] put her there, he let her go wild,'' says a former executive. ``And she's going to go wild because she has something to prove.'' Mark spent too much on a water concession in Brazil and ran into political obstacles. She declined to comment for this story.   But if Azurix was a prime example of Enron's sketchy investment strategy, it also demonstrated how the company tried to disguise its problems with financial alchemy. To set up the company, Enron formed a partnership called the Atlantic Water Trust, in which it held a 50% stake. That kept Wessex off Enron's balance sheet. Enron's partner in the joint venture was Marlin Water Trust, which consisted of institutional investors. To help attract them, Enron promised to back up the debt with its own stock if necessary. But if Enron's credit rating fell below investment grade and the stock fell below a certain point, Enron could be on the hook for the partnership's $915 million in debt.   The end for Enron came when its murky finances and less-than-forthright disclosures spooked investors and Dynegy. The clincher came when Dynegy's bankers spent hours sifting through a supposedly final draft of Enron's about-to-be-released 10Q--only to discover two pages of damning new numbers when the quarterly statement was made publicly available. Debt coming due in the fourth quarter had leapt from under $1 billion to $2.8 billion. Even worse, cash on hand--to which Dynegy had recently contributed $1.5 billion--shrunk from $3 billion to $1.2 billion. Dynegy ``had a two-hour meeting with the new treasurer of Enron, who had been in that seat for two weeks,'' said a source close to the deal. ``He had no clue where the numbers came from.'' RESPECT FOR ASSETS. Skilling and Fastow face most of the wrath of reeling employees. ``Someone told me yesterday if they see Jeff Skilling on the street, they would scratch out his eyes,'' says a former executive. One of Fastow's lawyers, David B. Gerger, says his client has been the subject of death threats and anti-Semitic tirades in Internet chat rooms. ``Naturally people look for scapegoats, but it would be wrong to scapegoat Mr. Fastow,'' says Gerger.   He confirms that Fastow has hired a big gun to handle his civil litigation: David Boies's firm, which represented the Justice Dept. in its suit against Microsoft Corp. On Dec. 5, Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach filed a suit against Fastow, Skilling, and 27 other Enron executives, saying they illegally made more than $1 billion off stock sales before Enron tanked. And a source at the Securities & Exchange Commission says four U.S. Attorney Offices are considering whether to pursue criminal charges against Enron and its officers.   Would the cash squeeze have caught up to Enron, even without Skilling's and Fastow's fancy financing? Credit analysts still argue that the debt would have been manageable, absent the crisis of confidence that dried up Enron's trading business and access to the capital markets. But even they have a new respect for old-fashioned, high-quality assets. ``When things get really tough, hard assets are the kind you can depend upon,'' says S&P's Shipman. That's something Enron's whiz-kid financiers failed to appreciate.

Editorials  ENRON: LET US COUNT THE CULPRITS    12/17/2001  BusinessWeek   154  (Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)     Enron Corp.'s bankruptcy is a disaster of epic proportions by any measure--the height from which it fell, the speed with which it has unraveled, and the pain it has inflicted on investors, employees, and creditors. Virtually all the checks and balances designed to prevent this kind of financial meltdown failed. Unless remedied, this could undermine public trust, the capital markets, and the nation's entire equity culture. Even now, no one really knows what liabilities are buried inside dozens of partnerships or the role ex-CEO Jeffrey Skilling played in creating a byzantine system of off-balance-sheet operations. A culture of secrecy and a remarkable lack of transparency prevented any realistic assessment of the company's financial risk. Nothing less than an overhaul of the auditing profession is now required to police accounting standards. Wall Street, mutual funds, and the business press would also do well to rethink why each, in its own way, celebrated what is now revealed to be an arrogant, duplicitous company managed in a dangerous manner (page 30).   What is increasingly clear is that Skilling, a former McKinsey & Co. consultant and Harvard Business School grad, tried to craft Enron as a new kind of virtual trading giant, operating outside the scrutiny of investors and regulators. Enron's numerous partnerships were shrouded in secrecy, tucked away off the balance sheet. They were used to shift debt and assets off the books while inflating earnings. The chief financial officer ran and partly owned two partnerships, a clear conflict of interest. Enron leveraged itself without a reality check by any outsider. ASLEEP. Hardly anyone inside the company was urging caution, certainly not chairman Ken Lay. The independent auditing committee on the board of directors was clearly asleep. Given Enron's arcane financial engineering, the committee probably relied on Arthur Andersen, the auditor, for information. But Andersen didn't blow any whistles. No surprise there. It made more money selling consulting services to Enron last year than it did auditing the company. Criticizing Enron's books might have jeopardized consulting work. Similar conflicts of interest stopped Wall Street analysts from pulling the plug on Enron. Even as Enron slid toward bankruptcy, ``buy'' recommendations were being issued by analysts whose firms were doing investment-banking business with the company, or were hoping to.  Did anyone really know what was going on inside Enron? The rating agencies, Moody's Investor Service and Standard & Poor's, presumably had better access than average investors, but neither downgraded Enron's credit rating to below investment grade until the bitter end. The rating agencies argue that had they downgraded Enron sooner, they would have simply pushed the company into bankruptcy earlier. Here's a flash: So what? Moody's and S&P have one basic job--assessing risk for investors. If they couldn't penetrate Enron's complex financial engineering, the rating agencies should have said so.   The business press, including BusinessWeek, did no better. It celebrated Skilling's vision of Enron as a virtual company that could securitize anything and trade it anywhere. The press blithely accepted Enron as the epitome of a new, post-deregulation corporate model when it should have been much more aggressive in probing the company's opaque partnerships, off balance sheet maneuvers, and soaring leverage. TRAGIC. Enron's fall is made all the more tragic because of the pain inflicted on its thousands of employees. Not only are many losing their jobs, but some 12,000 are also losing most of their retirement savings. In perhaps its most egregious risk-management error, employees mostly held Enron stock in their 401(k)s, yet the company prevented them from selling until they reached the age of 54. People could only watch as the stock plummeted from $89 to a dollar. Diversification, particularly in retirement accounts, is the cardinal rule in managing risk. Enron broke that rule, as have other companies.   Enron's tale is a clarifying event. It reveals key weaknesses in the financial system that must be corrected as the U.S. moves forward in the 21st century. If America is to have an equity culture in which individuals invest in stocks and provide the capital for fast economic growth, the market must be able to correctly value companies. This requires making financial data readily available and easily comprehensible.   To restore public confidence, several steps should be taken. After accounting disasters at MicroStrategy, Cendant, Lucent, Cisco, and Waste Management, it is clear that self-regulation is not working. Conflicts of interest within auditing firms remain widespread. Investors can ignore analysts on TV who work for investment firms. But someone has to play the role of the honest watchdog. Unless the Big Five auditing firms clean up their act, they will wind up with a federally chartered oversight body. It is equally clear that current standard accounting rules aren't sufficient. Loopholes allowed Enron to fool everyone, making a mockery of public disclosure.   Regulators should also insist that corporations give their employees choice in their 401(k)s. Some 30% of assets held in 1.5 million 401(k) plans are in the stock of the company sponsoring the plan. This lack of diversification puts too many people at risk.   In the end, the Enron story is about a secretive corporate culture that failed in its primary business mission: to manage risk. Had the Federal Reserve and other central banks not flooded the global economy with liquidity in recent months, Enron's collapse could have posed a deep threat to the financial markets. It's past time to fix the system.

His e-mail address is sloan@panix.com.    12/17/2001  Newsweek   48  Copyright (C) 2001 Newsweek Inc. All Rights Reserved.     Enron corp. used to talk about becoming the world's biggest company. Instead, it became the world's biggest corporate failure, filing for bankruptcy last week. The company, which used complexity to its advantage on the way up, became a victim of its own complex dealmaking on the way down. A NEWSWEEK examination of Enron's filings shows that the company's fatal mistake was an unintended byproduct of one such deal. The transaction first inflated Enron's reportednet worth, then deflated it. When the company cleaned up its books this fall, it triggered the $1.2 billion net-worth write-down that touched off the downward spiral that led to bankruptcy.   Enron looked like a well-oiled machine, but a lot of it seems to have been jury-rigged. The company was housed in a spiffy 50-story building in downtown Houston, a structure whose elevators flashed Enron's latest stock price and delivered upbeat messages to get employees pumped by the time they got to their offices. In the best New Economy tradition, Enron had an on-site health club, casual dress and employees piling up paper wealth by investing in Enron stock.  But when things started going bad, Enron couldn't cope. It couldn't even fire people properly. Information-technology specialist Diana Peters says her entire department was told to clear out on half an hour's notice and to call their office voice mail to see if they should return to work the next day. Very classy. \"I was crying, a lot of people were crying,\" says Peters, 51. \"It reminded me of a mass funeral.\"   The company even had trouble going broke. Normally, a company hoards cash in preparation for bankruptcy by accelerating collections from its customers and slowing down payments to vendors. Enron didn't start doing that until a few days before the filing, far too late. Enron almost became the Flying Dutchman of the bankruptcy world. It wanted to file in Wilmington, Dela., but the bankruptcy court there didn't want the case. So Enron ended up in New York City. And it was so short of cash that it had to scurry around to line up $1.5 billion of so-called debtor-in-possession financing to keep the place operating. Normally, you make DIP arrangements before you file.   It would be lots of fun to give you Washington's take on all this, Enron being famous for close ties to the White House and the Republican Party. But we'll leave that for another day, because the juicy stuff probably won't show up until the Democrats get in gear. Hearings in the Republican-controlled House are set for this week, and will focus on accounting and stock analysts and the Securities and Exchange Commission rather than on Enron's political relationships and what, if anything, the White House did during Enron's final days.   Although some details are still murky, one thing is clear: Arthur Andersen, Enron's outside accountant, is in big trouble, and it (or its insurers) will have to fork over big bucks. Andersen's big problem stems from a company called JEDI--as in \"Star Wars\"--that Enron now says should have been on its books since 1997. Andersen allowed JEDI to remain off the books for years. The other deal, involving a company called Raptor, caused the net-worth disappearance that set Enron on the road to ruin.   JEDI stands for Joint Energy Development Investments. It was a partnership between Enron and the California state-employees' pension fund, known as Cal-pers. The Force was with Enron, which invested the money--$250 million each from itself and Calpers--in power plants, energy stocks and such, making more than 20 percent a year. Pretty neat. In late 1997, Calpers was willing to invest $500 million in a new partnership, JEDI 2. But it wanted to first cash in its JEDI 1 chips, worth $383 million. Instead of just liquidating JEDI, Enron got cute. (I'm not sure why. Enron declined to comment.) It went looking for an outsider to fork over $383 million and take Calpers's place. Enter something called Chewco Investments--as in Chewbacca of \"Star Wars\" fame. Chewco was a partnership of Enron employees and some undisclosed outsiders. (Who they are and how much they made is a mystery, because Chewco is a private entity.) Chewco's investors didn't have a spare $383 million. So Enron lent Chewco $132 million and guaranteed a $240 million loan that Chewco took out elsewhere. Enron was thus at risk for its own JEDI stake and essentially all of Chewco's. That being the case, it's a mystery why Andersen let Enron keep JEDI off its books. Accounting experts who have looked at this transaction, which Enron disclosed last month, just shake their heads. Andersen has refused to comment, saying it's too early to reach conclusions. Enron has restated its earnings dating back to 1997 because it says JEDI should have been on its books since then. Guess what? The restated profits are far lower than the original ones.   Now, to the deals that sank Enron. As in JEDI, Enron won't comment. These transactions involve four companies called Raptor. It looks like the Raptors were set up to let Enron use financial gymnastics to get gains from stocks it owned without actually selling them. The major holdings were Rhythms Net Connections, a now bankrupt start-up telecom company, and NewPower Holdings, which competes with established power companies for customers. At their height, Enron's stake in these companies totaled about $2 billion. Friday's value: about $40 million. Enron won't say why it didn't just sell the stock and take its profits. The most logical explanation is tax avoidance.   Now, the key to Enron's undoing. The company committed to put $1.2 billion of Enron stock into the Raptors to make them more creditworthy. It didn't promise a fixed number of shares--it promised $1.2 billion worth, regardless of the share price. A seriously dumb move for a company that talks about hedging risks. In return for that commitment, the Raptors gave Enron $1.2 billion of promissory notes. Enron put them on its balance sheet as an asset. When a company adds to its assets and nothing else changes, its net worth rises. Hence, Enron marked up its net worth by $1.2 billion.   But as the stock prices of Rhythms, NewPower and Enron all sank, Enron faced having to fork over a ruinous number of new shares. So Enron paid $35 million to the Raptors' outside investors--yet another mysterious partnership--and liquidated the Raptors. That eliminated the notes, which eliminated the aforementioned $1.2 billion from Enron's net worth. That set off the now famous October run on Enron's credit, which ultimately led to bankruptcy. Now, far too late, Enron says it shouldn't have counted the notes as assets.   The bottom line: numbers matter. So does truth. Enron was too clever by half. And that's a good way to end up looking stupid.

The video (that can be used during refreshment time & is the basis of our Friday evening program) features Chatter the Chipmunk -- so we could reuse the adorable costume Ann Turney made.  I would like to select the curriculum with you guys before we have our volunteer luncheon (which I would like to do in late Feb or early March).   I would also like to agree on the date in mid-late July for VBS.  I think I currently have 2 weeks penciled on the church calendar.  I also have ordered samples of Group's Children's Church curriculum.  I have been struggling lately with inspiration for new lessons and some pre-prepared lessons might help us draw in additional volunteers.  Most of our volunteers are enthusiastic about helping -- but not preparing -- a children's church worship.    Evening meetings are difficult for me right now -- as there is much to do in the evenings and little time.  I would love to meet sometime this weekend if you are available.  (Kim will be out of the country the first few weekends in Feb.) or I can meet on Fri. Feb 1 or Fri. Feb 8  - if either of those days suit.",

Here's the catch -- neither has service from Moscow.  So I'll be out of lunch in Moscow unless I can find an alternative ISP.     I'm at regional type hotels in Kazakstan.

We received our INS approval to adopt Alina, but with court date delays etc., it looks like our most likely travel time is late November or early December.  When I get a little better info.  I will make Children's Church plans.  If it turns out that I'm gone several weeks in December, then perhaps we can talk Patty into letting the kids sit in regular church during Advent.  It is always such a fun time for them to be in church & they recognize so many of the songs.  If I'm only going to be gone in late Dec & first week of Dec, then we can probably continue with Children's church as planned.

		"_body" : " GISB IS NOW NAESB GISB is now officially NAESB.  (The actual pronunciation is still undetermined!!!)  I may unintentionally go back and forth between the names -- my apologies in advance.  Also, some things are still officially 'GISB', such as the operating practices.  There is still transition work to be done.  At times it's a bit confusing and has already come up during a subcommittee meeting.  I'm working to keep up with everything in NAESB, at least for a while, to watch for things that affect our quadrant and our processes. AGA is hosting two meetings in January in Washington, D.C. to discuss the retail gas and retail electric quadrants. Numerous meetings are being held by organizations such as NERC.  These are being held in response to the FERC order issued December 19 (RM01-12), which addresses standards development for the wholesale electric industry.  If the industry does not agree on a single standards development organization for wholesale electric standards by March 15, 2002, the FERC will either choose one or develop the standards themselves.  GISB (NAESB) UPDATE MEETINGS Due to current events at Enron and then the holidays, I haven't held these meetings on a regular basis.  I'm working on a regular schedule of meetings.  People have said they want these to continue and prefer them to written updates.  They want to know what's going on in GISB, including what's happening with NAESB.  NOPR ON GISB VERSION 1.5 STANDARDS I'll work with Nancy Bagot on our comments (due February 1). The El Paso pipelines will probably comment on standard 5.3.2 (the FERC asked for comments on whether they should adopt GISB's revisions).  They will also get with INGAA to begin coordination of INGAA's comments. I'll let you know what I hear from other pipelines or other companies.  GISB VERSION 1.5 Assuming the FERC adopts the version 1.5 standards, the implementation date for the title transfer tracking (TTT) standards is April 18, 2002.  I'll work with the pipelines to ensure we're ready.  As I recall, we've been in compliance with the proposed standards for a while.  It would be a good idea to double check. The implementation date for the remainder of the standards could be as early as June 1, 2002. I'm working to determine the best way to update our copy of the version 1.5 standards to incorporate the corrections noted in the errata.  It is very unlikely that GISB will correct the standards books.  Other than the pipelines, none of the EC representatives have voiced a concern or an interest in having the books corrected.  It will be difficult for our people (business and technical) to use separate documents (the standards books and the errata) when implementing.  And, it will create greater opportunities for error.  TRANSACTIONAL REPORTING I'm working with the IR chairs to finalize the data sets.  Next, Technical will develop code values to be used on our Web sites.  The data sets will then be sent to the EC for vote (EBB implementation only at this time) and will probably be included in version 1.6, scheduled for publication on July 31, 2002.  Technical will develop the EDI implementation guides, which will be part of a later publication.  INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS ENA has said that they will not continue to chair IR.  They may try to participate.  This leaves IR with only one chair.  Dale Davis and I are filling in the gap.  I'm not chairing any meetings -- I'm only helping outside the meetings.  We have a candidate in mind for IR chair and we're working to bring him up to speed as quickly as possible.  The current chair still is not working out, but the new chair should be able to handle the position and run IR.  The better job the IR chairs do, the less I have to do. We are also working on a few of IR's processes.  This will help to avoid another errata situation like the one we have with version 1.5.  The more complete IR's work product is, the less the NAESB office has to handle it and, therefore, the less they can mess it up.  GISB PUBLICATION PROCESS The task force that is working on the publication process (PPRTF) is picking up speed again (after the holidays).  This group is addressing not only the publication process, but also the approval process for standards.  We meet via conference call every Tuesday and Friday for 1/2 day.  Our work product is due to the EC in time for their February 2002 meeting.  As with IR, the results should help avoid another massive errata, as we have for version 1.5. ",

In addition to the usual comments, the FERC is requesting comments on whether they should adopt the revisions to the capacity release timeline (5.3.2).  I spoke with Joe Hartsoe.  I feel we should comment in favor of adopting 5.3.2.  The timing is preferable to the FERC's findings in the CIG order, etc.  Parties such as the LDCs (Mike Novak) may see this as an opportunity to renege on the consensus agreements made in GISB.  Most of the pipeline EC reps are still out for the holidays -- I haven't been able to find out whether they will comment.  I'll work on this next week.  The FERC is also proposing to eliminate existing section 284.12(a), which deals with EBBs.  They've noted this is clean-up of the regulations.  Similar requirements for Internet communications are contained in other regs.  I'll check the regs and let you know what I find.  There probably won't be any need to comment on this.  Comments are due February 1.  Nancy Bagot will coordinate our comments.  I'll work with her.  Implementation date is three months after a final rule is issued.  Thanks, Theresa",

GLATER  01/10/2002 The New York Times Page 1, Column 3 c. 2002 New York Times Company<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" />  Widening the potential scope of the criminal investigation into the Enron Corporation, the Justice Department plans to form a special task force of prosecutors from across the country to conduct the inquiry into the company and its eventual collapse, government officials said yesterday.   At the same time, the decision will reduce the burdens going forward on Enron, which has been struggling with the demands from multiple civil and criminal investigations. By consolidating the criminal investigations, the company will have only one coordinated group of prosecutors seeking information, decreasing the potential demands for documents and limiting the number of officials to persuade of its position.  Legal experts said the decision to create such a task force on a white-collar case involving a single company was virtually unheard-of and signaled that the government might elevate the case to a level of significance usually reserved for investigations of entire industries.   The task force will bring together prosecutors from several United States attorneys' offices -- including those in Houston, New York City and San Francisco -- with all of them reporting through the department's criminal division, officials said. In addition, prosecutors from the fraud section, part of the criminal division, will be part of the task force.   ''This is a case of national scope and national significance that is going to require coordination and manpower, and the task force is a way of achieving that,'' one official said.   Robert S. Bennett, a Washington lawyer who represents the company, said last night that he saw the department's decision as positive. ''I'm pleased that there now appears to be some centralization and coordination, because it is very difficult and expensive to deal with half a dozen different entities,'' he said. ''This is a company in bankruptcy, and it needs to be given a fair shot to come out of bankruptcy and increase the value for stakeholders. If we get caught in a cumbersome scandal machine, that may not happen.''   While the decision to form the task force is final, many details have yet to be worked out, officials said. Some prosecutors involved in the case have not been notified of their specific roles in the task force, and other decisions about where the group will work and how the various strands of investigation will be coordinated have not been determined.   The Justice Department has formed numerous task forces in the past, but they have usually focused either on complex cases of violent crime or conducted inquiries into practices by entire industries.   Legal experts who have examined the Enron case said yesterday that by bringing together the disparate pieces of the sprawling criminal investigation of the company, the government is overcoming hurdles that might have hampered the inquiry if it was conducted in separate offices.   For example, while federal prosecutors in Manhattan have the most experience in investigating complex white-collar cases, they might face difficulty in meeting the requirement that potential crimes took place in their geographical jurisdiction. And while prosecutors in Houston, where Enron is based, would have no such problems, they do not have the same experience in white-collar cases.   By bringing the prosecutors together, while simultaneously adding the manpower from the department's fraud section, legal experts said, the government is raising the probability of indictments.   ''Prosecutors tend to indict what they investigate,'' said John C. Coffee Jr., a law professor at Columbia University who has testified in Congress on the Enron case. ''This kind of task force for an individual investigation is without precedent, and while it doesn't guarantee an indictment, it certainly raises the stakes.''   But some past efforts by the Justice Department to take a more central role in a criminal investigation of a corporation with influence in Washington have raised concerns about potential political influence over the inquiry. For example, in the 1990's, when part of an inquiry involving the Archer Daniels Midland Company was assigned to the fraud section, some critics contended -- to the vehement denials of Justice officials -- that Washington was trying to protect Archer, the politically influential grain company. Enron, whose officers have been close to both President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney, has exercised similar political influence in the past.   In addition to the inquiry being conducted by the Justice Department, Enron's collapse is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and several Congressional committees.   Meanwhile, in Enron's bankruptcy proceedings, parts of the company are now up for auction to the highest bidder. For example, an auction of its trading business is scheduled to take place today, and a spokeswoman said it should be presented to the bankruptcy court at a hearing tomorrow. But a speedy approval by the court is not assured. Several creditors have filed objections to the auction because they are worried that they will not have time to evaluate whether all or parts of the business will be sold at a fair price.   Creditors have also expressed concern about what would happen to the proceeds from the sale. Creditors of Enron North America, the unit that owns the trading business, want to make sure that the money goes to them and is not distributed among all the company's creditors.   In Houston yesterday, in a suit filed by investors against 29 Enron directors and officers, a federal judge dealt a setback to plaintiffs by declining to freeze more than $1 billion that they say the directors and officers gained from the sale of Enron shares while hiding information about the company's decline. However, the judge also told defendants that she had the power to freeze the assets if necessary.     Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.      U.S. Puts Task Force on Criminal Probe of Enron By Rebecca Smith Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal  01/10/2002 The Wall Street Journal A3 (Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  The Justice Department said a task force has been formed to pursue a criminal investigation of Enron Corp., confirming a probe that is expected to center on possible accounting fraud.   The investigation will be run by the department's criminal division coordinating among U.S. Attorneys in New York City, San Francisco, Houston and elsewhere. The Wall Street Journal first reported the criminal investigation in early December.  Enron, the nation's biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas, filed for bankruptcy-court protection following a crisis of confidence among its investors. The problems have resulted largely from Enron's dealings with private partnerships, run by some of its own executives. The company saw its market value plunge recently to about $540 million from more than $77 billion last year.   The Securities and Exchange Commission, which has been investigating Enron since October, and the Justice Department could both file cases alleging violations of securities laws if Enron is found to have intentionally misled investors about its financial condition. Several Congressional committees also have begun inquiries into various aspects of Enron's collapse.   Enron acknowledged that it is the target of a criminal investigation by the Justice Department. \"It has been the posture of the company to fully cooperate with government investigations,\" said Robert Bennett, an attorney with Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, which represents the company. \"At the end of day, I'm pretty optimistic . . . an objective person will see that many of the things said and written [about Enron] aren't true.\"   Confirmation of the probe came even as nearly two dozen firms asked a U.S. bankruptcy-court judge to temporarily block Enron's intended sale of its energy-trading business, until recently the earnings juggernaut for the entire company.   The court approved an auction process on Dec. 19 that was to have resulted in the announcement of the winning bidder as early as tomorrow.   Bidders for pieces of Enron's energy-trading business, which still has a staff of about 1,000 people, include Citigroup Inc., UBS AG and BP PLC, people familiar with the matter have said.   But a host of creditors have asked the court to delay the sale indefinitely. The list includes financial institutions such as Royal Bank of Scotland PLC and GE Capital Corp. as well as power-trading rivals such as Mirant Corp., El Paso Merchant Energy LP and Aquila Inc., a unit of Utilicorp United Inc.   Aquila said it doesn't oppose the sale, per se, but wants guarantees that Enron will put the proceeds in an escrow account until a determination has been made about how it will be split among creditors.   Mirant, Atlanta, in its pleadings with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, said the sales materials circulated by Enron lacked \"significant material information that is essential . . . to make an informed decision regarding the wisdom of the transaction.\"   The materials lack a minimum bid, which \"begs the question,\" Mirant said, \"as to whether there is a bid that is simply too low to accept or whether the debtors are preparing to sell at any price.\" Challengers also questioned who would be responsible for liabilities excluded from the sale.   Enron's energy-marketing unit, which includes its once-mighty EnronOnline Internet-based trading platform, traded dozens of products until recently and generated roughly 90% of the firm's earnings in the most recent quarter. It also was responsible for the bulk of Enron's 2001 revenue of $101 billion.   In bankruptcy-court documents filed in December, Enron said the company's wholesale-trading business, of which the energy-trading unit is a major part, had assets of about $13 billion and liabilities of at least $8 billion.   Concerns over Enron's financial strength and the integrity of its accounting practices caused trading partners to back away from doing business with it starting in mid-October. From that point on, a significant portion of Enron's trading volume came from customers trying to wind down their Enron-related positions. The unit ceased meaningful operations prior to Enron's Dec. 2 bankruptcy-court filing.   Resuscitation will require a cash infusion from a trusted partner with a blue-chip credit rating, the company has said. It has proposed transferring assets to a new venture in which Enron would retain a 49% position. The new investor would control the partnership, that has been dubbed New Energy Trading Company LP.   An Enron spokesman said the firm would press to go ahead with the proposal. \"It's in the best interest of Enron and its creditors to get the trading operation started as soon as possible to get as much value for the estate as possible,\" said spokesman Mark Palmer.

Attorneys from the Justice Department's fraud section, along with prosecutors from Houston, New York and San Francisco among other cities, will form a special task force to examine the collapse of the nation's seventh-largest company, a Justice official confirmed Wednesday.   The energy and trading giant sought protection from its creditors on Dec. 2, becoming the largest bankruptcy case in U.S. corporate history.   For weeks, the Justice Department has been known to be looking into the Enron debacle, as have the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Labor Department and a host of congressional panels.   \"This is basically an issue of national scope,\" said the Justice official, who asked not to be identified. \"Because there have been so many questions about this and because there has been so much interest, we are simply acknowledging the investigation.\"   Robert Bennett, a Washington-based attorney representing Enron in the nation's capital, argued the Justice Department's action is actually \"a positive development.\"   \"There will be a unification and a structure to the investigation,\" Bennett said. \"We won't have to deal with six or seven different offices.\"   Since the company's dizzying fall, Enron has been overwhelmed by a blizzard of lawsuits, investigations and subpoenas.   On Wednesday, the Senate Banking Committee became the sixth congressional panel to jump into the swirl of Enron investigations.   Responding to fiascoes at companies such as Enron and Houston trash hauler Waste Management, the committee, headed by Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., plans to hold a hearing Feb. 12 to examine accounting and investor protections.   Waste Management, which was accused of inflating corporate earnings, agreed in November to pay $457 million to settle a class-action suit. Andersen, Waste Management's auditor, agreed to pay a $7 million SEC fine and another $20 million to Waste Management shareholders for failing to catch the company's accounting excesses.   Sarbanes' committee plans to call five former SEC heads to suggest ways to avoid future debacles.   \"Enron is not the sole focus of the hearing,\" said Sarbanes' spokesman, Jesse Jacobs.   Lawmakers have been clamoring for Enron Chief Executive Ken Lay and other Enron executives to appear before their panels, and they have vowed to subpoena them unless they agree to come voluntarily.   Lay has promised to appear Feb. 4 before the Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Affairs.   The House Energy and Commerce Committee has collected thousands of pages of documents and interviewed a number of current and former Enron officials.   Prior to the company's collapse, Lay, a longtime supporter of President Bush, was one of the most politically influential businessmen in America with relatively easy access to the Bush White House.   On Tuesday, Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., released a letter from Vice President Dick Cheney's office detailing six meetings between Enron executives and White House officials over an eight-month period.   \"The Washington scandal machine is being pumped up, and everybody for their own reasons wants a piece of the action,\" said Bennett, who represented former President Clinton in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case.   \"There's an unfortunate rush to judgment here,\" Bennett said. \"Hopefully, people will calm down a little bit and let these investigations proceed.\"   Enron's breathtaking collapse began in October, when the company revealed that $1.2 billion worth of shareholder equity had evaporated, largely because of the accounting treatment of some off-balance-sheet joint ventures.   That news shook investor confidence in the company and began a free-fall of the company's stock.   Joseph Berardino, head of Enron's outside auditor Andersen, told a House panel last month Enron officials failed to provide examiners with required information and may have committed \"possible illegal acts.\"   Enron employees and retirees have complained loudly about the loss of retirement funds because of the company's collapse. Participants in the company's 401(k) retirement plan were barred from selling their Enron shares just as the stock was nosediving because of management's decision to change plan administrators.   The Justice Department's revelation about the criminal investigation task force comes just as Enron is scheduled today to hold an auction for a majority stake in the company's most lucrative operation, its trading business.   Three firms, including Citigroup and UBS Warburg, submitted proposals Monday to take control of the trading operation. Other companies could join the bidding today in what industry analysts say could be a billion-dollar transaction.         Justice Department begins criminal probe of Enron collapse By KAREN GULLO Associated Press Writer  01/10/2002 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2002. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.  WASHINGTON (AP) - The Justice Department has begun a criminal investigation of Enron Corp., the bankrupt energy company whose collapse caused many employees to lose their life's savings.   An attorney for Enron welcomed the inquiry, the latest in a series of governmental probes into the company's demise, saying the investigation would \"bring light to the facts.\"  \"We want to get to the bottom of this too,\" said Robert Bennett, a Washington attorney representing the Houston-based company. \"A lot of decent and honorable people work at Enron and we should wait until the facts are out.\"   The Justice Department is forming a national task force to look into the company's dealings. The group will be headed by lawyers at the department's criminal division and include prosecutors in Houston, San Francisco, New York and several other cities, said a Justice Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity.   The official declined to say when the investigation began. Enron faces civil investigations by the Labor Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission and subpoenas from congressional committees.   All are looking into the energy trading company's collapse, the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history.   The failure hit employees and investors hard. Workers were prohibited from selling company stock from their Enron-heavy 401(k) retirement accounts as the company's stock plummeted. Many lost their life's savings.   Enron executives cashed out more than $1 billion in stock when it was near its peak.   Formed in 1985, Enron had 20,000 employees and was once the world's top buyer and seller of natural gas and the largest electricity marketer in the United States. It also marketed coal, pulp, paper, plastics, metals and fiber-optic bandwidth.   One likely focus of the Justice Department investigation is possible fraud based on Enron's heavy reliance on off-balance-sheet partnerships which took on Enron debt. The partnerships masked Enron's financial problems and left its credit ratings healthy so it could obtain the cash and credit crucial to running its trading business.   The Houston-based company went bankrupt after its credit collapsed and its main rival, Dynegy Inc., backed out of an $8.4 billion buyout plan late last year.   Just a year ago, stock of the nation's largest buyer and seller of natural gas traded at $85 per share. Today it is less than $1.   Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay has close ties to President Bush and his father, former President Bush. Lay was a top contributor to the younger Bush's 2000 presidential campaign.   Last week, the president said: \"I think the life savings issue is something we need to look into. ... The government will be looking into this.\"   Lay also gave $25,000 to a leadership committee headed by then-senator and now Attorney General John Ashcroft, according to the Center for Public Integrity.   The company played a key role earlier this year when a White House task force met with business executives and other interests to fashion a national energy policy. The task force was headed by Vice President Dick Cheney.   The White House has acknowledged that Enron representatives met six times with Cheney or his aides on energy issues last year, most recently in mid-October just before the investing public realized the company was heading for disaster.   The vice president's office said the last Enron meeting with a Cheney aide was Oct. 10, just six days before the first in a series of public admissions by the company about its true financial condition that sent it careening into bankruptcy court.   Enron's financial position wasn't discussed in any of the meetings, vice presidential counsel David Addington said in a letter.   On Wednesday, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer told reporters: \"I'm not aware of anybody in the White House who discussed Enron's financial situation.\"   ---   On the Net:   http://www.Enron.com   http://usdoj.gov     AP Photo NY836  Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Jan. 10, 2002, 12:23AM   Judge declines to freeze profits of Enron officers    By TOM FOWLER  Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle  A federal judge said Wednesday she has the authority to freeze hundreds of millions of dollars in assets that Enron Corp. insiders earned through selling their stock, but declined to do so.   U.S. District Court Judge Lee Rosenthal cited a 1999 Supreme Court opinion for her authority to freeze the assets of the 29 Enron executives and board members named in a lawsuit filed on behalf of a number of worker retirement funds. But she ruled there were insufficient grounds for issuing such an order based on the evidence and arguments she has heard so far.   In her ruling Rosenthal wrote she would not order the restraining order on the assets \" ... without allegations or evidence that each, or any, defendant has, or is likely to, conceal the stock sales proceeds or profits or place them beyond reach, absent immediate judicial intervention.\"   Enron officials were not immediately available for comment.   The lawsuit, filed by New York-based Amalgamated Bank in November, alleges that Enron executives and board members sold $1.1 billion in Enron stock over the past three years while not disclosing that the stock price was overvalued. Amalgamated Bank manages pension funds that hold Enron stock.   The lawsuit claims the company officials were aware of accounting problems that led to inflated earnings reports and higher stock prices.   In November 2001, Enron reported it was adjusting its earnings for the past 4 1/2 years because of bookkeeping errors related to investment partnerships it had formed. That included a $586 million reduction in net income, adding $2.5 billion in debt to its books and a 77-cent reduction in earnings per share.   \"We are gratified that we have cleared this important legal hurdle,\" said Amalgamated's attorney Bill Lerach in a statement Wednesday. \"We are also pleased that the court has held open the possibility that we may conduct discovery to obtain additional evidence to justify the requested injunction.\"   In a Dec. 7 hearing, Lerach asked the judge to freeze the assets of the Enron insiders, including Chairman and CEO Ken Lay and former Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling, claiming there was a danger they would flee the country with the profits from exercising their stock options. Lay netted $16.1 million in stock sales for the first nine months of 2001, according to data compiled by Thomson Financial/First Call, while Skilling collected $15.5 million.   Attorneys representing Enron denied that their clients would do so and challenged the court's authority to freeze assets.   In her ruling this week, Rosenthal ordered Amalgamated to file a brief in support of its request for expedited discovery into the case by Jan. 23 and for Enron and its executives to file a response by Feb. 6.     VIEWPOINTS White House Was a Home For Enron Robert Reno  01/10/2002 Newsday ALL EDITIONS A36 (Copyright Newsday Inc., 2002)  PRESIDENT George W. Bush says he's had \"no contact with Enron officials in the last six weeks.\"   That's a relief. It shows he has sense enough to know when a corporation has turned radioactive and is best approached at the end of a 10-foot pole. Still, this leaves almost an entire year in which Enron officials waltzed in and out of the White House enjoying an unusual degree of access. The Washington Post reports that Vice President Dick Cheney or his aides found time to meet with Enron officials on six occasions in 2001.  On the face of it, this may not even seem excessive for an administration in which corporate interests have been given an extraordinary degree of influence. And besides, David S. Addington, the vice president's counsel, wrote a letter insisting that \"Enron did not communicate information about its financial position in any of the meetings with the vice president or with the National Energy Development Group's support staff.\"   That's a relief as well. Since Enron's financial troubles weren't discussed, this presumably shows Enron wasn't looking for some squalid favor that would permit it to avoid one of the most spectacular bankruptcies in history.   It was probably just seeking to influence some government action that would advance the general interests of Enron, perhaps relief from some obnoxious regulation promulgated in the Clinton administration that stood between Enron and its ambitions to become the world's largest corporation. And in the energy-friendly Bush administration, what more logical place to come than the White House?   Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) can be forgiven his cynicism about these Enron meetings. He said, \"It shows Enron far exceeded the access provided by the White House to other parties interested in energy policy.\" Certainly, it exceeds the access that would be granted to, say, a bunch of high-minded old ladies in hand-knitted sweaters pleading against a rape of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Anyway, White House officials said the Enron meetings reflected nothing more sinister than the \"open and inclusive\" policy of the vice president's energy task force. They made it sound like all the meetings had taken place in plain sight on the White lawn.   Anyway, the Enron meetings continued until just days before the company started to collapse. Cheney's aides met with executives of Enron's German subsidiary on Aug. 7 and with Enron officials on Oct. 10. Six days later, Enron's troubles became news, and the shell of its assets became transparent to the world.   A little more than a month later, Enron announced $55 million in bonuses to 500 key employees. Another 4,000 employees got pink slips and $4,500 in severance pay to console them for 401(k) balances that had become close to worthless because the bulk of it was in Enron shares.   This gave off an odor of favoritism until it was explained that somebody had to be induced to stay around and pick over the bones of Enron's carcass for what assets could be preserved. The $55 million began to look like a small price to pay for this, considering that last year the corporation had $101 billion in sales.     Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The White House on Wednesday said it was likely to soon propose new policies to guard against a repeat of the bankruptcy of Enron Corp., which has prompted a Justice Department criminal probe.   White House spokesman Ari Fleischer, asked about the probe, told Reuters it was important to get to the bottom of the Enron collapse and develop new policies to protect workers and pensioners.  \"It's important for the investigation to proceed to determine what was done and why it was done. The president also believes it's important to explore new policies so it (a similar collapse) can never happen again,\" Fleischer said.   Asked whether new policies would be announced soon, he said, \"likely.\"     Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   USA: Enron creditors gearing up for haggling at auction. By Dane Hamilton  01/09/2002 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2002.  NEW YORK, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Creditors of Enron Corp. have shifted into high gear in anticipation of an expected intense day of haggling Thursday when the bankrupt energy company auctions off its trading operations.   So far, two financial bidders, Citicorp Inc. and UBS Warburg , have submitted bids for the Houston-based company's biggest business, sources said. But both Enron and creditors are hoping other companies may jump into the fray for all or parts of Enron's electricity and gas trading operations.  To take part, a bidder needs only to submit a sealed bid and a certified check for $25 million, to be returned if the bid is not chosen. British oil giant BP Plc , for instance, said it is interested in a small part, but not all, of Enron's trading operations, but left the door open to enlarge its bid later.   The auction is set to take place at 10 a.m. at the New York office of Enron's attorneys, Weil Gotshal & Manges. Enron lawyers will evaluate bids with a 15-member unsecured creditors committee and could present its recommendations to U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Arthur Gonzales Friday.   Enron, once the world's biggest energy trading company, is seeking a well-heeled backer to take a controlling stake in the Enron trading operations and guarantee contracts.   The company, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Dec. 2, is aiming to revive the moribund trading operations to generate cash to pay off creditors. It is hoping eventually to emerge from the debt shield under Chapter 11, a prospect that can take months or years.   Thursday's auction is likely to be a drawn-out affair, where negotiators will likely pressure bidders to sweeten offers by playing them off against each other.   \"This is not like Sothebys,\" said one member of Enron's unsecured creditors committee, a panel chosen by a U.S. Bankruptcy Court trustee to represent the interests of banks, bondholders and other stakeholders in Enron. \"It could go on all day and conceivably into the night.\"   This committee member, who asked for anonymity, said Enron lawyers and the committee could agree on a bidder or ask for more time. Or they could decide Enron is better off keeping the business.   A key point of discussions this week was the distribution of the proceeds of cash flow from a revival of Enron's trading operation, which generated the bulk of Enron's $95 billion in 2000 revenue in wholesale services, by far its largest division, people familiar with the discussions said.   But these people denied news reports that characterized the discussions as a dispute with Enron and said any issues are likely to be resolved in a way that will not hold up the auction.   \"This is a very extreme and inaccurate statement of fact to suggest there is a dispute,\" said one creditor representative. \"We are undertaking due diligence to support the right action. That is what we are supposed to be doing as a creditors committee.\"   Another committee member said creditors have asked for more information on the nature and extent of the bids on the table. But this member said there is a general agreement to resolve the issues as soon as possible.   \"I don't think we have enough information now as to whether we should endorse this sale,\" said this member.   But he said there is agreement to expedite the sale in the hopes of reviving Enron's most valuable operation.   \"The longer you wait, the staler the trading operation becomes,\" he said.   This member said there have been objections filed in the U.S. bankruptcy court to the sale of the trading operations. But those objections were filed before any bids came in. He said it seemed \"questionable\" to object to a sale that may benefit the bankrupt company's estate without knowing the offer.     Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   USA: UPDATE 1-GAO to decide within month on White House suit. By Susan Cornwell  01/09/2002 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2002.  WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Congress' investigative arm said on Wednesday he would decide within a month whether to sue the White House over its refusal to name industry executives the administration met with last year while drafting its new energy policy.   Comptroller General David Walker had been heading for a court clash with the administration last year, but postponed a decision after the Sept. 11 hijack attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.  Now, any decision by him to sue would add to Capitol Hill's scrutiny of the collapsed energy giant, Enron , whose executives the White House has acknowledged consulting while drawing up its energy plan.   Citing the right of Congress to oversee the executive branch, Walker, head of the General Accounting Office, began trying last May to get details of the workings of the administration task force that drew up the energy program.   Environmental groups say they were mostly shut out of the sessions of the task force, which was headed by Vice President Dick Cheney. They suspect private sector experts such as Enron heavily influenced the Bush energy plan.   Enron was a major backer of Bush's election campaign, Bush himself is a former oil man, and Cheney was formerly head of Halliburton Co. , the world's No. 1. oilfield services company.   The policy announced by Bush in May urged more oil and gas drilling and a revived nuclear power program. But the White House says it consulted widely in its energy policy review.   And the White House largely rebuffed the GAO's efforts to get the information about the National Energy Policy Development Group (NEPDG), as the task force was called.   \"I expect to make a decision on whether to file suit regarding GAO's access to NEPDG records within a month,\" Walker said in a brief statement on Wednesday.   Walker began his probe of the energy task force after Rep. Henry Waxman and Rep. John Dingell, both Democrats, asked him to investigate.   ENRON DRAWS SCRUTINY   Recently the energy task force controversy had seemed to all but evaporate. Then last month Waxman seized on the spectacular collapse of Enron to write to Cheney's office again and ask what contacts the task force had with Enron.   The White House said in a letter released on Tuesday that Cheney or the energy task force staff met six times with Enron representatives last year.   Walker's spokesman Jeff Nelligan refused to be say whether the White House's revelations about Enron - or the five congressional committees probing Enron - made a GAO lawsuit over the energy task force more or less likely.   In any case, Waxman is seeking more information from the White House about its Enron contacts. White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said on Wednesday the vice president's office was reviewing the new request from Waxman.   \"I'm not aware of anybody in the White House who discussed Enron's financial situation,\" Fleischer added.

Editorial Desk; Section A Joined at the Hip By BOB HERBERT  01/10/2002 The New York Times Page 27, Column 5 c. 2002 New York Times Company  You'll have to look long and extremely hard to come up with an example of corporate treachery in the United States that's as horrible as the Enron debacle. This is a scandal with a very broad reach and it has some of the wise guys in the Bush administration and other top Republicans trembling in their penny loafers.   Enron was a bonanza for -- whom else? -- the folks at the top of the pyramid. They ferociously exploited their gilt-edged political connections and harvested breathtaking amounts of cash for themselves, even as the company was collapsing into the biggest bankruptcy mess in U.S. history. Left behind were thousands of ordinary working men and women, people with families and obligations, who lost jobs, life savings, pensions, the works. And more carnage is to come.  The fallout is nationwide. A week before Christmas, Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, spoke about the gloom that had settled over workers in his state who watched their retirement funds vanish. ''Because of what happened at Enron,'' he said, ''there are Oregon families going to grief counseling rather than holiday parties this year.''   No one knows yet the extent of the illegality -- if any -- that went on at Enron. The Justice Department announced yesterday that it was launching a criminal investigation. But there is no doubt that many of the company's top officials swam, as a matter of course, in an ethical sewer. They were pals with, and lavishly greased the palms of, powerful people who were willing to guide government policy toward Enron's ends, and who could help the company escape close scrutiny of its more sinister activities.   The Center for Public Integrity, a nonpartisan watchdog agency in Washington, examined the political contributions of 29 top Enron executives and directors named in a shareholder lawsuit filed against the company last month. Twenty-four of the 29 made contributions from 1999 to 2001 -- totaling nearly $800,000 -- to George W. Bush, members of Congress, the two national political parties (with the bulk of the contributions going to the Republicans) and a variety of officials who are now responsible for investigating possible securities fraud by Enron.   Of the five who did not make contributions, two were foreign nationals prohibited by law from contributing to candidates or parties.   ''The folks at the top of the company gave lavishly,'' said Charles Lewis, the center's executive director. ''It just shows that this is a company inordinately dependent on government favors.''   And how did these generous Enron officials behave as the apocalypse approached?   The shareholders' suit, as the center noted in its study, ''alleges that the 29 executives and directors dumped $1.1 billion worth of stock while knowing the company was in danger of collapse.''   Defendants in the lawsuit have disputed the charges against them. But there is no disputing that as Enron toppled and fell, insiders unloaded hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of stock while rank-and-file Enron employees were locked into rules that left many of them helpless as the stock's value plunged from more than $90 a share to less than $1.   It has long been known that Enron and its chairman, Kenneth Lay, were close to President Bush. In Mr. Lewis's book, ''The Buying of the President 2000,'' Enron was already listed as Mr. Bush's No. 1 career patron.   This week the office of Vice President Dick Cheney reluctantly disclosed that Enron executives met with Mr. Cheney or his aides at least six times as the Bush administration -- with Mr. Cheney in charge -- was putting together its national energy policy.   It will be interesting to find out, as this scandal continues to unfold, how aggressively the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other appropriate agencies investigate a company that has been as generous and as wired and as powerfully influential as Enron.   There's already talk that Harvey Pitt, the chairman of the S.E.C., may have to recuse himself because as a lawyer in private practice he did work for Arthur Andersen, the company that audited Enron's books with its eyes closed.   Enron is a case study in the dangers that will inevitably arise when unrestrained corporate greed is joined at the hip with the legalized bribery and influence-peddling that passes for government these days.     Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.      California Commentary Compassionately Conserving Enron ARIANNA HUFFINGTON Arianna Huffington is a syndicated columnist. E-mail: arianna@ariannaonline.com.  01/10/2002 Los Angeles Times Home Edition B-15 Copyright 2002 / The Times Mirror Company  So now we know why the White House has spent the better part of a year fending off congressional efforts to find out who Vice President Dick Cheney met with for input on his energy task force. Turns out that the vice president and his staff had at least six meetings with representatives from Enron--including one with Chairman Kenneth L. Lay--the last of which occurred just six days before the company revealed that it had vastly overstated its earnings, signaling the beginning of the end for the energy giant.   Since the Enron collapse, President Bush has been acting like Lay was just some good ol' boy who also happened to hail from Texas. This new information proves otherwise: that Lay and his company's sizable political contributions had bought what Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles) has termed \"extensive access\" to the epicenter of American political power. It's Teapot Dome, the Sequel.  During his run for the White House, Bush fought long and hard to convince us that he was a new breed of conservative--a Compassionate Conservative. But recent events make clear that he is actually the standard-bearer of a far more coldhearted breed. Call them the Enron Conservatives.   Enron Conservatives are people who use political money and connections as levers to free themselves of all accountability to laws, regulations and responsibility--even to their own employees. Simply put, they are people who consistently, shamelessly and aggressively put their self-interest above the public interest. And when the lives of others are destroyed in the process, they just look the other way and hope that the law does too. And, all too often, it does.   It probably is too much to expect the Federal Trade Commission to hop on the Enron investigation bandwagon and look into whether Bush violated truth-in-labeling laws during his campaign, when his pledges of compassionate conservatism were stump speech favorites. But it should. Because we've heard precious little of them since Bush took the oath of office.   \"While many of our citizens prosper,\" the freshly anointed president said in his inaugural address a year ago, \"others doubt the promise, even the justice, of our own country.\" And those nagging doubts are only aggravated by the behavior of Enron executives who continue to prosper even as thousands watch their jobs--and their life's savings--disappear.   Candidate Bush was so eager to paint himself as a Compassionate Conservative that he even dared to impugn the moral supremacy of the free market--blasphemy in the eyes of his party's doctrinaire right wing.   \"The invisible hand works many miracles,\" said Bush during the summer of 1999, evoking Adam Smith's famous paean to market forces, \"but it cannot touch the human heart.\" This simple truth lies at the core of the need for fair and rational government regulation of industry. All too often, after all, the human heart is filled not with goodness but with greed, selfishness and a desire for profit at any cost.   Too bad Bush left this noble idea on the campaign trail. Since taking office, the hallmark of his administration has been an unwavering belief in the free market's invisible hand. In the last year, the president and his anti-regulatory appointees have (take a breath): abandoned a campaign promise to regulate carbon dioxide; repealed workplace ergonomic rules designed to improve worker safety; proposed reversing regulations protecting 60 million acres of national forest from logging and road building; and canceled a looming deadline for auto makers to develop prototype high-mileage cars. And that's just a partial list.   Not even the rapacious excesses of the Enron debacle have quelled the drive for deregulation--or the ardor of Enron Conservatives who champion the cause. Pat Wood, Lay's handpicked choice to head the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, insists that the collapse of Enron \"doesn't seem to be tied too much to deregulated energy markets.\" You know that something is rotten in Washington when the top energy industry regulator is so unabashedly anti-regulation.   Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas), chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, is another Enron Conservative who sees the energy giant's collapse as an aberration, not a smoking gun. He dismisses Enron's demise as \"an in-house problem\" and continues slaving away on a deregulation bill that would make Lay proud.   Then there's Lawrence Lindsey, the president's top economic advisor and a former advisor to Enron, who went so far as to claim that the Enron disaster \"is a tribute to American capitalism.\" And Sept. 11 was a tribute to Islamic ingenuity.   Not that long ago, Bush was vowing to battle domestic suffering with \"armies of compassion.\" Instead, he and his cadre of Enron Conservatives are adding to the carnage.

EDITORIAL EDITORIALS Cheney's closed doors  01/10/2002 The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL A.18 (Copyright 2002)  NOW THAT Enron faces a federal investigation in the wake of its largest-ever bankruptcy, it's time for Vice President Dick Cheney to explain fully his closed-door meetings with the fallen energy giant.   After a ridiculous insistence on secrecy, Cheney acknowledges that, yes, he and his advisers met with Enron before and after writing an industry-friendly report on energy. The guest list at sessions of Cheney's energy task force was kept secret, most likely to cover the oil and gas interests who prepped the White House on what to write.  The Enron-Cheney get-togethers aren't a huge surprise. Enron and its employees gave $113,800 to the Bush presidential campaign in 2000. CEO Ken Lay was a confidant of the president, offering advice on choices for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and extolling deregulation of electricity prices in the depths of the California energy crisis.   The result of the meetings was an energy blueprint produced by Cheney tilted heavily to more drilling, exploration and coal mining, and dismissing energy conservation.   The repeated Enron meetings lend more substance to claims that the White House is on autopilot when it comes to energy: oil and gas interests come first, and there's no need to study any other options. Cheney's clumsy delays in acknowledging Enron's access is a reminder of the White House's tunnel vision on the topic.   But the meetings dredge up another embarrassing matter: Did Enron hint at its collapsing finances that ended in bankruptcy last month?   Cheney claims Enron's money troubles never came up. But given the company's insider status, it's worth pursuing further. Did the White House have advance word of the company's deepening problems that made it the largest bankruptcy in history? Thousands of angry stockholders and employees may want to know more about Enron's -- and Cheney's -- conduct.     Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.      California Mysteries of the Energy Plan  01/10/2002 Los Angeles Times Home Edition B-14 Copyright 2002 / The Times Mirror Company  For months, the White House has refused to hand over any information about the closed-door meetings of Vice President Dick Cheney's energy task force--a group that was heavy on energy executives, including Enron Corp. Chief Executive Kenneth L. Lay. Both Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) and the congressional General Accounting Office have insisted that the workings of the task force be disclosed. The White House has steadfastly maintained it is not obligated to do so. But considering the impact of the energy recommendations issued in May, from drilling for oil in Arctic wilderness to weakening the Clean Air Act, Americans should be privy to the making of these decisions. The collapse of Enron Corp., which has led to a federal criminal investigation, just bolsters the argument.   The links between administration officials and Enron, starting with President Bush's own ties to the now-disgraced Lay, are going to get deserved scrutiny from several congressional committees. Democrats are gleeful at having such a fat target in a congressional election year. Yet the White House continues releasing too little, too late.  In a Jan. 3 letter to Waxman, White House counsel David S. Addington states that Cheney or members of his energy task force met six times with Enron executives. Once Cheney met with Lay. All of the meetings may have been perfectly innocent. But the adamant refusal of the White House to explain what took place not only creates the appearance of impropriety but also illuminates a dangerous penchant for secrecy. Whether it's keeping Congress out of the loop or preventing historians from examining past presidential papers, this is too often the administration mind-set.   Some of Waxman's requests may be picayune. He is asking, for example, about any communication that may have taken place between Cheney and Lay at a panel discussion on energy matters held at an American Enterprise Institute forum in Colorado in June. But the bulk of Waxman's questions are not unreasonable. Given the enormity of the Enron collapse and the company's seeming role in determining U.S. energy policy, it seems fair to ask for details about the meetings, any requests for changes in federal policies by Enron executives, copies of documents presented and the names of those attending.   The vice president's office obviously doesn't see it that way. White House counsel Addington ends his paltry letter to Waxman by saying, \"It is our hope that submission of [this] information will help you avoid the waste of time and taxpayer funds on unnecessary inquiries.\" This is maximum spin.   Both Congress and the public deserve a full accounting of the administration's dealings with Enron. The fastest way to avoid wasting time and taxpayer money is for the White House to come clean.     Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.      UK: Wall St seen inching up, Enron dives in Europe.  01/10/2002 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2002.  LONDON, Jan 10 (Reuters) - U.S. shares were expected to creep higher on Thursday as investors held to the sidelines awaiting a flood of corporate earnings next week for guidance, and failed energy giant Enron Corp slid in Europe. March futures contracts pointed to a slightly firmer start on Wall Street with the Dow Jones blue-chip index up 15 points at 10,091 and the tech-laden Nasdaq rose 6.5 points to 1,662.   Dealers at electronic brokerage Instinet said shares in Enron fell 17 percent to 65 cents in light volume from a 79 cents close after the U.S. Justice Department opened a criminal investigation of Enron, amid controversy over its collapse.  On Wednesday officials declined to say exactly when the criminal probe began. But they said it was centered in the department's criminal division and that a task force was being set up to handle the case.   Robert Bennett, attorney for Enron, said, \"When this investigation is finished, a lot of the things that people are reading and hearing will be proven to be not true.\"   Dealers said there was very little volume in the market and they expected a wash-out day with little corporate news or economic data to determine the health of corporate America.   \"The U.S. indices tried to test their upper resistance levels and failed miserably on Wednesday. The Dow came nowhere near 10,300 and the Nasdaq almost but not quite made 2,100,\" said Tom Hougaard at Financial Spreads.   \"The punishment for this failure was severe and we closed below the lows of the days before. Technically this was a failure and should take prices even lower,\" he added.   Elsewhere, traders in London said there were modest rises in General Electric Company , up 10 cents at $38.65, Cisco rose 15 cents and Sun Microsystems was also marginally higher.   Dealers said they expected shares in JNI Corp to remain under pressure after the provider of enterprise storage connectivity products said on Wednesday it would report a wider-than-expected fourth quarter loss.    Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.     Enron Sees Court OK For Asset Sale Despite Objections By Kathy Chu  01/10/2002 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES    NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Beleaguered Enron Corp. (ENE) doesn't expect a flurry of creditor objections to significantly hurt its chances of getting court approval to sell its core energy-trading operations.  Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez, of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, is scheduled to hear Enron's motion to shed part of its crown jewels Friday. The hearing follows a competitive auction of the energy business planned for Thursday.   \"We expect the hearing to go forward,\" said Brian Rosen, of Weil, Gotshal & Manges law firm, which represents the bankrupt company.   Once the company and its official creditors committee have agreed upon a suitor for the struggling business and submits the offer to the court, approval should follow shortly thereafter, according to Rosen.   The sale is seen as an important step in reviving Enron's energy-trading operations, which generated about 90% of the company's $101 billion in revenue last year. Enron hopes that a creditworthy partner will take a 51% stake in the business, to be renamed New Energy Trading Co., while Enron maintains a 49% stake.   The idea: to bring business back to what was once the nation's dominant natural gas and electricity trader.   For their part, many of the creditors that filed objections - because of concern over which assets will be affected and what will be done with the proceeds of any sale - said it's likely they'll be able to resolve their differences with Enron ahead of or during Friday's court hearing.   \"I think that most of the concerns will be answered quickly,\" said Aaron Cahn, of Carter Ledyard & Milburn law firm, which represents a consortium of oil creditors that had requested clarification of which assets will be sold, among other requests.   Enron has said that it expects multiple bids for the energy-trading unit's hardware and software - including its valuable online trading platform - but not for the unit's trading book, the value of which the company estimates at $5 billion to $7 billion.   This alleviates the concerns of some creditors who were uncertain about whether the sale would affect their trading contracts with Enron.   Also, since proceeds from the sale are likely to come in as \"future revenue stream,\" according to Weil, Gotshal's Rosen, there may not be any immediate cash to put into escrow, as Enron creditors, including Wiser Oil Co., have requested.   If an all-cash order is received and approved by the company and its creditors' committee, then Enron will look to the court to decide how the proceeds will be handled, said Rosen.   Whatever happens, Enron and its advisors feel the energy-business sale needs to take place as soon as possible.   Delayed approval of the transaction could jeopardize the value of the energy-trading operations' assets, Enron has said. Also, while most of Enron North America's traders are still with the company, there's no guarantee that they'll stay indefinitely.   If the company and its creditors committee can agree upon a suitor at Thursday's auction, then information about the bid will be forwarded to interested parties - including objecting creditors - for review before the Friday hearing.   More than a dozen companies have expressed concern about the proposed sale, including Royal Bank of Scotland, General Electric Co.'s (GE) General Electric Corp., Eco-Tankship Inc. and El Paso Corp.'s (EP) El Paso Merchant Energy LP.   \"Many of the objections should disappear when people have more information,\" said James Beldner, an attorney for Enron retiree Michael Moran, an individual who sits on the committee and represents deferred compensation-plan holders.   -Kathy Chu; Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5392; kathy.chu@dowjones.com    (Carol S. Remond contributed to this story)      Enron May Reject Contracts, Leases With 10 Days Notice  01/10/2002 Dow Jones News Service (Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  (This story was originally published late Wednesday.)    NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- A federal bankruptcy judge is allowing Enron Corp. (ENE) to reject commercial property leases and contracts with creditors - as long as the bankrupt company gives these parties 10 business days notice.  The order, issued late Wednesday by Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, came after Enron modified its original motion to give creditors more time to object before the contract is deemed terminated.   Enron must also attempt to notify the attorneys for those parties involved, according to the judge's order.   If creditors oppose Enron's attempt to end an agreement, they can seek a court hearing.   -Kathy Chu, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5392;   e-mail: kathy.chu@dowjones.com    Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

This summer, my husband, Kim Erb, and I hosted a 4-year old girl named Alina from an orphanage in Taraz.  She came to us as part of Kidsave International's summer miracle program.  She returned with her group back to the orphanage at the end of August.  We miss her terribly.    We have been working anxiously to complete our dossier and our INS approvals to be able to bring Alina back to our family permanently.  Obviously world events have us very anxious about the adoption.  We are just as resolved to bring Alina home and I'd leave tomorrow if I had all the approvals.  My hope was lifted by hearing that you were able to travel home to Kazakstan last week.  We are working with an adoption agency called Across the World Adoptions.  Their Kazakstan agents are Sergei Pikalov and Larisa Reznikova.   Alina's orphanage in Taraz is called Ulan & this was the first time they ever participated in a summer program to send kids to the US.  There isn't any way for me to call or mail Alina now that she is back in the orphanage.  I am so fortunate that I am able to correspond via email with Sergei's wife (Larissa -- different Larissa) who was here this summer as a host with the kids.  Larissa and Sergei live in Almaty.  Larissa is a medical student.  She is rapidly improving her English through her visit and our continued correspondence.  Yesterday I was so touched that Larissa sent me a photograph of Alina.  Sergei was in Taraz last week and saw dear Alina & she is well.  Sorry for the long-winded background.  I hope you won't mind corresponding with me and offering me some travel advice.

How Enron Blew It  Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: money, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the most important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is bearish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?  by Mimi Swartz </mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.php>  THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like the international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil companies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with modernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, brown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. They are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual uniform of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Republic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the building intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of elevators, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets people entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E tipped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axis; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffeinated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratulating Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between elevator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: \"From the World's Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!\"  For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself from a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 percent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 billion to $100 billion. \"The very mention of the company in energy circles throughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,\" notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides market intelligence to the energy business.  This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determined to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant by then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a company that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, Enron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorporation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If you were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first crack. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. The company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech world, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succeeded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, \"was a great marriage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking mentality of the financial markets.\"  The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the end of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the American economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but the best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those who could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a company couldn't possibly go wrong.  Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of $80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's energy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant project in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who once touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the change in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncertain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture that the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.  ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD \"a totally different way of thinking about business-we got it.\" At Enron, in fact, you either \"got it\" or you were gone-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that the color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahogany floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a black vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white marble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skilling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after just six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (General Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in America (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unchained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, \"someone could actually get killed.\" Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Christmas morning. \"I had no idea what I'd let go of,\" Skilling says of all the personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron.   From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands of working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorced, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwasher. He almost missed his brother's wedding. \"Learning a foreign language-I never learned a foreign language!\" he exclaims. He never once took his youngest son to school. \"I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifteen-minute scheduling.\" Travel: \"You can't go to Africa for a week and get anything out of it!\" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. \"I'm not sure that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job,\" he says, finally. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains its pragmatic edge. \"It would have been easy to stay,\" he says. \"But that would not have been good for me.\"   He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, handsome in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assiduously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at reporters who have labeled his resignation \"bizarre\" and associates who are bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the limits of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put upon. \"I'm surprised,\" he says, \"that people have so much trouble understanding this.\"  PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early nineties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfolding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine to five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the pristine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lurked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in those days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with that scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with such humiliation?  But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighties when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural gas turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies frequently enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a volatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by federal deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanly gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG was then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transco chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doctoral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the Vietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwardly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, HNG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the state of Texas.  HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover attempts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies in the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled \"the purchase\" was being called \"the merger\" back in Houston, and before long, following some particularly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gravity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was running a new company called Enron. \"Over time it became clear that Lay had a better vision of the future,\" says one person associated with Enron at that time. \"He never fought change. He embraced change.\"  Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got started.   LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling had spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he had been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, Illinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) \"I liked being successful when I was working, and I was smart,\" he told BusinessWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than what he would come to call \"intellectual capital.\" He loved being smart, and he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Methodist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and took on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of his class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.   It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worrying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he alone saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world where credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and the price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an investment bank would.  Skilling worked up some numbers and found them \"absolutely compelling.\" Then the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron executives. He had a one-page presentation. \"Almost to a person,\" Skilling says, \"they thought it was stupid.\" Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dejected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and then said, \"Let's go.\"  The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of dozens of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of those divides that seem to define his life: \"I believed this whole world would be different, a huge breakthrough\" is the way Skilling puts it today, and even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, \"We were in.\" And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enron as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just for him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit. After that, says Skilling, \"we never looked back.\"  Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it had a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that would make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to dominate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the best access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could better predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to make trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the price of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but with startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could have ever imagined.  THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had made: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading business. The idea was to build a \"knowledge-based business,\" which demanded a skill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Most were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most of them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed bolder people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. \"Enron was going to create a niche for itself or die,\" one former executive explains. \"The people who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had narrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market.\"  Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the smartest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And because his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the biggest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First Boston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be \"aggressive.\" You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you were thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization.   You could see what he was looking for on \"Super Saturdays\" at the Houston headquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in between-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving ability, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called \"a sense of urgency.\" People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were the types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Maybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lofts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flung suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)  For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-and-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for structuring energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the globe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A company concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning the house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enron never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they could use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were overweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Program. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until ten at night. \"They were so cutting edge,\" rhapsodizes someone involved with the company health care program at the time. \"They really thought about the psychology and what it took to keep these people going.\"  Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that those titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries and decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonuses-with no cap. \"If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could make a lot of money,\" says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years until resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband division. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs joined him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or off-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a spectacular Mexican villa. \"Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'd say,\" one loyalist says.   And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas merchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the buzzword was \"aggressive,\" that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay believed the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business. Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better service at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they began barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power company presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly service areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who were somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying efforts).  But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay made him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations largest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The division had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $2 billion to $7 billion. \"Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track,\" the New York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skilling had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to transforming another.  \"FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,\" sang the New York Times in 1999. \"In the staid world of regulated utilities and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis,\" crowed Fortune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetable, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to discover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, steel, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedge against the usual winter downturn?  But most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech communications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline became another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades online in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bid price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enron, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empty lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from trading the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for what the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. \"Its strategy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commodities can help it do well even in an uncertain market,\" BusinessWeek insisted.  There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: the company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of customer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle customers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had to come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business clients as customers and began calling them \"counterparties.\"  Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were maximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk venture quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oil-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to underwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its markets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happened at all.   While many businesses used what was known in the industry as \"mark-to-market accounting,\" for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The company priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't get deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like annuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. However many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there might be something fishy about what they called \"subjective accounting,\" investors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the market fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a project that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't going to be high enough. \"Enron is known for leaving people at the altar,\" says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the company could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a contribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's competing literacy charity: \"Even the person who was supposed to give money away for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron,\" he says.  As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the Enron family put it, \"It became a company full of mercenaries.\" The change started at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like the commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported overhearing orders like \"I need a smart person-go buy me one\" or \"Buy me an intelligent slave, quick.\" Enron had never been the kind of place where people sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-parody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was too disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.  And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by Skilling in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking system in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and those with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname quickly became \"rank and yank.\") It was a point of pride that Skilling's division replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling associate put it, \"Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery store.\" Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enron's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' attitude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading culture, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enron higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World, he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially more lucrative project was pending elsewhere.  Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: \"They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost sight of the future,\" says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close deals within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-ups who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so often as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase \"No old tapes\" became an Enron clich?. \"People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight,\" says one former Enron executive.  In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restrictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company. E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, one for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, but they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture this way: \"They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while you bleed to death.\"  BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy company into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: Just as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of its remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dealt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who dealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enron's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building projects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enormous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. \"It wasn't the time for long-term approaches,\" an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood. \"It was the technology era.\"  To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebecca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many years the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her nickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had the requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of Enron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed $20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent of Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-one Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including two appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corporate America.  But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, India, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron way: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 percent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three changes in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and other Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals, and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.  Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisions were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firing lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relentless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keeping a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly difficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company as smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disaster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mark her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water utility that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water privatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greatest water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like another sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million.   But Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not like gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, and confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much diminished, was folded into Enron. \"I think it's best for Rebecca to start afresh,\" Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal. Or as one critic put it, \"They were more interested in destroying the old culture than running a business.\"   As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay announced the inevitable: \"The best time for the succession to occur is when the company is doing well,\" he told the press. \"Enron is doing extremely well now.\" In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.  ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debacle. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying the company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (Lay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to George W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying food or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in California, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had tried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy deregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its weaknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in January.  Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of constant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situation was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim that the state had never built enough power plants to service its population and never properly managed those it had. \"For three months Gray Davis did a very good job of blaming us,\" says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corporate communications. \"We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the White House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his biggest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take care of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis.\" (California utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's all too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a joke comparing California with the Titanic. (\"At least the Titanic went down with its lights on.\")  But the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billion in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too did the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first time in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to market. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds, Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.  Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, the stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. During the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who challenged Enron's financial reporting an \"asshole.\" When the company reported hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profits had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old assets. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling promised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. \"There wasn't any positive news,\" Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says now. \"Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade.\"  The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had asked in March whether Enron was overpriced. (\"Start with a pretty straightforward question: How exactly does Enron make its money?\") The routine cashing in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portrayed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken Lay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Journal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife within the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possible failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in the stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutionally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. \"When Wall Street is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,\" says Carol Coale. \"When a company falls out of favor, all these issues carry more weight.\"  This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started experiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their secretaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of their ways. \"It just created an attitude,\" one executive still at Enron says. \"If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? There was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'\"   Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardship duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. \"But,\" as one Houston oilman explains, \"if you have to negotiate a hardship duty with someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporation that's better suited for good times than bad.\"  As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the stock price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employees killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for him, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but \"innovate much closer to our core.\" As for the culture: \"Things like the Performance Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to categorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a morale problem.\"  That Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure with Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always believed in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them when the company was in trouble, it was different. \"Even Jeff's biggest detractors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door,\" one loyalist admits.  But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. \"Look,\" he says with finality, \"ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my interests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely.\"  Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling himself back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new technologies. \"The first wave never gets it right,\" he says. \"The stand-alone dot-coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a second wave that will change the world.\" Houston, he promises, will become the world's center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In fact, he is already shopping for office space.  \"This is the second wave, and Enron's got it,\" he says, almost breathless. \"There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that get it.\"",

Regulators Raise Power Rates \"           ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------    State backs rate hike: But increase still may not resolve crisis  By Carrie Peyton and Dale Kasler  Bee Staff Writers  (Published March 28, 2001)   SAN FRANCISCO - Brushing aside the shouts and hisses of outraged protesters,   state regulators approved a $4.8 billion-a-year utility rate hike Tuesday but   couldn't guarantee that the increases will remedy California's electricity   crisis.   With activists chanting \"rate hikes no way\" and utility executives branding   the decision as inadequate, the Public Utilities Commission voted 5-0 to   raise rates about 30 percent for customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co.   and Southern California Edison. The rate hike took effect immediately but   probably won't show up in customer bills until May.   But while PUC commissioners said they were taking a bold step, major holes   remain in the state's patchwork effort to save the two beleaguered utilities   and ensure reliable energy supplies during what promises to be a long, hot   summer:   The higher rates won't pay off billions in old utility debts, leaving PG&E   and Edison under the continued threat of a bankruptcy filing by power   generators, bondholders or other creditors.   The increases will likely curtail energy consumption, but it's unlikely the   cutbacks will be enough to stave off rolling blackouts this summer. The PUC   put off a crucial decision on how to allocate the rate hikes across customer   categories, and the final rate design could determine how much Californians   will conserve.   The vote may not achieve one of its key goals: reviving the wind farms,   cogenerators and other   alternative-energy producers that provide more than 20 percent of   California's electricity. Hundreds have shut down in recent weeks because of   nonpayment by PG&E and Edison, contributing to rolling blackouts March 19 and   20.   After months of prodding, the PUC approved what may well be the largest   utility rate increase in California's history, saying it had no choice if it   was to shore up utility finances and lessen the risk of blackouts. It raised   rates just under 30 percent in addition to making permanent a 9 percent   surcharge approved in January.   The increased revenue will go to pay for the state Department of Water   Resources' power purchases on the utilities' behalf, and to   alternative-energy producers that supply a major chunk of the utilities'   power.   The PUC's move could make utility bankruptcies more palatable to state   officials because it ensures payment for future power supplies. \"Now, if we   have a bankruptcy, a lot of bad things will probably happen, but there's less   risk to the general public of mass power disruptions,\" said state Sen. Debra   Bowen, D-Marina del Rey, chairwoman of the Senate Energy Committee.   PG&E, arguing that the PUC didn't go nearly far enough, said it will demand   the panel reconsider.   \"Today's  ( actions, while providing a welcome dose of realism in the energy   policy debate, unfortunately do not resolve any of the key issues facing   California's policymakers,\" PG&E President Gordon Smith said.   Smith said the decision could worsen California's energy problems by forcing   the utilities to pay the state Department of Water Resources, which is buying   power on the utilities' behalf, ahead of other creditors.   An Edison vice president, Bruce Foster, said the rate increase \"is a step in   the right direction\" but added, \"Only time will tell if it's enough.\" The   company announced it will start making interest payments on defaulted bond   and bank debts.   Edison and PG&E both criticized the commission for sharply lowering the PUC's   estimates of the utilities' debts.   PUC commissioners acknowledged they have more work to do to resolve   California's energy mess - and some hinted that additional rate hikes may be   in the offing.   \"Have we gotten the number right? I don't know,\" said Commissioner Henry   Duque. But PUC President Loretta Lynch said the $4.8 billion will be enough   to pay California's ongoing power bills.   Meanwhile, Gov. Gray Davis repeated his opposition to rate hikes.   \"We do not have all the appropriate financial numbers necessary to make a   decision,\" Davis said. \"Until we do, I cannot support any rate increase.  (   While I have opposed rate increases, if it becomes clear that a rate increase   is absolutely necessary for the good of the state, I will support one that is   fair and do my duty to convince Californians of its necessity.\"   Yet most observers believe the PUC acted with Davis' approval - three of its   members are Davis appointees - and last Friday his aides shared data with   business lobbyists indicating rates would rise substantially, said Jack   Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers & Technology Association.   Consumer advocates blasted rate increases as a surrender to the power   generators that control much of California's electricity.   Noting that the state's grid operator has accused the generators of   overcharging Californians by $6.2 billion, they urged the PUC to focus its   firepower on those \"robber barons on steroids,\" as Berkeley activist Barbara   George put it.   \"It's like dealing with the mob,\" said Doug Heller of the Foundation for   Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. \"Instead of breaking our fingers, they're going   to turn the lights out again.\"   Jamming the PUC's auditorium to near capacity, activists said the state   should seize the generators' power plants. They razzed the commissioners with   taunts of \"blood money!\" and \"it's a sham,\" prompting guards to escort some   protesters out.   PUC President Lynch partially agreed with the protesters, saying the   generators are \"the real culprits in our energy crisis.\" But she said the   commission had to approve rate hikes.   The PUC ordered the utilities to help state officials fight the power   generators to refund some of their profits. Lynch said the rate hikes would   be refunded to customers if generators are forced to surrender money.   The higher rates will generate $2.51 billion in additional yearly revenue for   Edison and $2.28 billion for PG&E, according to PUC estimates.   But with most of the money going to reimburse the state Department of Water   Resources for current and future power purchases, the PUC action doesn't   repay the billions the utilities owe to generators and other creditors.   \"You still have $14 billion, maybe more, of costs that haven't been paid for,   and that's still a problem,\" said Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading   Forum, an association of power generators. \"I don't believe creditors are   going to be infinitely patient.\"   The two utilities have defaulted on billions of debts and face a daily threat   of bankruptcy.   \"That's still an issue that ultimately has to be addressed,\" said Senior Vice   President John Stout of Reliant Energy Inc., a generator that's owed $370   million.   Davis is negotiating to buy the transmission grid from Edison, PG&E and San   Diego Gas & Electric Co. as a means of paying off the utilities' existing   debts. But Bowen, the Energy Committee chair, said she doubts the deal will   go through.   Beyond complaining the PUC didn't solve the existing-debt issue, the   utilities were dismayed by a change in PUC accounting that sharply lowers   estimates of their debts and could have major impacts on how much control   regulators keep over their operations for months to come. Even though rates   keep going up, a state ordered rate freeze remains technically in effect, and   that freeze gives regulators ammunition to argue that utilities can't pass   all their costs on to customers.   PG&E's Smith called it the \"most egregious\" commission action. Edison called   it \"illegal.\"   The board voted to raise rates 3 cents a kilowatt-hour - and make permanent a   1-cent increase approved in January. Documents from Lynch's office said rates   would rise on average 29 percent, but Lynch later described it as 26 percent.   The PUC put off a decision on how the higher rates will affect each customer   category, other than to say it's leaning toward a system that will charge   more for electricity consumed above a certain threshold. The PUC estimated   that 45 percent of residential ratepayers - those who use less than that   threshold - will see no rise at all. Lynch proposed some businesses would see   rate hikes of as much as 87 percent.   \"How much conservation will this get us? It will depend very much on how it's   designed,\" said Severin Borenstein of the University of California Energy   Institute.   The rate hikes won't affect customers of municipal utilities such as   Sacramento Municipal Utility District. SMUD is planning a 16 percent rate   hike.   The PUC vote may do little to help the hundreds of alternative-energy   producers known as \"qualifying facilities,\" many of which have shut down for   nonpayment.   The PUC on Tuesday ordered PG&E and Edison to start paying these producers in   April, but some of the producers say the PUC's new pricing mechanism doesn't   get them back on their feet financially. Many, following the lead of one   Imperial Valley producer, may choose to sever their contracts with the two   utilities and sell their power elsewhere, even out of state.   \"This is not a solution,\" cogenerators' lawyer Jerry Bloom said of the PUC   vote. \"It will drive additional (plants) off the system.\"   California can ill afford to lose suppliers. On Tuesday, the Independent   System Operator, which runs the power grid, declared a Stage 2 alert, meaning   reserve supplies had dipped to less than 5 percent of demand.   And many experts believe California won't be able to avoid blackouts this   summer. The severe drought hitting the Pacific Northwest will deprive   California of a critical source of hydroelectricity.   Utility stocks, which shot up Monday in anticipation of the PUC's vote,   retreated slightly on Tuesday. PG&E Corp. shares dropped 44 cents to $13.20;   Edison International fell 39 cents to $14.16.

Then skyrocketing   natural gas bills socked the Sacramento industrial laundry service. Now a   third financial blow looms - higher electricity bills.   \"It's become a real nightmare. It's pretty scary. You have to find money to   pay these bills,\" said Sylvia Compton, co-owner of the longtime family-owned   south Sacramento business.   It could be worse for Compton, whose business is served by the Sacramento   Municipal Utility District. It will be for customers of Pacific Gas and   Electric Co., who face rate hikes averaging 30 percent in addition to a 9   percent rate increase already approved.   The California Public Utilities Commission gave PG&E and Southern California   Edison permission to raise electric rates by $4.8 billion a year. How the   burden will fall on various customer groups hasn't been decided.   Although SMUD customers aren't affected by the PUC's decision to sharply   raise rates, they aren't likely to be immune. SMUD, also facing skyrocketing   energy costs, is considering rate increases ranging from 13 percent to 25   percent.   For Dust-Tex and scores of other California companies, any rate hike would be   another unwelcome increase in the cost of doing business. It will hit at a   time the U.S. economy is slowing and employer costs such as health benefits   are soaring.   For consumers, it will mean a double blow, higher electricity bills at home   and higher prices for goods and services.   Raley's, the West Sacramento-based supermarket chain, for example, uses huge   amounts of electricity not only for lights and refrigeration at its stores,   but also to cool food at its distribution centers. Given the thin profit   margins of the grocery business, it has little choice but to raise prices.   \"We are doing all we can at Raley's to conserve energy. But as rates go up we   will have to pass those increases on to our customers in the cost of goods,\"   said Michael Teel, Raley's president and chief executive officer.   The higher electric bills approved by the PUC - aimed at keeping the state's   two biggest utilities from bankruptcy - mean California businesses and   consumers will have almost $5 billion less to spend each year on other   things.   While that amount represents a huge bite out of consumer spending, by itself,   it won't necessarily lead to a recession, said Brad Williams, senior   economist at the state Legislative Analyst's Office.   \"What we're really talking about is less economic growth,\" Williams said.   \"Some households will feel this, and it will pinch their budgets and affect   how much income they have for purchasing goods and services.\"   The state estimates that spending on electricity last year averaged between 2   and 3 percent of both business production costs and household budgets.   Some business owners and economists welcomed the boost in electricity rates,   saying in the long run, they will spur energy conservation efforts, boost   power generating capacity and prevent rolling blackouts and their devastating   effect on business productivity.   \"It's much worse for us if we have these damn blackouts. We have 100   employees, and if there's a blackout they're all sitting around twiddling   their thumbs and I've still got to pay them,\" said Norm Rogers, president of   Z-World Inc. in Davis, which designs and builds miniature special-purpose   computers.   Many economists and business experts believe rolling blackouts, not higher   electricity rates, are the biggest threat to the economy.   \"It's better to have higher rates and secure power than lower rates and   blackouts,\" said Stephen Levy, senior economist at the Center for Continuing   Study of the California Economy. The state can work through the higher power   costs - just as it did when gasoline and diesel prices soared last year, Levy   said.   In reaction to the higher power rates, a small number of businesses may leave   California, expand out of state, or fail, though most will be able to weather   the short run, said Robert Smiley, dean of the Graduate School of Management   at the University of California, Davis.   Most firms will give the state just six to 18 months to solve the energy   crisis before \"they'll start looking elsewhere,\" Smiley said.   David Molinaro, owner of Yolo Ice and Creamery Inc., a Woodland-based ice   cream, dairy and ice distributor, can't pick up and leave. He absorbed higher   diesel fuel costs for his 11 delivery trucks for six months before levying a   surcharge in January. There's just no way his company can eat the higher   electricity costs, he said.   \"It's frustrating. People are thinking you are getting rich by raising   prices,\" Molinaro said.   Other businesses may have little choice but to swallow the higher utility   costs.   \"We compete with global suppliers for almost every product. It's virtually   impossible for us to pass these costs on,\" said Jeff Boese of the California   League of Food Processors. \"If we don't get a handle on energy costs very   quickly I would suspect a significant number of food processors to leave the   state.\"   In past months, the rocketing energy costs have forced companies to take   dramatic steps to shave expenses.   Dust-Tex, for example, has scrapped pay raises, raised prices 10 percent, cut   hours for some workers, put a freeze on hiring and changed auto insurance   coverage for its truck fleet. At the same time, it invested $60,000 for a new   energy-efficient dryer.   California Family Health & Fitness, which has eight health clubs in the   capital region, has tabled plans for two additional gyms until it gets a   better handle on future energy costs, according to co-owner Larry Gury. But   Gury and his partner are looking at spending $150,000 to $200,000 at each of   four gyms to install solar panels for heating the pools and running the   lights.   Some impacts might not be seen for some time. In the health care industry,   for example, the energy crisis has only added to existing financial   pressures, said Larry Levitt, vice president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family   Foundation.   Pressed by higher bills, some employers may opt to trim or eliminate health   benefits for workers, Levitt said.

A rate increase approved by the state Public Utilities Commission on Tuesday   does not affect households that use less than 130 percent of a baseline   amount of power.   Forty-five percent of households already stay within that limit, according to   PUC President Loretta Lynch. The proportion is slightly less in Pacific Gas   and Electric's territory - 42 percent, utility spokeswoman Jann Tabor said.   The baseline amount differs from region to region and from season to season.   The Sacramento Municipal Utility District is not affected by the PUC-approved   increase but is planning to raise rates this spring, as well. It, too,   proposes to protect the thriftiest customers by raising the price only of   kilowatt-hours used over baseline. District rate administrator Alan Wilcox   said roughly half of SMUD households consume only baseline amounts of power.   Everyone else has the opportunity to dodge rate increases by scaling back   their electricity use.   How difficult might that be? If you're accustomed to using a central air   conditioner all summer and unwilling to turn up the thermostat, it could be   difficult, by Wilcox's reckoning.   \"If you're running an air-conditioning load in the Valley, you could probably   expect to get into that second tier (above baseline) a little bit,\" he said.   \"There are a lot of people who do not use their air conditioning a lot or   have swamp coolers or just go without.\"   In SMUD territory, the baseline is 700 kilowatt-hours per month in summer,   and 620 kwh in winter for most customers. (Households that do not use gas and   are powered entirely by electricity get a higher baseline allowance.)   Wilcox said the baseline is based upon average consumption - at least, it was   the average when the baseline was set in the early 1990s. Consumption has   crept up a bit since, to 752 kwh a month last year.   Under SMUD's rate-increase proposal, the summertime rate would remain at   8.058 cents per kilowatt-hour for the first 700 kwh. The price would rise by   10 cents a kilowatt-hour for the next 300 kwh used, up to 1,000 kwh.   Big energy consumers would pay more than 16 cents for each kwh used over   1,000 kwh.   Bottom line: The biggest users pay the most.   Details of the rate increase approved by the PUC - which will affect PG&E   customers, as well as those served by Southern California Edison and San   Diego Gas & Electric - have yet to be worked out, but the rates are expected   to be structured in a similar tiered fashion.   Currently, PG&E customers year-around pay 11.4 cents per kilowatt-hour up to   the baseline limit, and 13 cents for every kilowatt-hour over baseline. The   average baseline throughout the territory is between 300 and 400 kwh, Tabor   said; it varies from region to region to account for climate.   Tabor said the PG&E baseline amounts to between 50 percent and 60 percent of   the average electricity use per household in a given territory. That   proportion, she said, was taken from a \"Lifeline\" program in effect from 1976   to 1984 that was meant to provide a minimum necessary quantity of electricity   and gas at a lower cost.   Tabor said 31 percent of PG&E's 4,017,000 residential customers use only   baseline amounts of electricity.

Gray Davis said the increase is   premature.   The governor, appearing to soften his long-standing opposition, said he would   support a rate increase only if financial information shows that a rate   increase is \"necessary for the good of the state.\"   The Public Utilities Commission, controlled by Davis appointees, voted 5-0   for an immediate rate increase. A statement from Davis, who usually demands   that appointees reflect his policy, did not say whether he would ask the PUC   or the Legislature for a rollback if he concludes the increase is unneeded.                   Developments in California's power crisis   Congressman eyes nuclear vessels as source of power   Bush calls California energy crisis 'ominous'   Rate hike means new political heat for California governor   ?         \"He can ask,\" said Steve Maviglio, Davis' press secretary. \"That is one of   many options. But now we are waiting for the numbers to plug in the data and   see if a rate increase is necessary.\"   The PUC has not yet acted on the request of San Diego Gas and Electric for a   rate increase. SDG&E has a debt of $681 million but has been paying all of   its bills, unlike PG&E and Edison. Those companies say they have debt of $13   billion.   SDG&E is in a different situation because its rates were capped by   legislation in September that guarantees payment of its debt, allowing the   utility to borrow. The bills of SDG&E customers soared last summer when the   utility became the first to be deregulated.   \"Since the PUC has approved rate hikes for Edison and PG&E, we would hope   they give an expedited review to our request for an increase of 2.3 cents per   kilowatt hour,\" said Ed Van Herik, a SDG&E spokesman.   Consumer groups warned that out-of-state generators, who have been ordered by   FERC to make some rebates for overcharging, will make even more money under   the rate increase. Some are urging Davis to seize California power plants   owned by the generators.   \"These people are war criminals,\" said Mike Florio, an attorney for The   Utility Reform Network in San Francisco.   The PUC meeting, which occurred on a day when the state was hit by a Stage 2   alert because of reduced imports from the Northwest, was interrupted by   shouts from demonstrators who want a state-owned power system. They chanted,   \"Public power now, we won't pay\" and \"Rate hikes no way, make the energy   companies pay.\"   Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa   Monica, which is threatening to put a public power initiative on the ballot   next year, said some attorneys think the abrupt rate increase can be   challenged in court.   Assemblyman Rod Pacheco, R-Riverside, announced that he will introduce   legislation to repeal the rate increase. He said a decision should be made   not by appointees but by elected officials who are accountable to the public.   Democratic legislative leaders, who have large majorities in both houses,   said Monday that they have reluctantly concluded a rate increase is   necessary. Davis is scheduled to meet with Assembly Democrats this afternoon.   The rate increase approved for PG&E and Edison yesterday is 3 cents per   kilowatt hour. The PUC president, Loretta Lynch, said media reports of the   increase amounting to a 40 percent rise are inaccurate.   Lynch said the increase in the monthly bills of ratepayers would be about 26   percent if applied across the board. She bases her figure on the total bill   that includes electricity, transmission, distribution and other costs.   The media's characterization of the rate increase as 40 percent is based on   only the cost of electricity, not the total bill. The electricity costs   before the increase were 7.2 cents per kilowatt hour for Edison and 6.7 cents   for PG&E. SDG&E's rate is 6.5 cents.   Lynch proposed the rate increase after a report issued last week showed that   the state, which was forced to begin buying power for the utilities in   mid-January, will have to spend more than expected. A state plan to lower   costs through long-term contracts will fall short this summer.   The state has been spending about $1.5 billion a month to buy power. The PUC   also voted unanimously yesterday to give the state a share of the monthly   bill collected by utilities, which will be used to finance a bond of $10   billion or more to repay the state general fund for the power purchases.   The state was jolted last week by rolling blackouts that few expected before   summer, when heat drives up the demand for electricity. A number of small   generators that provide a quarter of the state's power are not operating   because they have not been paid by utilities.   The PUC voted yesterday to order Edison and PG&E to begin paying the small   generators under a new formula that links their payments to the price of   natural gas at the Oregon border, rather than at the Southern California   border with Arizona. Prices at the Arizona border have been 50 percent   higher.   David Fogarty of the Western States Petroleum Association, which represents   50 small generators, said many of the small plants in Southern California   will have to continue to buy their natural gas at the higher price on the   Arizona border.   \"Many of them will find it uneconomic to continue to operate,\" Fogarty   warned.   Edison has not paid the small generators in the federal \"qualifying   facilities\" program since November. PG&E has been paying them only about 15   percent.   The PUC did not order the utilities to pay off the $1.5 billion they owe to   the small generators. Jan Smutny-Jones of the Independent Energy Producers   said some of the small generators will not be able to buy gas until they can   pay their debts.   Many of the small generators produce power from \"renewable\" sources such as   solar, wind, geothermal and biomass. But most of the small generators use   natural gas turbines that also produce heat for commercial purposes.   Whether Lynch acted on her own when she proposed the increase or was prompted   by the Davis administration is a topic of speculation. Davis aides told   reporters during a background briefing yesterday that they did not learn of   Lynch's proposal until Sunday night.   They said the governor was briefed Monday morning and that he did not urge   his PUC appointees to delay the increase. An Edison official said the utility   received the proposal late Monday morning and had little time to prepare for   a hasty PUC hearing on the increase that afternoon.   The two commissioners appointed by former Gov. Pete Wilson, Richard Bilas and   Henry Duque, said they have been urging a rate increase. But both complained   of the short notice and the lack of time to study the complex proposals   approved yesterday.   Davis aides said they do not understand how Lynch arrived at an increase of 3   cents per kilowatt hour. The governor is waiting for estimates of state power   purchases this summer, available generation, the effect of conservation, the   potential for federally ordered refunds from generators, and other data   before he makes a rate decision.   The Davis appointees on the commission, Geoffrey Brown and Carl Wood, praised   Lynch for showing courageous leadership.   The increase approved yesterday, which utility spokesmen said was the largest   in their history, comes on top of a 9 percent residential increase for Edison   and PG&E imposed in January and a scheduled 10 percent increase next March,   when a \"rate reduction\" paid for by a $6 billion bond expires.   Lynch said the rate increase approved yesterday takes effect immediately but   will not show up on customer bills until May or later. The PUC is working on   a plan to design the increase to encourage conservation, giving the biggest   increases to those that use the most electricity.   About 45 percent of the utilities' residential customers will have no   increase because of legislation exempting households that use 130 percent or   less of the \"baseline,\" a minimum amount of electricity use that varies with   climate zones around the state.   -----------------------------------------------------------------      City leaders in East County schedule forum on energy woes           UNION-TRIBUNE   March 28, 2001   Members of the four East County city councils will hold a workshop tomorrow   to talk about ways to deal with the energy crisis.   The meeting is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. at the La Mesa Community Center,   4975 Memorial Drive, La Mesa.   Council members from La Mesa, Santee, El Cajon and Lemon Grove will discuss   energy-saving policies and ordinances they could enact.   Cities might look at having energy-efficient traffic lights installed or   requiring new houses to use alternative energy sources, said La Mesa Mayor   Art Madrid.   \"It's acknowledging that we have a problem and coming up with a solution,\"   Madrid said.   Kurt Kammerer of the San Diego Regional Energy Office is scheduled to give a   presentation to the group. Members of the audience will have an opportunity   to make comments.   ------------------------------------------------------------------      Developments in California's power crisis           ASSOCIATED PRESS   March 28, 2001   Here is a look at developments in California's electricity crisis:   WEDNESDAY:    ) The state remains free of power alerts in the early morning as power   reserves stay above 7 percent.    ) The Assembly resumes hearings on California's high natural gas prices.    ) The Assembly is expected to try again to pass a bill that would let the   state Public Utilities Commission order Southern California Edison Co. and   Pacific Gas & Electric Co. to pay alternative-energy plants.   TUESDAY:    ) The PUC votes unanimously to approve electricity rate hikes of up to 46   percent for customers of California's two largest utilities. The board votes   5-0 to increase rates immediately for PG&E and Edison despite yells from   protesters. The increases are the largest in California history.    ) Stock in both utilities suffer slight losses after expectations of the rate   hikes Monday caused shares in PG&E Corp. to surge 29 percent and Edison   International's stock to gain 30 percent. Edison International closed down 39   cents at $14.16 a share. PG&E Holding Corp., parent of Pacific Gas &   Electric, closed down 55 cents at $13.20.    ) In a Tuesday afternoon conference call, Southern California Edison says it   will begin paying interest to its bondholders after weeks of failure to pay.   Company authorities say they have not heard whether the news will boost their   credit rating and do not specify a dollar amount for monthly interest   payments.    ) The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which is not attached to the   state power grid and is not affected by deregulation, issues a statement   Tuesday assuring that customer rates \"will continue to remain stable.\"    ) Standard & Poors retains California's cautionary credit rating despite   state regulators' decision to raise electricity rates. The state has been on   a credit watch \"with negative implications\" since it began spending $45   million a day to buy electricity for customers of two nearly bankrupt   utilities. The crediw watch will remain in effect despite a rate increase   state regulators approved Tuesday.    ) President Bush says the electricity price caps sought by California's Gray   Davis and other Western governors would worsen the region's energy crisis   instead of helping cure it. In a speech to the Kalamazoo Chamber of Commerce,   Bush says price controls helped cause the gasoline crisis of the 1970s, and   he won't make the same mistake.    ) Joseph Fichera, the governor's chief negotiator on the purchase of   transmission lines, says he is exchanging drafts of proposed agreements with   Edison officials but won't say how soon a final agreement may be reached. He   says negotiations are continuing with PG&E and San Diego Gas & Electric.    ) State agencies announce a March 29 workshop in Ontario for developers who   hope to build peaking power plants in time for this summer. The event is   similar to one held two weeks ago in Sacramento. Peaking plants are used for   short periods when power supplies run low.    ) California's Independent System Operator declares a Stage 2 alert when   electricity reserves were approaching only 5 percent of available power. ISO   spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle says the alert was triggered when 1,000   megawatts was unexpectedly lost from the Pacific Northwest. WHAT'S NEXT:    ) The Davis administration continues negotiations with Edison, PG&E and San   Diego Gas & Electric Co. over state acquisition of their transmission lines.  THE PROBLEM:   High demand, high wholesale energy costs, transmission glitches and a tight   supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest and   maintenance at aging California power plants are all factors in California's   electricity crisis.   Edison and PG&E say they've lost nearly $14 billion since June to high   wholesale prices that the state's electricity deregulation law bars them from   passing onto ratepayers, and are close to bankruptcy.   Electricity and natural gas suppliers, scared off by the two companies' poor   credit ratings, are refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to   start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and   business customers.   ------------------------------------------------------------------      Congressman eyes nuclear vessels as source of power         By Toby Eckert   COPLEY NEWS SERVICE   March 28, 2001   WASHINGTON -- As California braces for more blackouts this summer, a key   House Republican has floated a plan that includes mobilizing a federal   disaster agency, waiving some environmental regulations and exploring whether   nuclear reactors aboard Navy ships could be connected to the power grid.   Several Democrats immediately attacked the plan for not including electricity   price controls sought by Gov. Gray Davis and other California officials. They   also charged that it would undermine clean air laws.   The 17-point plan was drafted by Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, chairman of the   House Commerce Committee's energy and air quality subcommittee. Copies were   obtained by Copley News Service.   Samantha Jordan, a spokeswoman for Barton, confirmed that he had circulated   some proposals for responding to the Western power crisis among subcommittee   members late last week. Some of the ideas were deleted before the list was   forwarded to the White House, Jordan added, but she would not say which ones.   Barton has presided over several hearings on the power crunch and has said   that he is \"more than prepared\" to draft legislation to help California. A   White House task force, headed by Vice President Dick Cheney, is also   developing a national energy policy.   President Bush has repeatedly stated his opposition to caps on wholesale   power prices. He has called for a concerted effort to increase energy   production.   The list of ideas Barton sent to subcommittee members was aimed at boosting   power generation and transmission in the West, increasing conservation and   preparing for blackouts.   Some of the production and transmission measures called for quickly expanding   a crucial power conduit in the Central Valley known as Path 15, using federal   funds for all or part of the project; allowing small power generators to sell   electricity to buyers other than the state's cash-strapped utilities; and   establishing standards for allowing businesses with on-site electricity   generation to send surplus supplies to the power grid.   Other steps, sure to be unpopular with environmentalists, could be taken if a   state declares an \"electricity emergency.\" In addition to the idea of   harnessing the energy from nuclear-powered Navy ships and submarines, they   include temporarily waiving nitrogen oxide emission limits at power plants,   allowing the construction of generating plants on federal and Indian lands,   restarting mothballed nuclear reactors and delaying for a year a plan to   divert water in California's Trinity River from power generation to   environmental restoration.   On the conservation side, Barton proposed allowing states to lengthen   daylight savings time and requiring federal facilities to reduce energy use   by 10 percent.   Finally, the Federal Emergency Management Agency would be directed to open an   office in California, conduct an educational campaign to prepare the public   for blackouts and have a plan ready to provide assistance during power   outages.   Barton has been skeptical of the idea of having the federal government limit   the cost of wholesale power in the West and did not include that among his   proposals. Instead, he said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should   investigate whether wholesale prices are \"unjust and unreasonable\" -- a   finding FERC already has made once.   That drew the criticism of four California Democrats -- Reps. Henry Waxman of   Los Angeles, Anna Eshoo of Atherton, Jane Harman of Torrance and Lois Capps   of Santa Barbara -- who sit on the House Commerce Committee. They sent a   letter to Barton on Friday spelling out their objections.   \"He's left off the 10-ton gorilla solution, which is directing the FERC to   .?.?. impose a reasonable cap on the price of wholesale electricity,\" Harman   said.   The Democrats also said that Barton's proposals would \"undermine the Clean   Air Act\" and that there is \"widespread agreement among those directly   involved in California's electricity system that clean air rules are not   responsible for electricity shortages.\"   -----------------------------------------------------------------      Bush calls California energy crisis 'ominous'           But he foresees no quick relief, opposes controls  By George E. Condon Jr.   COPLEY NEWS SERVICE   March 28, 2001   KALAMAZOO, Mich. -- President Bush yesterday made his most extensive remarks   yet on the energy crisis in California, calling the situation \"ominous\" and   proclaiming that \"the time to act is now.\"   Despite that pledge, though, he held out little hope of any speedy relief for   the hard-hit state. He also restated his opposition to energy price controls.   The president, who has previously addressed the energy crunch only in answers   to reporters' questions, used a \"state of the economy\" speech to a business   group at Western Michigan University to elaborate on his still-evolving   energy policy.   He broke no new ground in his remarks, but seemed to be reacting to West   Coast criticism that the federal government should be more aggressive in   finding a solution to the rolling blackouts plaguing the nation's most   populous state.   \"The energy problem wasn't created overnight and we won't solve the problem   overnight,\" he said. \"But we will at least start down the right road so that   the shortages we face today will not recur year after year.\"   He said a task force headed by Vice President Dick Cheney will come up with a   long-term strategy, but he ruled out any move by his administration that   would remedy the crisis quickly.   \"We'll not solve the energy problem by running the energy market from out of   Washington, D.C.,\" he said. \"We will solve the energy problem by freeing the   creativity of the American people to find new sources of energy and to   develop the new technologies that use energy better, more efficiently and   more cleanly.\"   He singled out for criticism any call that Washington cap energy prices.   \"This administration does not, and will not, support energy price controls,\"   he said to applause from the business-oriented audience. \"Price controls do   not increase supply, and they do not encourage conservation. Price controls   contributed to the gas lines of the 1970s. And the United States will not   repeat the mistake again.\"   He portrayed the energy crisis as a clear threat to his hopes of revitalizing   the national economy.   And he signaled that he understands Californians are facing hardships.   \"The lights are dimming in California. Consumers and businesses in California   are paying sharply higher energy bills. And as we compare our future energy   needs to the currently projected domestic energy supply, we see an ominous   growing gap,\" he said.   He said the blame for the problem belongs to previous decision-makers.   \"Our people are paying a high price for years of neglect. And the time to act   is now,\" he said.   Meanwhile, Bush said he would nominate utility regulators from Texas and   Pennsylvania to fill vacancies at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,   or FERC, the agency that has played a pivotal role in the California crisis.   However, Bush stopped short of replacing the chairman of the commission,   Curtis Hebert, who has drawn fire from Gov. Gray Davis and other California   officials for his outspoken faith in open power markets and staunch   opposition to federal controls on the soaring price of wholesale power sold   in the West.   There was widespread speculation that Hebert, a Republican, was on his way   out as chairman.   A White House spokeswoman would not say whether Bush has ruled out naming   another commissioner to the top job at a later date.   Bush nominated Patrick Henry Wood III and Nora Mead Brownell to round out the   five-member commission.   Wood is chairman of the Texas Public Utility Commission and was an adviser to   Bush on energy issues during the presidential transition. Many observers had   expected Bush to name him chairman of FERC.   Brownell is a member of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission.   Both nominees, who face Senate confirmation, were praised by power industry   officials and consumer groups. They have helped steer deregulation plans in   their states that are thought to be on sounder footing than California's   failed experiment.  ------------------------------------------------------------------      Rate hike means new political heat for California governor           By Alexa Haussler  ASSOCIATED PRESS   March 28, 2001   SACRAMENTO  ) Rolling blackouts and a record increase in electricity rates are   putting the political squeeze on Gov. Gray Davis just as he prepares for his   re-election campaign.   The Democratic governor took a hit Tuesday when the Public Utilities   Commission  ) three of its five members appointed by Davis  ) approved the very   rate hikes he has repeatedly said would not be needed.   The power crunch is just the weakness political foes are looking for; it   could leave everyone from business owners to consumers looking for someone to   blame at the polls next year.   \"He's the face of the problem right now and so he is going to be the target,\"   said Nancy Snow, a political scientist at the University of California, Los   Angeles.   Davis already has been criticized as having a leadership style that is a   \"little bit too much in the mushy, middle-of-the-road area,\" Snow said.   \"That's something that he is going to have to overcome in order to   politically survive this crisis.\"   California Republicans blame the first-term governor for four widespread   power outages this year that they call \"Gray-outs.\" His first major   challenger in 2002, GOP Secretary of State Bill Jones, is making energy a   campaign centerpiece.   A top state financial official and fellow Democrat, Controller Kathleen   Connell, says Davis' decision to buy power for Southern California Edison and   Pacific Gas and Electric is putting the state in financial danger.   And Democratic lawmakers are privately grumbling about Davis' handling of the   crisis as consumer groups threaten a revolt on the 2002 ballot. With up to 25   million Californians affected by the rate hikes, consumer activists hope to   attract millions of rebels to the polls.   The PUC voted unanimously to immediately raise rates up to 46 percent for   Edison and PG&E customers, saying that would reduce power use this summer and   help keep the cash-starved utilities in business.   The increases  ) which come on top of already-approved hikes of 9 to 15   percent and a 10 percent increase planned next year  ) are the biggest in   state history.   Davis issued a written statement Tuesday easing his ardent opposition to a   rate hike.   \"While I have opposed rate increases, if it becomes clear that a rate   increase is absolutely necessary for the good of the state, I will support   one that is fair and do my duty to convince Californians of its necessity,\"   Davis said.   Davis' aides are frantically trying to deflect criticism surrounding the   increase and assure voters the governor is working to build more power plants   and boost conservation to avert blackouts during the hot summer months.   Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor opposes a rate increase but   has no power to order the PUC to maintain current rates.   \"They are an independent body, they can do what they want,\" Maviglio said.   He insisted the governor wasn't informed of PUC Chairwoman Loretta Lynch's   plan to announce a rate increase Monday, declaring to reporters: \"It's not a   story  ) it's the truth.\"   Still, some Republicans and Democrats have said the governor has been   inconsistent about his pull with the commission.   He announced last week at a dinner with state labor leaders that he had   directed the PUC to order utilities to start paying overdue bills to   facilities that produce renewable energy.   In addition, Davis administration officials informed several key Assembly   members Friday that the state's power-buying for Edison and PG&E could cost   far more than the $10 billion lawmakers and Davis estimated when they   approved legislation authorizing the power purchases, making a rate increase   of 50 percent or more necessary.   \"He is fully dedicated to solving this thing, he doesn't just want to lay it   on the lap of a ratepayer or a taxpayer, and he's trying to come up with ways   to do that,\" Maviglio said.   The national attention the power problems draw is raising Davis' name   recognition around the country  ) for better or worse  ) as he considers   whether to make a presidential run in 2004.   Davis has been making the rounds on the national TV news and Sunday morning   talk shows to explain to the nation why the lights have been going out in   California.   He has attempted to shield himself by continually commenting that he   inherited the energy problems; then-Republican Gov. Pete Wilson signed the   1996 utility deregulation bill largely blamed for the crisis, and California   went years with no new power plants, Davis says.   Republicans turn the criticism back at him. The state GOP has already run   radio ads criticizing Davis' handling of the power problems and are launching   an all-out effort to blame him for the rate increases.   \"It's a colossal failure of mismanagement on the part of the governor's PUC,\"   said Assemblyman Keith Richman, R-Northridge.   But even with the energy crisis, Republicans have their work cut out for them   in 2002.   The state GOP  ) long shackled by infighting between moderates and   conservatives  ) is in the minority in the Legislature, holds just one   statewide office, Jones', and must come up with millions to match the nearly   $26 million Davis had raised nearly two years before the election.   And polls have shown residents growing increasingly frustrated with the   energy crisis, but not blaming Davis. Those surveys were taken before   Tuesday's rate hike and before California was hit last week with rolling   blackouts from San Diego to the Oregon border.   The governor's political campaign isn't taking any chances, moving quickly to   bite back at critics.   Garry South, Davis' chief political adviser, issued a statement Tuesday   saying Jones has failed to put forth his own solution.   \"Put your megawatts where your mouth is,\" South said.   ------------------------------------------------------------------  PUC Approves Largest Electricity Rate Increase in State's History     Regulation: Some customers will pay up to 46% more. Commissioners, facing   strong opposition before their unanimous vote, say they are trying to avert   blackouts. Critics say move won't solve the crisis.     By NANCY VOGEL and TIM REITERMAN, Times Staff Writers             PUC President Loretta Lynch and Commissioner Richard Bilas show strain of the   meeting at which the panel announced a rate hike. \"We maintain the   responsibility to keep the lights on,\" Lynch said  ROBERT DURELL / Los Angeles Times            ?????SAN FRANCISCO--With protesters jeering their disapproval, besieged   utility regulators Tuesday adopted the largest electricity rate hike in the   state's history and defended the action as the only way to keep the lights on   for millions of customers.  ?????The California Public Utilities Commission unanimously approved an   increase of 3 cents per kilowatt-hour. That will boost rates by as much as   42% for some Southern California Edison customers and up to 46% for some   served by Pacific Gas & Electric Co.  ?????The rate increase, which will cost customers nearly $5 billion a year,   takes effect immediately but will not show up on utility bills until at least   May.  ?????The rate hike is the most far-reaching and politically volatile action   the state has taken thus far to ease an 11-month-old power crisis that has   nearly bankrupted the two largest utilities and triggered blackouts. But   critics say it does not solve the fundamental problem of runaway wholesale   electricity prices.  ?????\"The PUC has done all it can do to fight wholesale energy prices that   are unjust and unreasonable,\" said commission President Loretta Lynch. \"We   maintain the responsibility to keep the lights on. . . . I believe that   adding another 3 cents will comprehensively address the need for revenues.\"  ?????The commission took steps to have utilities begin paying the state   Department of Water Resources for the nearly $3 billion in power it has   purchased for them since mid-January.  ?????The PUC also ordered utilities to start paying for future power from   alternative energy producers who are starved for cash and struggling to   operate. The blackouts last Monday and Tuesday were precipitated in part by   loss of power from such companies.  ?????But it was the rate increase proposal that packed the auditorium at PUC   headquarters. And the drama of the vote--and the vocal opposition--spurred   each of the five commissioners to forcefully defend the unpopular action.  ?????\"These are extraordinary moments in California's history,\" declared   Commissioner Geoffrey Brown, a recent appointee of Gov. Gray Davis. \"And   extraordinary moments require extraordinary courage. Loretta Lynch has taken   a lot of bad hits. But it was she who stepped up to the role of leader in   California.\"    ?????Rate Increase Lacked Support  ?????Lynch proposed the rate increase, even though an administrative law   judge at the PUC concluded that an increase was unnecessary and the PUC's own   consumer protection arm, the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, opposed it. She   also did not have the public support of Davis, who appointed her and two   other commissioners.  ?????Davis has distanced himself from the PUC's action, saying the commission   was acting independently and that he remains unconvinced that a rate increase   is necessary.  ?????Commissioners Henry Duque and Richard Bilas--who were appointed by   Republican Gov. Pete Wilson--called the rate hikes long overdue.  ?????\"Unless ratepayers want to face substantial rolling blackouts this   summer, we have to start paying our power bills,\" Duque said. \"It cannot be   done with the current rates.\"  ?????Saying \"there is just no blood left in the turnip,\" Bilas warned that   \"absent an immediate rate increase, the utilities will be in Bankruptcy   Court.\"  ?????Before the vote, sign-carrying protesters chanted, \"Rate hikes, no way,   make the energy companies pay.\" And the commission heard a parade of   witnesses, most opposing the rate increase. Some called on the state to use   eminent domain to seize power plants, as Davis said he might do as a last   resort.  ?????Doug Heller, of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa   Monica, told the commission, \"Go to these power pirates and tell them the   state treasury is not their money orchard.\"  ?????Barbara George, of Women's Energy Matters, said, \"We should give the   generators 24 hours to sign their plants over to the state and leave.\" George   was one of several people ejected for repeatedly disrupting the meeting.  ?????At a hearing Monday, representatives of agriculture and manufacturing   industries warned that the increase would hurt their members and the   California economy.  ?????The rate hike is the state's largest, according to the Office of   Ratepayer Advocates, which researched the issue.  ?????Because the electricity rate is just one of many charges on a monthly   utility bill, the overall effect will be about a 28% increase in monthly   bills, said PUC staff.  ?????Before the PUC action, homeowners and renters in Edison territory paid   7.2 cents per kilowatt-hour for electricity and another 5.3 cents per   kilowatt-hour for other services. The new rate, totaling 15.5 cents per   kilowatt-hour, boosts the overall bill by about 24%. The increase is about   26% for PG&E residential customers. But under Lynch's proposal, those   increases would not be applied equally.  ?????To encourage conservation, she seeks a tiered system that would charge   miserly consumers of energy no more than current rates but would impose the   new higher rates on bigger users.  ?????The proposal aims the rate increase at those customers who use 30% or   more beyond a so-called baseline amount, which is about half of the average   residential use per month and varies by region.  ?????Exactly who will pay the higher electricity rate will be determined by   the PUC in hearings over the next month. Under Lynch's proposal, nearly half   of all residential customers would be spared rate increases.    ?????Tiered Rates to Encourage Saving  ?????Energy experts say tiered rates would encourage conservation, but they   disagree about how much.  ?????Davis energy advisor S. David Freeman, general manager of the Los   Angeles Department of Water and Power, said utilities have long used tiered   rates when charging low-income customers. \"So this is not brand new. It's   just a more aggressive use of it,\" he said.  ?????UC Irvine economist Peter Navarro said he doubted that tiered rates   would do much to stave off blackouts. The greatest conservation gains come   from investment in efficient appliances, he said, and that's why tiered rates   are \"no magic bullet.\"  ?????The increase will not show up in utility bills until May at the   earliest, said Paul Clanon, chief of the PUC's energy division.  ?????The higher charges for electricity consumed between now and whenever the   new rate structure is incorporated in monthly bills will be calculated   retroactively and charged to future bills, Clanon said.  ?????Utility executives and consumer advocates all threw up their hands at   the question of whether the rate hike will be enough.  ?????\"Have we gotten the number right?\" Duque said. \"I don't know. I hope we   have. But this is a step in the right direction, and we'll return any money   not used to buy power.\"  ?????Bruce Foster, a Southern California Edison vice president, also said the   rate increase is a step in the right direction. \"Only time will tell,\" he   said, \"if it is sufficient to meet the need.\"  ?????In a statement, PG&E welcomed the PUC action as a \"dose of realism,\" but   said the commission left unresolved a host of issues, including how much   money the utility will have to pay for power that the state purchases for   PG&E customers.  ?????The PUC estimates that the increase will bring in an additional $4.8   billion annually from the 24 million people served by Edison and PG&E.  ?????But that amount doesn't go far in today's California wholesale   electricity market.  ?????The state and utilities spent $5.2 billion in January buying   electricity. The state, through the Department of Water Resources, has spent   nearly $3 billion in taxpayer money to buy electricity on behalf of the   utilities since Jan. 19 because power generators refused to sell to the   cash-strapped utilities.  ?????Money utilities collect from their customers, even with the new rate   hike, is expected to cover a wide array of expenses, including payments on   $10 billion or more in revenue bonds that the state hopes to sell this spring   to cover the state's cost of buying power.  ?????\"The numbers don't add up,\" said Jason Zeller, an attorney with the   Office of Ratepayer Advocates. \"Massive [additional rate] increases are my   concern. We are sticking a finger in the dike unless wholesale prices come   down.\"  ---   ?????Times staff writer Mitchell Landsberg in Los Angeles contributed to this   story.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------  With Energy Crisis Far From Over, Experts Say More Hikes Possible     Power: PUC action leaves questions unanswered, such as how to handle   utilities' debts, whether to buy grid.     By JENIFER WARREN and MIGUEL BUSTILLO, Times Staff Writers     ?????As painful as Tuesday's electricity rate increase will be for some   consumers, power experts across the ideological spectrum say California is   not yet close to being free of the energy crisis that has engulfed it and   threatened its economy.  ?????Because of that, still more rate hikes are possible, they say.  ?????Consumer advocates, power company officials, legislators and regulators   disagree widely on the causes of and cures for the state's problems. But they   agree that California's energy woes are dizzyingly complex. And the rate hike   makes nary a dent in many dimensions of the problem.  ?????\"Is it over? Heavens no!\" said Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg (D-Los   Angeles), who heads a state Assembly panel investigating summertime power   supply issues. \"It's a necessary step, but we're certainly not out of the   woods yet.\"  ?????The increase, along with another important action Tuesday by the PUC,   did resolve two major issues--how the state will continue to buy electricity   that the financially shaky utility companies cannot purchase and how   electricity consumers will repay California's treasury for those purchases.  ?????But the commission left unresolved a host of other questions: what to do   with the roughly $14 billion in debt the state's two biggest utility   companies racked up in recent months buying expensive power; whether the   state will buy the electricity transmission grid those utilities own; where   to find about $1.5 billion the utilities owe to producers of alternative   energy, many of whom have not been paid in months; and how to wrap up   negotiations to sign long-term contracts with generators to supply power in   years to come.  ?????Said PUC President Loretta Lynch: \"Until we can get wholesale prices   under control and get folks to conserve, we're going to be in this pickle for   a while.\"  ?????Resolving the issue of repaying the treasury for power purchases was   crucial because the state is spending $45 million to $55 million a day to buy   electricity. To cover those costs, the state is supposed to float bonds,   which would be repaid from electricity bills. But without the higher rates,   officials feared there would be no way to cover the bond payments. And   without the bonds, all state taxpayers--and not just customers of the private   utilities--would be on the hook for the debt.  ?????In addition to raising rates, the PUC on Tuesday approved a formula that   will determine the size of the bond issue, expected to be the largest of its   kind in U.S. history.  ?????The formula allows for $12 billion in bonds. The state's three major   private utilities, Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric and San   Diego Gas & Electric, will have to determine how much power the state is   buying for them--the figure is roughly 30%--and use a proportionate amount of   the money they collect from customers to pay the state back.  ?????A $12-billion bond issue is significantly larger than earlier estimates   that pegged it at $10 billion. But even the larger number is far less than   some believe will eventually be needed to cover the cost of power the state   is buying.  ?????Unless prices are stabilized, state Treasurer Phil Angelides and others   have warned, further bond issues may be needed. Those, in turn, could require   more rate increases.  ?????\"It's possible that, with the rate increase and if we do a good job with   conservation, it's possible that [the bonds] may be less,\" said state Sen.   Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Ray). \"It's also possible that, given the situation   this summer, where we have not been able to secure anything close to our   power needs . . . we could be paying significantly more.\"  ?????The rate increase, which kicks in only for customers who use   significantly more power than a \"baseline\" amount, is intended to ease the   situation by inducing conservation and thereby cutting demand--forcing   \"energy hogs\" to switch off spa pumps or pay the price, as Lynch put it.  ?????But no one can predict how the \"hogs\" will respond or whether the rate   hike--plus conservation incentives moving through the Legislature and the   completion of several new power plants this summer--will be enough to spare   the state from forced outages.  ?????Tuesday did little to fuel optimism. Despite temperatures far milder   than on a typical summer day, another Stage 2 energy alert was declared by   the state's Independent System Operator after imports dropped sharply. The   state avoided blackouts, \"but it was really close,\" a Cal-ISO spokeswoman   said.  ?????Some state forecasts have California squeaking through the hot months   with no outages, but private forecasters see at least 20 hours of blackouts.   And Reliant Energy, one of the power plant owners, predicts 1,100 hours of   blackouts in the state this year.  ?????Beyond the problems of supply, the state has still not resolved the   question of the utilities' debt. Edison and PG&E say they've lost nearly $14   billion since June because they have had to pay high wholesale power prices   that the state's deregulation law bars them from passing on to ratepayers.  ?????Although the PUC estimates that the rate increase will generate an   additional $4.8 billion in revenue annually, most of that will go to paying   off bonds and other expenses. None is earmarked to relieve the utilities'   debt.  ?????\"When you do the math, the amount of money just doesn't get you very   far,\" said Assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek).  ?????That is where buying the transmission lines is supposed to enter the   picture. Gov. Gray Davis wants the state to pay $7 billion for the lines.   PG&E and Edison could then use the infusion of cash to pay off their bills   and become credit-worthy once more.  ?????But negotiations over sale of the transmission grid seem to have bogged   down. Meanwhile, support for the deal in the Legislature appears to be   slipping. Republicans have long been opposed, but now support among Democrats   is waning.  ?????Keeley, a critic of the transmission purchase all along, believes that   the state should instead buy the utilities' hydro-electric generators,   contending that they would bring in revenue from the power generated at the   dams.  ?????\"We're just going to sink dough into that [transmission system],\" Keeley   said, adding that the grid needs an estimated $1 billion in repairs. The   hydro system, by contrast, would be a revenue-producing asset that could help   lower rates, he said.  ?????A related question--still unresolved--is the fate of the state's nearly   700 producers of alternative and renewable energy, which supply more than a   quarter of the electricity used by California consumers. In a separate action   Tuesday, the PUC ordered utilities to begin paying the producers--whose   megawatts are desperately needed and who, in many instances, have not been   paid since November.  ?????On Tuesday, the small producers delivered a little more than half of   their usual supplies to the utilities--a trend that has dragged on for   several weeks and last week helped nudge the state into blackouts.  ?????Producers welcomed the PUC's order that they start getting paid. But,   they said, the move failed to address back payments, estimated at $1.5   billion, owed by Edison and PG&E.  ?????\"Generators find it more predictable and less risky to operate in Third   World countries than they do in the state of California,\" griped Marty Quinn,   executive vice president and chief operating officer of Ridgewood Power LLC,   which owns three small gas-fired generators.  ?????Any move to resolve that issue, of course, would increase the debt owed   by the utilities.  ?????On another front, state negotiators are finding it difficult to seal   long-term electricity contracts at rates more favorable than those on the   volatile spot market.  ?????So far, only 22 contracts have been signed, in part because generators   are reluctant to commit to lower prices while they're still owed billions of   dollars by the near-bankrupt utilities. Experts say the power secured by the   current contracts will supply less than half of what the state will need this   summer.  ?????Despite all the unsettled questions, at least one utility analyst, Dan   Ford of the Lehman Bros. investment firm, said the PUC's actions should   remove the immediate threat of utility bankruptcy and begin to lift the   \"California cloud\" over electricity generators.  ?????But in a sign that the energy crisis is still causing concern on Wall   Street, Standard & Poor's said it would continue to carry a cautionary credit   rating for the state.  ?????The rating agency, which placed California on a \"credit watch\" after the   state government began spending millions to purchase electricity, said in a   news release that it was not clear whether the rate hike would be enough.  ?????Hovering in the background, meanwhile, is the threat of a ballot   initiative that could unravel whatever solutions state officials ultimately   craft. Leaders of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights have vowed   that any utility \"bailout\" would likely trigger a \"voter revolt.\"  ?????\"The rate increase certainly makes an initiative more likely,\" the   foundation's lobbyist, Doug Heller, said Tuesday. If Gov. Davis does not   protect the public from \"profiteers,\" Heller said, his group is ready to push   forward with an initiative in 2002.  ---   ?????Times staff writers Virginia Ellis, Dan Morain, Tim Reiterman, Nancy   Rivera-Brooks, Julie Tamaki, Nancy Vogel and Rone Tempest contributed to this   story.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------  NEWS ANALYSIS  Davis Keeps His Distance From Utility Rate Hikes     By DAN MORAIN, Times Staff Writer     ?????SACRAMENTO--Gov. Gray Davis, convinced that he can't win votes by   delivering bad news, avoided the task of telling Californians what virtually   all experts have been saying for months--that electricity bills are going up.  ?????Indeed, on Tuesday, the Democratic governor quickly moved to distance   himself from a rate hike of as much as 46% that was approved by the   California Public Utilities Commission, led by his appointee Loretta Lynch.  ?????That and other recent moves have thrown Davis' credibility into   question--even in his own Democratic Party.  ?????\"If you're the governor,\" said political consultant Darry Sragow, \"you   don't want to take the blame for a massive rate increase that is not going to   sit well with a lot of voters. You want to be in a position where you can   say, 'I didn't have a choice; my back was against the wall.' \"  ?????Davis describes his view of the situation as \"optimistic.\" He has called   it an \"energy challenge,\" not a crisis, even as the state's two largest   utilities border on bankruptcy, and the state experienced blackouts a week   ago, in mid-March, when electricity use was 50% less than it will be in the   summer, when demand is highest.  ?????Davis and his aides say the governor is fully engaged in the problem,   understands its many dimensions and is working long hours to solve it. But   the crisis wears on, and an increasing number of lawmakers, including fellow   Democrats, are alarmed.  ?????\"It's an energy crisis, not an energy challenge,\" said Senate Energy   Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey), who began warning of a   coming energy shortage 13 months ago.  ?????\"This is a major crisis,\" Sen. Don Perata (D-Alameda) said, \"and it   would appear he is overwhelmed by it.\"  ?????\"If you don't face reality,\" said Sen. John Vasconcellos (D-Santa   Clara), \"you can't possibly improve it. His posture has been baffling. I   lament what is going on. This is my beloved state, and we're in serious   peril, and it scares me.\"  ?????Many academics, utility executives, Wall Street analysts and legislators   concluded weeks and months ago that rate hikes were necessary, given the   soaring wholesale price of electricity. Even Davis has acknowledged that a   rate hike might solve the situation.  ?????\"Believe me,\" Davis said Feb. 16, \"if I wanted to raise rates, I could   have solved this problem in 20 minutes.\"  ?????But in a reaction that added to lawmakers' bewilderment, Davis said in a   statement Tuesday that the PUC action was \"premature because we do not have   all the appropriate finance numbers necessary to make a decision.\"  ?????\"Until we do,\" the statement continued, \"I cannot support any rate   increase.\"  ?????In taking steps to raise rates, Lynch may well end up taking substantial   flak for her governor.  ?????\"Recent polls show the PUC is very unpopular in this state,\" Sragow   said. \"Gray Davis is still popular. Voters clearly don't see a connection   between the governor and the PUC.\"  ?????Davis' aides say the governor didn't talk to Lynch before she acted.   Lynch, a frequent visitor to the Capitol, was in Sacramento late last week   and again Tuesday. She may not have spoken to Davis, but she did make other   top administration officials aware of her plans.  ?????Lynch could have decided to act on her own. The state Constitution gives   the commission authority to raise utility rates. But the governor is well   known as a micro-manager, involved in the most minute details of state   governance. Davis repeatedly has said he expects all his appointees to \"think   like I think,\" and not to act on their own.  ?????As recently as last week, Davis directed that the PUC take specific   actions to help ensure that alternative energy producers get paid.  ?????Davis has said the Legislature's job is to implement his vision. He has   said judges he appoints who later break from him on major issues should   resign. His appointees \"should not be free agents.\"  ?????So he strained his credibility by saying he was unaware that Lynch would   move to raise rates Tuesday, particularly given events that occurred late   last week.  ?????On Friday, Davis Finance Director Tim Gage and Susan Kennedy, one of his   top aides, met with Assembly leaders behind closed doors. At the meeting, a   participant warned that rates might have to rise 50% to 100%.  ?????Also Friday, a top aide to Davis told The Times that Davis' staff was   convinced that a rate hike was necessary, even as Davis continued to publicly   oppose it. On Sunday, a top Davis aide referred reporters to Lynch, who   confirmed that she would move to raise rates Tuesday.  ?????Two months ago, Harry Snyder of Consumers Union was defending Davis.   Now, Snyder, who has worked with Davis on various issues for decades, is,   like many others, raising questions about the governor's credibility, his   penchant for secrecy and his competence.  ?????\"Something is wrong,\" Snyder said. \"Either he is over his depth, or it   is hubris, or it is the great river in Egypt, 'Denial.' \"  ?????Here are some of the governor's statements and actions, since called   into question:  ?????* Davis held a news conference Feb. 23 to say he had reached an   agreement on a rescue plan with Southern California Edison that included a   deal to buy its massive transmission system for $2.76 billion. A final   package, he said, would be announced within a week, not only with Edison but   with San Diego Gas and Electric.  ?????A month later, a top utility executive described the talks as   \"dreadfully slow.\" Negotiations over a similar deal with Pacific Gas &   Electric, which he said back in February would be completed by now, are even   further behind.  ?????* Davis has refused to release details about contracts he signed with   independent generators to buy power. He said, however, that the contracts   accounted for 6,000 to 7,000 megawatts of electricity this summer, a   significant amount that would help protect the state from having to buy much   of its power on the far more costly spot market.  ?????Last week, when he released some scant details in a report on the   contracts, experts who read it concluded that California would be forced to   buy half or more of its electricity on the expensive spot market.  ?????* Davis brushed aside reporters' questions last week about the blackouts   that rolled across the state. He remained cloistered as the outages continued   for a second day, emerging only after they ended to announce a plan to ensure   that alternative energy producers would be paid. A week after he called on   lawmakers to quickly approve a bill that would help get them paid, the   legislation remains stalled.  ?????\"It is inept at all levels and doesn't encourage any confidence that he   can handle it,\" Snyder said. \"Moreover, it doesn't encourage us that he is   going to tell the truth.\"  ?????The energy crisis is perilous for Davis' reelection effort next year.   But the governor's strategy of being unremittingly optimistic and going to   great lengths to maintain his opposition to rate hikes, could be to his   benefit when he faces voters.  ?????\"Ethically,\" said UC Berkeley political scientist Bruce Cain, \"not being   forthcoming is worse. Politically, the more he can obfuscate, the more likely   it is some people will buy the obfuscation. . . . The reason we see   obfuscation is that obfuscation works.\"  ?????Not all politicians follow that maxim.  ?????Davis' predecessor, Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, held a news conference   in 1991, as California plunged into a recession, to announce that he was   pushing for what became the largest tax increase in state history, calling it   necessary to help erase a $14-billion deficit. Top advisors had urged him to   leave the delivery of such bad news to others.  ?????\"Any time you deliver bad news to voters you're taking a risk,\" said Dan   Schnur, who was Wilson's spokesman. \"But it is a much bigger risk to allow a   situation to fester, without preparing voters for decisions that have to be   made.  ?????\"Nobody likes pain,\" Schnur said. \"But they are much more willing to   tolerate it if they understand why it is necessary.\"  --------------------------------------------------------------------------    Federal Energy Agency Unlikely to Order Refunds     Power: Regulatory panel says much of the overcharge alleged by Cal-ISO is   beyond its jurisdiction, and questions whether the rest is \"excessive.\"     By MEGAN GARVEY and RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writers     ?????WASHINGTON--What are the chances that federal regulators will order   electricity wholesalers to refund $6.3 billion in alleged overcharges?  ?????Zero.  ?????Officials of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission have   already made clear that nearly $3 billion--almost half the total that   California's grid operator said last week was excessive--is off the table   because a statute of limitations puts alleged overcharges that took place   before Oct. 2 beyond their reach.   ?????As for the rest, lawyers familiar with the agency and industry observers   note that FERC has consistently hesitated to use its full legal authority to   enforce \"fair and reasonable\" rates because of difficulty in defining that   phrase. Some within FERC question how much of the \"excessive\" rates   documented by the California Independent System Operator fall beyond FERC's   jurisdiction--for example, rates charged by municipal power suppliers that   are not regulated by the federal agency.  ?????So far, FERC has ordered electricity wholesalers to justify or refund   only $124 million in alleged overcharges--just 5% of the amount that the   Cal-ISO has identified. That sum deals only with rates charged in January and   February 2001 during Stage 3 alerts--periods when electricity reserves fall   below 1.5%.  ?????FERC's approach to the alleged California overcharges will probably not   become any more aggressive as a result of the two new members it will soon   have. President Bush has picked two state utility regulators to fill   vacancies on the five-member commission, the White House announced Tuesday.  ?????The president plans to nominate Pat Wood III, chairman of the Texas   Utility Commission and a Bush ally, and Nora Mead Brownell, a member of the   Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, to the FERC governing board.  ?????Administration officials have indicated that Wood, 38, would assume the   FERC chairmanship, a position now held by Curt Hebert Jr., a staunch advocate   of energy deregulation.    ?????Shake-Up at FERC Was Expected  ?????The shake-up has been expected because of continuing complaints that   FERC has not been aggressive enough in dealing with high energy prices and   electricity shortages in California and elsewhere in the West. Hebert in   particular has angered California officials with his opposition to price   controls on wholesale electricity sales.  ?????Although the administration wants to appear sympathetic to California's   plight, replacing Hebert has been a problem because he is a protege of Senate   Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.).  ?????Cal-ISO officials--who pointed out that their $6.3-billion figure was   part of a study calling for stronger market controls, not for refunds--may   still formally ask FERC to augment the refund order for January and February.   FERC ordered wholesalers to justify $124 million worth of charges shortly   after Cal-ISO asked for $550 million in refunds for December and January.  ?????FERC's refund process reflects the ambiguities facing federal regulators   who oversee an electricity market that was designed to follow the law of   supply and demand. At stake may be the final bill for electricity used to   date in California as well as future rates.  ?????And the debate over the role refunds should play in addressing   skyrocketing wholesale electricity prices underscores diverging philosophies   of what went wrong in the California market and how to fix it. What role   should the government--specifically FERC, an agency with a mandate to ensure   \"fair and reasonable\" rates--play?  ?????\"The whole notion that there's such a thing as a just price is kind of   an anachronism from New Deal days,\" said Pietro Nivola, a Brookings Institute   scholar who studies regulatory politics. \"Especially as we move closer to   some form of deregulation, we've come to understand that the price is what   the traffic will bear. In this case, utilities simply have to be able to get   higher rates at the retail end.\"  ?????But others say FERC has failed to assert its authority, allowing the   wholesalers to operate with impunity.  ?????\"The message FERC has sent so far is, as long as you leave 10 cents of   every dollar in the bank we won't pull the alarm,\" said Mark Cooper, director   of research for the Consumer Federation of America.  ?????Some on Capitol Hill say a massive refund order by FERC--while highly   unlikely--would go a long way toward reining in wholesale prices. But FERC   officials and many economists say that view is myopic and may do more harm   than good, potentially discouraging new suppliers from entering a market   already too tight. The memory of the 1970s oil crisis and a prevalent view   among economists that government intervention made matters worse has informed   the views of some longtime government officials and observers.    ?????Refunds Called 'Inferior Remedy'  ?????A clear sign of FERC's reluctance to call for refunds came late last   year, when the commission issued its initial proposition for remedies for the   California price increases. FERC officials said at the time, \"Refunds may be   an inferior remedy from a market perspective and not the fundamental solution   to any problems occurring in California markets.\"  ?????The decision by FERC to scrutinize electricity charges only during Stage   3 alerts in January and February was harshly criticized earlier this month by   some lawmakers and utility company officials. They complained that the narrow   focus eliminated tens of millions of dollars in charges some observers   believed were outrageous.  ?????But even the $124 million questioned by FERC has been defended by the   wholesale companies. In briefs filed with the agency last week, they said   rates exceeding $430 per megawatt-hour--compared with a pre-crisis average of   $30 per megawatt-hour--were justified by the increased credit risk   wholesalers took in selling to near-bankrupt utilities that have billions of   dollars in outstanding debts.  ?????Duke Energy, which FERC has said overcharged California by $20 million,   signaled some room for compromise in its compliance filing.   ?????\"We would be willing to forgo collection of credit premiums for these   months provided we were paid the FERC clearing price,\" company president Jim   Donnell said this week. \"If we are not assured payment, the credit premiums   are obviously appropriate, and we would reserve our right to collect the   entire amount of the bids that are subject to the FERC order.\"  ?????Both of Bush's Republican nominees to the commission are expected to win   Senate confirmation. But they can expect a grilling from Sen. Dianne   Feinstein (D-Calif.), who has accused power suppliers of price-gouging and   FERC of doing little to stop it.   ?????\"Certainly, my vote would be dependent on whether they're going to be   responsive to the present situation,\" Feinstein said Tuesday, grousing that   the administration has been \"recalcitrant to the point of arrogance.\"  ?????Feinstein met Tuesday with Vice President Dick Cheney, head of a White   House energy task force, but she described the meeting as \"disappointing.\"   Feinstein also sent a letter to Bush asking to meet with him on the   California crisis, and adding a hand-written note: \"The West needs your help.\"  ?????A spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis said he hoped the new commissioners   would have a \"more sympathetic ear\" for the concerns of the Western states.  ?????But word of the nominations came as Bush reiterated his opposition to   price controls. \"Price controls contributed to the gas lines of the 1970s,   and the United States will not repeat the mistake again,\" he said in a speech   in Kalamazoo, Mich.  ?????The nominees drew praise from the Electric Power Supply Assn. The group   expressed confidence that they would be \"strong proponents of completing the   much-needed transition to truly competitive and vibrant power markets all   across the country.\"  ?????Neither Wood nor Brownell could be reached for comment. Wood said in a   statement: \"On our best day as regulators, we cannot deliver benefits to   customers as well as a functional market can. But the market must work right   first.\"  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------    Wednesday, March 28, 2001   A Painful Step   Electricity rate increase may help, but Gov. Davis is yet to offer an   understandable plan to end the crisis.     ?????By approving a whopping rate hike for big power users, the state Public   Utilities Commission finally has recognized the grim reality of the   electricity market in California, even if Gov. Gray Davis has not.   Electricity costs more these days, even aside from the piratical rates   charged by big generating companies at times during this emergency.   ?????The increase, while probably necessary, will not by itself solve the   crisis or prevent rolling blackouts this summer. The two biggest private   utilities, Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric, still are   saddled with as much as $13 billion in debt for past power purchases. State   government still is shelling out some $50 million in daily power purchases   and has committed as much as $40 billion to future power contracts. Davis   continues to negotiate a takeover of the utilities' share of the state power   transmission grid in exchange for paying off some of the utilities' debts.   ?????Despite all the hand-wringing and arm-waving, nothing that state   government has done since January has provided any significant new power   generation or conservation. Consumers are right to wonder what happened to a   promised statewide conservation campaign. After first ducking the power   problem, Davis launched a flurry of initiatives early in the year, most of   them still works in progress. But he still has not given the people an   understandable, coherent plan for getting out of this fix. Worse, he refuses   even to say how much the state is spending on power even as he plunges   Sacramento into the power business for decades into the future.   ?????The irony of Tuesday's rate increase is that the state might have dodged   much of the mess if it had raised rates three months ago. But Davis, seeking   reelection next year, insisted that the crisis be solved \"within the existing   rate structure.\" Late last week he attended a political fund-raiser at a Palm   Springs golf club while his staff was being briefed on the need for higher   rates, literally distancing himself from the act.   ?????The rate increase, which will be drafted over the next 30 days, affects   customers of Edison and PG&E but not residents of Los Angeles or other cities   with full municipal power systems. The stated intent is that bigger users,   particularly businesses, will pay higher rates and be encouraged to save   major amounts of power during the summer. Under one scenario, nearly half of   households--low and medium users--would pay no more than they do now. The   boost is also intended to compensate taxpayers for the state's daily power   purchases, although there is no assurance yet that the new rates will meet   the full cost. The increase should be structured to give ratepayers some   relief if lawsuits against power generators' exorbitant pricing are   successful in winning refunds.   ?????Those skeptical ratepayers who believe that the crisis is just a big   rip-off by the utilities and the energy companies will consider the increase   more of the same. You can't blame them, considering the lack of straight talk   from the governor, including his dodging of the rate issue.   ?????However, most state experts, including Davis' own utilities   commissioners, say the rate increase is a critical first step in solving   California's power problems. If Davis has a plan to fix the problem some   other way, he should present it in detail to the people of California now.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------------------  PUC Votes To Jack Up Power Rates   Tiered increases approved as protests disrupt meeting   David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer  Wednesday, March 28, 2001   ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle   URL:   http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/28/M  N231034.DTL   The bill finally came due for California's experiment with electricity   deregulation as consumers were hit yesterday with the largest rate increase   in state history, an average 40 percent jump in monthly power costs.   The immediate rate hike was unanimously approved by the Public Utilities   Commission during a rowdy meeting that was repeatedly interrupted by chanting   and jeers from protesters.   Highway Patrol officers were directed by PUC President Loretta Lynch to   remove several demonstrators from the packed San Francisco auditorium.   \"These are extraordinary moments in California's history, and extraordinary   moments demand extraordinary courage,\" PUC member Geoffrey Brown said before   the rate increase was passed.   The commissioners approved a new 30 percent increase and made permanent a   \"temporary\" 10 percent increase adopted in January. This will allow the   state's two largest utilities to charge customers an extra $4.8 billion a   year.   PUC members said higher rates will help overcome the wide disparity between   skyrocketing costs charged by power companies for electricity and the   relatively low amount paid by consumers under California's 1996 deregulation   law.   However, consumers' bills will not go up until a \"tiered\" rate system can be   introduced, requiring those who use more power to pay higher fees. That   system is expected to be in place by May.   Gov. Gray Davis, who has tried to distance himself from the PUC's move since   it was unveiled Monday, said in a statement yesterday that the rate increase   was \"premature\" and that he did not support the decision.   \"While I have opposed rate increases, if it becomes clear that a rate   increase is absolutely necessary for the good of the state, I will support   one that is fair and do my duty to convince Californians of its necessity,\"   he said.   Several PUC members acknowledged that such a huge rate increase might not   have been necessary had the commission acted sooner to remedy California's   power woes.   \"We should have done this in January,\" Brown said, \"but we didn't have enough   information.\"   \"This rate increase is long overdue,\" said Richard Bilas, who also sits on   the commission. \"We are finally transfusing some blood.\"   CONSUMERS PROTEST  If so, the donor -- ratepayers -- did not go willingly to the operating   theater. A number of citizens rose to speak at yesterday's meeting, and not   one was in favor of higher power rates.   \"This is being shoved down the people's throats,\" said Dorothy Diez, an   elderly San Francisco resident. \"Why don't they put the bills where they   belong and not on my back?\"   She and others called on state officials to take a harder line with out-of-   state power generators, which have reaped windfall profits by charging sky-   high wholesale prices for their electricity.   Consumer groups urged the PUC to support special taxes on the generators'   earnings or even seizure of the companies' California power plants.   \"Your actions are reprehensible,\" Ross Mirkarimi, a public-power supporter,   told the commission. \"Do not do Gov. Davis' dirty work.\"   The governor did not attend yesterday's meeting, but his presence nonetheless   loomed large over the proceedings.   Consumer advocates derided Davis' claims this week that he played no role in   the decision to raise rates. They noted that the governor's appointees hold a   majority on the PUC and worked closely with Davis on a variety of past   issues.   Davis' staff was briefed on the rate hike before the PUC publicized its   decision.   'DAVIS CONTROLS PUC'   \"Gov. Davis controls the PUC,\" said Doug Heller, assistant organizing   director of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. \"He is   responsible for the rate hike. We are paying more because of the failure of   his leadership.\"   \"It seems absurd that Gov. Davis is saying his own agency is acting without   his consent,\" said Susannah Churchill, head of energy policy for the   California Public Interest Research Group. \"He's just looking for political   cover.\"   The PUC decision was made on a day when California's grid operators declared   a Stage 2 alert, the first in a week, indicating that power reserves had   dropped below 5 percent.   When tiered rates are implemented, customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co.   will see rates go up between 9 percent for \"medium\" power users and 36   percent for \"heavy\" users.   Those who can keep power consumption to within 130 percent of pre-   established limits will see no increase beyond the 10 percent rate hike   adopted in January.   Customers of Southern California Edison will see rates increase between 8 and   27 percent.   Bruce Foster, an Edison vice president, called the rate increase \"a step in   the right direction,\" but said further increases may be needed to defray   soaring power costs this summer.   PG&E spokesman Ron Low said the San Francisco utility needs to study the   PUC's decision more closely before determining whether a 40 percent rate hike   will be sufficient.   \"The PUC has done all it can,\" said Lynch, the PUC president. \"We have fought   back hard in every venue possible against unjust energy prices.\"   NO FEDERAL HELP  In the end, though, she said state regulators were forced to admit that no   help would be forthcoming from federal authorities in capping wholesale power   rates, and that generators would continue exploiting California's chronic   electricity shortage.   \"We maintain a responsibility to keep the lights on,\" Lynch said.   Along the same lines, the PUC approved a requirement that PG&E and Edison   repay the state Department of Water Resources for about $4 billion in power   purchases made on the cash-strapped utilities' behalf.   The commission also passed a motion forcing PG&E and Edison to pay smaller   power generators for their output. Half of all such generators were shut down   during last week's blackouts because they had not been paid by the utilities.   However, the PUC is only requiring that utilities pay for future electricity   purchases, and did not address the millions of dollars in payments still owed   the power companies.   Ann MacLeod, executive director of the California Cogeneration Council, an   association of smaller generators, said that by avoiding the question of back   debt, the PUC's move will do nothing to restore plants to operation.   \"These generators will not come back online as a result of this decision,\"   she said. \"In fact, a greater number likely will have to drop offline.\"   Protesters chanting, \"Hell no, we won't pay,\" urged consumers after the PUC   meeting to not include the higher fees in upcoming bills.   \"This is just the beginning,\" said Medea Benjamin, who was among the   demonstrators evicted from the earlier proceedings. \"Rates will go up and up   and up.\"   What's Next   The McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill faces several more tests,   among them:   - An amendment by Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., that would double the   contributions that donors may make to candidates, PACs and some other   organizations. A vote is expected today.   - Sen. Mitch McConnell, the measure's chief foe, refused yesterday to agree   to allow a final vote on the legislation tomorrow. McConnell, R-Ky., left   open the possibility of using parliamentary maneuvers to block a final vote.

Over Baseline Usage: Amount of electricity used above baseline   quantities, at a higher rate.   HOW THINGS WOULD CHANGE  The primary areas in which a customer bill would change under the new system   would be:   1. The creation of a new line item in the Baseline Information box for   electricity used 130 percent above the baseline. The line would reflect how   much was used at that level and the rate for that usage.   2. A higher dollar amount in the Electric Energy Charge line item reflecting   the increase cost from the rate hike. .   SOURCE: PG&E Web site; interviews.

The board votes   5-0 to increase rates immediately for PG&E and Edison despite yells from   protesters. The increases are the largest in California history.   -- Stock in both utilities suffer slight losses after expectations of the   rate hikes Monday caused shares in PG&E Corp. to surge 29 percent and Edison   International's stock to gain 30 percent. Edison International closed down 39   cents at $14.16 a share. PG&E Holding Corp., parent of Pacific Gas &   Electric, closed down 55 cents at $13.20.   -- In a Tuesday afternoon conference call, Southern California Edison says it   will begin paying interest to its bondholders after weeks of failure to pay.   Company authorities say they have not heard whether the news will boost their   credit rating and do not specify a dollar amount for monthly interest   payments.   -- The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which is not attached to   the state power grid and is not affected by deregulation, issues a statement   Tuesday assuring that customer rates ``will continue to remain stable.''   -- Standard & Poors retains California's cautionary credit rating despite   state regulators' decision to raise electricity rates. The state has been on   a credit watch ``with negative implications'' since it began spending $45   million a day to buy electricity for customers of two nearly bankrupt   utilities. The crediw watch will remain in effect despite a rate increase   state regulators approved Tuesday.   -- President Bush says the electricity price caps sought by California's Gray   Davis and other Western governors would worsen the region's energy crisis   instead of helping cure it. In a speech to the Kalamazoo Chamber of Commerce,   Bush says price controls helped cause the gasoline crisis of the 1970s, and   he won't make the same mistake.   -- Joseph Fichera, the governor's chief negotiator on the purchase of   transmission lines, says he is exchanging drafts of proposed agreements with   Edison officials but won't say how soon a final agreement may be reached. He   says negotiations are continuing with PG&E and San Diego Gas & Electric.   -- State agencies announce a March 29 workshop in Ontario for developers who   hope to build peaking power plants in time for this summer. The event is   similar to one held two weeks ago in Sacramento. Peaking plants are used for   short periods when power supplies run low.   -- California's Independent System Operator declares a Stage 2 alert when   electricity reserves were approaching only 5 percent of available power. ISO   spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle says the alert was triggered when 1,000   megawatts was unexpectedly lost from the Pacific Northwest. WHAT'S NEXT:< ?-- The Davis administration continues negotiations with Edison, PG&E and San ?Diego Gas & Electric Co. over state acquisition of their transmission lines.< ?THE PROBLEM:<   High demand, high wholesale energy costs, transmission glitches and a tight   supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest and   maintenance at aging California power plants are all factors in California's   electricity crisis.   Edison and PG&E say they've lost nearly $14 billion since June to high   wholesale prices that the state's electricity deregulation law bars them from   passing onto ratepayers, and are close to bankruptcy.   Electricity and natural gas suppliers, scared off by the two companies' poor   credit ratings, are refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to   start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and   business customers.   ,2001 Associated Press ?   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------  Energy Nominees Would Give GOP Majority on Panel   Carolyn Lochhead, Chronicle Washington Bureau  Wednesday, March 28, 2001   ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle   URL:   http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/28/M  N139149.DTL   Washington -- President Bush nominated two new commissioners to the nation's   top energy regulatory body yesterday, retaining the current chairman who has   criticized California's handling of its energy crisis.   Bush tapped a fellow Texan, Patrick Henry Wood III, chairman of the Texas   Public Utilities Commission, and Nora Mead Brownell, a Pennsylvania public   utility commissioner, to fill two vacancies on the five-member Federal Energy   Regulatory Commission.   The appointments would give Republicans a 3-to-2 majority on FERC, as the   commission is known, and probably solidify the agency's opposition to   imposing wholesale energy price caps sought by California Gov. Gray Davis and   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, both Democrats.   Both nominations require Senate confirmation, and Feinstein indicated   yesterday that she might oppose the nominations.   \"I would hope they would come in and talk with me,\" she said. \"Certainly my   vote would be dependent on whether they would be responsive to the present   situation. Up to this point, the administration has been recalcitrant to the   point of arrogance. If that is the case with these new appointees as well,   they won't have my vote.\"   FERC regulates wholesale power markets and interstate natural gas pipelines.   Curt Hebert, named chairman by Bush earlier this year, will remain in his   post. Although Hebert's outspoken free-market views are in sync with the   administration's, there had been speculation that Bush would tap Wood for the   top job. Some thought Bush might want a familiar ally to head an agency that   used to be a regulatory backwater but now is among the most politically   sensitive spots in the administration.   Wood has overseen electric utility deregulation in Texas, which is scheduled   to open its market to competition Jan. 1, 2002, but based on a model that   differs significantly from California's scheme. Texas has attracted ample new   power generation since 1995, and is experimenting with partial retail   competition for commercial users.   Brownell helped oversee Pennsylvania's electricity deregulation, which is   cited as a successful contrast to California's experiment.   FERC has come under heavy political fire from California Democrats for not   cracking down hard enough on alleged price gouging of California utilities by   out-of-state energy producers.   Hebert has been sharply critical of California's response to its electricity   mess, once describing Davis' plan to take over the utilities' transmission   lines as \"nationalization.\" He is adamantly opposed to price controls and   enjoys the strong backing of fellow Mississippian and Senate Majority Leader   Trent Lott, who pressured the White House to keep him.   Hebert and Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham have voiced strong opposition to   price controls on wholesale electricity, arguing that would worsen   California's blackouts by discouraging electricity sales from outside the   state.   Vice President Dick Cheney, who met informally with about 10 senators in his   Senate office yesterday, also restated the administration's opposition to   price caps, telling Feinstein price controls would not work and citing their   failure in the Nixon administration.   Feinstein, who has said she equates helping California with the willingness   to impose federal price caps, called Cheney's response \"very disappointing.\"   \"There was really no overture,\" Feinstein said. \"There was very little   willingness to help. Not even an offer of help. It is truly amazing to me,   because this crisis is not going to be confined to California. . . . What we   really need is a period of price stability . . . and they keep going back to   Nixon and price controls and saying they don't work. We all know that, but   what we are seeking is an interim period of stability until we can increase   supply.\"   Tell Us What You Think -- Can you save 20 percent on your energy usage? Gov.   Gray Davis' administration is offering rebates to Californians who save on   power starting in June, and if you've got a strategy for conserving, The   Chronicle wants to hear it.

We gladly rally to trim our energy use by a few percent,   whether at home, at work or in our cars, but we ultimately feel little   urgency to change the overwhelming wastefulness of our built environment.   During the past two decades, we've done plenty of \"sparing at the spigot,\"   and that can only be applauded.   We've passed minimal building energy standards such as California's Title 24   but then wiped out much of the savings by building the sort of needlessly   bloated, energy-guzzling homes that now sprawl across acre after acre of once   pastoral landscape.   We've enacted minimum standards for gas mileage -- excepting SUVs, but you   don't drive one of those, do you? -- yet we've made little headway in curbing   our reliance on the automobile itself.   How did we get into this jam? A fair share of the blame for our disastrous   land-use policies belongs at the feet of the very people who insisted they   knew better: the postwar city planners.   They've left us our current legacy of hyperorganized zoning ordinances that   encourage -- in fact practically mandate -- urban sprawl. These in turn have   produced a national reliance upon the automobile that has only increased.   ON THE ROAD AGAIN, AND AGAIN  Flying in the face of all we've learned about the environment during the past   decades, the year 2000 set the all-time record for U.S. automobile sales,   with some 17.4 million cars and trucks sold.   And no wonder Americans remain auto-centered. Too many planners and state   transportation departments still consider freeway expansion programs the   solution to our mass transportation woes, even though it's been demonstrated   time and again that bigger highways merely invite more traffic instead of   reducing it.   We consumers are to blame as well, for buying into the idea that a   snowballing trend of consumption is the very embodiment of success. We're   hooked on big houses; but because housing prices are so high in the Bay Area,   we're willing to move out to less populated areas so we can afford them.   We willingly drive an hour or even two to get to work -- a commute that would   have been considered perfectly absurd even 20 years ago. Pretty soon, of   course, the new community is as choked with cars and asphalt as the old one.   The real pity is that we've recognized the folly of these trends for decades,   and we've done next to nothing to even protest them, let alone change them.   PLANNING FOR THE PAST  And thanks to the hidebound attitudes of so many civic planning departments,   little of substance has changed in our land use policy since the 1950s: Our   hyperorganized zoning ordinances still jealously guard the outdated postwar   ideal of the single-family home surrounded by largely useless strips of   \"setback\" land, and continue to frown on more intelligent arrangements such   as zero-lot-line construction, courtyard homes and mixed commercial and   residential planning.   By all means, save all the energy you can. But while any move toward   conservation is commendable, it's America's fundamental building practices   that really need changing, not the position of the light switch in your   hallway.

In a speech Tuesday to Wall Street and utility executives, Giuliani said a   surge in electricity prices last summer and an imminent shortage of power   supplies demand government intervention. Electricity bills rose an average 43   percent for New Yorkers last July.   ``The double-digit price increases that New Yorkers had to pay last summer   are just unacceptable,'' Giuliani said.   Giuliani said the move toward deregulation in the early 1990s was done   hastily and needs to be adjusted. Until more power plants are constructed, a   temporary price cap would protect consumers, he said.   A spokesman for KeySpan, a major New York-area energy producer, said such   price caps would likely discourage the construction of new power plants.   In California, deregulation, power plant maintenance and scarce   hydroelectricity have been blamed for an extended power crisis that has led   to rolling blackouts four times this year. On Tuesday, California regulators   approved rate increases of up to 46 percent for customers of that state's two   largest utilities.   ,2001 Associated Press ?   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------------------  Power regulators approve rate hikes of up to 46 percent   KAREN GAUDETTE, Associated Press Writer  Wednesday, March 28, 2001   ,2001 Associated Press   URL:   http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/news/archive/2001/03/28/state0  302EST0101.DTL   (03-28) 05:53 PST SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Sam Sahouria owns a small downtown   grocery and deli, a few blocks from the offices of the state Public Utilities   Commission. He now fears a decision by the PUC could force him to lose the   store he has run for the past 15 years.   Amid the jeers of protesters yelling ``Hell, no, we won't pay,'' the PUC   voted unanimously Tuesday to approve electricity rate hikes of up to 46   percent for customers of California's two largest utilities.   The increases for Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison   Co., which take effect immediately, are the largest in California history.   ``It's terrible, we will probably go out of business,'' Sahouria said. ``It's   very simple -- we cannot afford any rate increases.''   PUC commissioners, who voted 5-0 for the rate hikes, said they were necessary   to head off blackouts this summer and to keep the cash-starved utilities from   going under.   However, the PUC simultaneously ordered the nearly bankrupt utilities to pay   the state for billions of dollars of electricity it has bought on behalf of   their customers, and to pay producers of renewable energy for future   electricity deliveries.   ``The PUC has done all it can,'' commission president Loretta Lynch said.   ``We have fought back hard in every venue possible against these unjust   energy prices.''   Not all PG&E and Edison customers will face higher bills. The PUC said it   would create a tiered system that will protect low-income customers and   penalize those customers who use the most electricity.   Ratepayers have labeled the plan a ``rip-off'' that could hit as many as 10   million homes and businesses fighting to stay cool amid rolling blackouts and   spiraling energy costs. The rate hikes could effect as many as 25 million   Californians.   The increase is on top of a 9 percent to 15 percent rate hike the PUC   approved in January and made permanent Tuesday. An additional 10 percent   increase already is scheduled for next year.   ``Our bills have gone from $26 to $70 for a stinking studio apartment and we   don't have a heater, we use the oven to heat up the studio,'' said Belinda   Lazzerini, 40, who serves fruit smoothies at Jitters & Shakes in downtown San   Francisco. ``The laundromat has gone up from $1.50 to $3, so now we will have   to clean our clothes by hand and dry them in the basement. It's crazy.''   Though utilities still cannot set their own rates for electricity because of   a rate freeze mandated by the state's 1996 attempt at deregulation, the PUC   has the authority to increase rates. The rate freeze must end by March 2002.   The PUC meeting was disrupted at least five times by screaming protesters.   Before the meeting, a group led by former Green Party senatorial candidate   Medea Benjamin stood in the PUC chambers with yellow signs saying ``We Won't   Pay.''   ``We don't need increases in our bills, we need increases in law enforcement   so our governor can protect us from these modern-day robber barons,'' said   Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa   Monica.   Meanwhile, the state remained free of power alerts Wednesday morning as power   reserves stayed above 7 percent.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------------------          No explanation given after officials approve 27 percent rate hike   Posted at 10:00 p.m. PST Tuesday, March 27, 2001   BY STEVE JOHNSON     Mercury News       After months of waiting for the state's elected leaders to act, California's   Public Utilities Commission on Tuesday unanimously approved the largest   electricity rate increase in at least two decades, and offered no assurances   that more hikes won't be needed soon.   The 3-cent per kilowatt-hour increase would boost average rates for all   customers by 27 percent, although the precise residential and business rates   have yet to be determined. It is effective immediately and will show up on   bills in May.   The commission's vote in San Francisco played out against an odd political   backdrop: Gov. Gray Davis, who appointed three of its five members, said he   wasn't consulted about the planned rate hike and that he does not favor it.   But Davis, after learning Sunday night about the plan, apparently did not   seek to block the commission's action. Instead, he issued a statement   immediately after the vote that called it ``premature because we do not have   all the appropriate financial numbers necessary to make a decision. Until we   do, I cannot support any rate increase.''   The commission, however, said it had no alternative but to raise rates,   considering that the state in recent weeks has been forced to spend billions   in taxpayer funds on power because its cash-strapped utilities are no longer   credit-worthy.   But even some commissioners were uneasy. Davis' most recent appointee on the   commission, Geoffrey Brown, acknowledged during the Tuesday meeting that ``we   as commissioners had very little time to review this.''   In fact, an administrative law judge -- using much the same evidence that was   included in the decision to raise rates -- had concluded recently that no   such increase was justified.   The commission did not explain how it arrived at the increase of 3 cents per   kilowatt-hour. Previously, officials with Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and   Southern California Edison had only sought a 2-cent per kilowatt-hour   increase.   Experts pointed to a number of unanswered questions that make it uncertain   whether a 3-cent hike will bring in sufficient revenue to cover the enormous   cost the state has incurred since it began buying power.   The state still doesn't know how much its effort to bail out PG&E and Edison   -- which involves a state purchase of the utilities' high-voltage lines --   will cost. It's also unclear how much the state might wind up spending on the   expensive electricity spot market this summer, and whether an additional rate   increase would be needed to cover that.   ``Have we got the number right?'' asked Commissioner Henry Duque, in   reference to the 3-cent increase. ``I don't know. But I hope we have.''   Roderick Wright, D-Los Angeles, who chairs the Assembly Utilities Committee,   told the commission that he opposed the idea of approving any rate hike now,   until the state has a better idea of the total amount that consumers   ultimately will have to bear.   By establishing a 3-cent increase now, ``we'll be back in a short time,   potentially doing it again,'' he said. ``To be nickeled and dimed to death as   we're doing here, I don't think that does anybody any good.''   Signs of confusion   Utility officials sounded similarly unimpressed and confused.   ``While providing a welcome dose of realism,'' PG&E president Gordon Smith   said in a prepared statement, the rate hike and other actions taken by the   commission Tuesday ``do not offer a comprehensive solution, fail to resolve   the uncertainty of the crisis and may even create more instability.''   Among PG&E's major concerns is whether the utilities will be compensated for   their debts -- which they claim total about $13 billion -- and whether PG&E   or the state will be responsible for the cost of power purchased on the spot   market.   Bruce Foster, an Edison vice president, offered a similar lukewarm   endorsement of the increase. ``I'm not saying that it will do it,'' he said,   acknowledging the possibility of more increases down the road, but he called   the hike ``a step in the right direction.''   Rate hike vs. bankruptcy   Commissioner Richard Bilas said he feared that if the utilities were forced   into bankruptcy, the judge overseeing such a case could order much bigger   rate hikes to stabilize the companies' finances.   ``A rate increase designed by this commission is far better than one designed   by a bankruptcy judge,'' Bilas said, adding that he also was concerned about   how the state appeared to be buying electricity ``like a drunken sailor.''   But others reacted angrily to the commission's decision. Several protesters   hoisted signs at the meeting that read, ``we won't pay'' and chanted, ``rate   hikes go away, make the energy companies pay.'' Police later escorted them   out of the meeting after commission President Loretta Lynch became annoyed at   their noisy interruptions.   Instead of raising rates, they and other consumer advocates urged Davis to   use the state's power of eminent domain to take over the power plants   operated by companies accused of gouging the public.   ``The governor should start seizing plants until these crooks start playing   by the rules of society,'' said Mike Florio, senior attorney with The Utility   Reform Network in San Francisco. ``They're economic war criminals.''   Officials in Davis' office said Tuesday that they intend to review the   commission's action and decide over the next few weeks whether to support it   or seek changes. But to some people, the governor's claim of ignorance about   the commission's plan -- and his seeming inability to do anything to stop the   rate hike from being approved -- severely strained credulity.   ``Give me a break,'' said Sen. John Vasconcellos, D-San Jose. ``Who appointed   them and who's been giving orders all along?''   Davis did say for the first time Tuesday that he might be willing to consider   having consumers pay more for electricity. ``If it becomes clear that a rate   increase is absolutely necessary for the good of the state,'' he said, ``I   will support one that is fair.''       Dion Nissenbaum and Hallye Jordan contributed to this report.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  --------------------------------------------------          Impact of increases will vary greatly   Posted at 9:44 p.m. PST Tuesday, March 27, 2001   BY JOHN WOOLFOLK     Mercury News       The rate increases approved Tuesday will hit Californians in very different   ways: The heaviest users of electricity will probably pay the most, and   nearly half of residential users will likely see no increase at all.   Although the details aren't yet final, state regulators say they intend to   fashion a ``tiered structure'' to implement the higher rates. Here's how the   proposal will affect your bill:   When do the higher rates kick in?   Regulators consider the increase effective immediately but say it won't   appear on bills until May. While regulators agreed that rates will rise, they   still have to approve a structure for how customers will share the cost.   Hearings are expected next month. Once the structure is approved, regulators   say, utilities can apply it retroactively to Tuesday's rate approval.   Do the new rates affect all Californians?   No. The Public Utilities Commission, which approved the rate increase, has   authority over only investor-owned utilities: Pacific Gas & Electric Co.,   Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric, which together serve   about 10 million homes and businesses. The increase affects PG&E and Edison,   but not San Diego. Municipal utilities, including Santa Clara, Palo Alto,   Alameda, Sacramento and Los Angeles are governed independently and exempt.   How will the new rates work?   Regulators are planning a tiered rate structure in which large commercial and   power-guzzling residential customers pay a greater share. Residential   customers would pay more according to how much they exceed their ``baseline''   amount.   What is the baseline?   The baseline is considered the average household usage. It was established   years ago to encourage conservation by charging a higher rate for electricity   usage over that amount.   Does everybody have the same baseline?   No. Customers are assigned different baselines to account for variations in   electricity needs caused by regional climate, household type and season.   How many baselines are there?   PG&E residential customers in the San Francisco Bay Area are divided among   three climatic baseline territories: the coastal areas including San   Francisco and the Peninsula, the East Bay and South Bay, and the Santa Cruz   Mountains.   Within those territories, there are separate baselines for single-family   homes and multifamily apartment complexes, as well as for homes with only   electric appliances instead of both gas and electric.   In addition, baseline rates are adjusted for summer and winter usage. Summer   rates begin May 1, and winter rates begin Nov. 1.   How do I find out my baseline?   Your electric bill shows the baseline amount in kilowatt-hours and the rate   you are billed for that amount. It also shows how much power you used over   the baseline and the rate you were billed for it.   How does the baseline affect my bill?   Customers already pay about 14 percent more for power they use over their   baseline. Under the proposed tiered rates, PG&E customers who use no more   than 130 percent of their baseline amount wouldn't pay any more than they do   now. PG&E customers who use up to twice their baseline would see an average 9   percent increase in monthly bills. Those who use more than twice their   baseline would see an average increase of 36 percent. Edison customers would   have similar rates. Almost half of the utilities' customers don't exceed 130   percent of their baseline.   Why am I hearing different reports about the size of the rate increase?   The increase can be calculated many ways. The commission approved an increase   of 3 cents a kilowatt-hour, three times the 1-cent surcharge approved in   January, which was made permanent Tuesday. Because the 1-cent increase   averaged 10 percent, some have said that, plus the 3 cents, amounts to a   40-percent increase.   Others have added 3 cents to the amount the utilities charge just for   electricity, which for PG&E is now 6.4 cents, and come up with a 47-percent   increase.   Because total rates include transmission and maintenance surcharges, others   have added 3 cents to the average total rate of 11.14 cents for all   customers, a 27-percent increase. Under the tiered proposal, the average   residential rate would rise 20.8 percent from 12.46 cents to 15.05 cents.   But average bills for residents' bills would increase up to 36 percent,   depending on electricity use.   Can my business avoid the rate hike by saving energy?   The proposed tiered rate structure based on the baseline use doesn't apply to   commercial and industrial businesses. In fact, the proposal calls for a   proportionately greater increase for businesses, which pay lower rates than   residential customers. Commercial customers would see a 22.6-percent   increase. Industrial customers, generally over 500 kilowatt-hours a month,   would see a 41-percent increase.   But businesses can still get a discount on summer bills by saving power. Gov.   Gray Davis this month ordered 20-percent rebates for all customers who reduce   electricity usage 20 percent over last year between June and September.   Residential and small commercial rebates will be based on 20 percent   reduction of total consumption, while commercial and industrial rebates will   be based on 20 percent reduction of peak load.   If I qualify for assistance in paying my bills now, will I have to pay more?   Possibly. The proposal calls for exempting customers in the California   Alternative Rates for Energy program, and expanding eligibility from 150   percent to 175 percent of federal poverty guidelines. But commissioners   aren't ruling out tiered rates for those customers to encourage them to save   electricity.

The rate increases for Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California   Edison Co., which take effect immediately, are the largest in California   history, totaling $4.8 billion a year.   PUC commissioners said the increases were necessary to head off blackouts   this summer and to keep the cash-starved utilities from going under.

PG&E rates   would rise by as much as 36 percent and Edison rates by as much as 27   percent.   Not all PG&E and Edison customers will face higher bills.   The PUC said it would create a tiered system that will protect customers who   don't use much electricity and penalize those who use more.

State regulators at the Public Utilities Commission on Tuesday ordered   Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric to start paying   alternative-energy producers $79 per megawatt-hour. But alternative   generators that use natural gas say that's at least $20 below what it costs   to produce the energy.   \"On the short run, we can't generate,'' said David Lloyd of NRG Energy Inc.,   which this month shut down its 260- megawatt plant in the Bay area that sells   steam to the C&H sugar factory next door. \"It just costs so much for   electricity.''   Alternative generators have been paid little, or nothing, the past four   months and are now collectively owed more than $1 billion by the utilities.   The situation has prompted many of the small generators to scale back or shut   down their plants, resulting in a 2,900-megawatt loss to California - enough   to power 2.9 million homes. That was a factor in blackouts last week and the   state's Stage 2 energy alert Tuesday.   There are two classes of alternative generators: renewables, which use solar,   wind or clean-burning technologies to produce energy, and co-generators,   which use natural gas to produce energy but share the heat output with a   manufacturer. Renewables, which make up half of the 10,000 alternative-energy   megawatts, say they're likely to continue producing but would like to be paid   what they've been owed the past four months.   PUC spokeswoman Kyle Devine said $79 per megawatt-hour should work for   generators if the natural gas is transported through an Oregon pipeline - a   cheaper route - rather than through a pipeline from the Southwest.   But a gas proposal that Ken Ross of Delta Energy Co. in Santa Ana received   Tuesday showed the transportation price to be just as expensive.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ---------------              Bush to nominate 2 who favor free markets for energy panel   March 28, 2001   By DENA BUNIS  The Orange County Register   WASHINGTON President George W. Bush will nominate two new federal energy   regulators whose history indicates that, like him, they favor free markets   and don't favor price controls.   Bush said Tuesday that he will ask the Senate to confirm Patrick Wood,   chairman of the Texas Public Utility Commission, and Nora Mead Brownell, a   commissioner with the Pennsylvania PUC, to the five-member Federal Energy   Regulatory Commission.   Both Republican nominees have presided over the deregulation of their state's   energy markets, so far with more success than California.   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who sits on the Energy and Natural Resources   Committee, which will hold hearings on the FERC appointees, issued an early   warning.   \"Certainly my vote would be dependent on whether they would be responsive to   the present situation,'' Feinstein said. \"Up to this point, the   administration has been recalcitrant to the point of arrogance. If that is   the case with these new appointees as well, they won't have my vote.\"   However, neither is expected to have trouble getting confirmation.   Wood, PUC chairman since 1995, has said Texas' deregulation climate is   different from California's.   Unlike California, the Texas deregulation encourages long-term contracts.   Texas has more power reserves and it's easier to get a permit to build a   plant there.   Brownell has been on the Pennsylvania PUC since 1997.   Pennsylvania's market also differs greatly from California's in several ways.   The state is a net exporter of power while California is an importer, and   Pennsylvania's deregulation plan did not force utilities to sell their   plants.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------              Davis backs power rate hikes if 'necessary'   He says PUC approval of hikes Tuesday is 'premature.' S&P is unsure how   conservation will affect revenue.   March 28, 2001   By JOHN HOWARD  The Orange County Register   SACRAMENTO Gov. Gray Davis shifted his position opposing electricity rate   hikes, saying he would support them \"if it becomes clear it is absolutely   necessary for the good of the state.\"   The governor's statement Tuesday came just hours after the Public Utilities   Commission, a panel controlled by Davis' appointees, endorsed a plan to raise   monthly bills by as much 36 percent. The increase eventually would be tied to   a flexible rating plan in which light users will pay a little more, medium   users (those who conserve energy) will pay moderately more, and heavy users   will pay a lot more. Details of the plan are not yet set.   Davis called the PUC's decision \"premature,\" saying scant information was   available to justify increases.   \"While I have opposed rate increases, if it becomes clear a rate increase is   absolutely necessary for the good of the state, I will support one that is   fair and do my duty to convince Californians of its necessity,\" Davis said.   Boosting electricity rates to help resolve California's energy crisis is   likely to increase the state's $10 billion revenue bond sale to $12 billion   or more, entailing more interest charges and a longer payback.   Standard and Poor's, the Wall Street credit-rating agency, called the rating   plan \"a complicated formula that will only increase rates on heavy users of   electricity.\"   \"It is unclear exactly how many users will be affected, and whether revenues   will slip under the rate-raising formula as consumers respond by conserving   electricity,\" S&P said.   Also unclear is how the money from increased rates would be divided. The   state, which has been buying power on behalf of the utilities, says it has   first rights to the money. The utilities have challenged that.   California hopes to borrow $10 billion by selling revenue bonds in May to   cover its costs of purchasing emergency electricity since December. Through   April 7, those costs are expected to total $4.2 billion.   The bond money also will be used to pay for power under long-term contracts,   which is much cheaper than power bought just before it is used.   Critics have questioned whether $10 billion will be sufficient. PUC President   Loretta Lynch said the increased rates would support at least a $12 billion   bond sale. Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio and Joseph Fichera, a Davis fiscal   adviser, declined to discuss a specific amount.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  --------------------------------------              Cheney says state's on its own   March 28, 2001   By DENA BUNIS  The Orange County Register   WASHINGTON Sen. Dianne Feinstein says Vice President Dick Cheney on Tuesday   offered no hope of federal help for California's electricity crisis, and she   is once again appealing to the president to meet with her.   \"It was very disappointing,'' Feinstein said in an interview after a   45-minute meeting Cheney had with a group of 10 senators. \"I practically   begged for a period of reliability and stability so we could get through the   summer, and I didn't get any feeling back that there was going to be any   help.''   Cheney insisted, Feinstein said, that California has to \"straighten itself   out'' and was not moved by the fact that the Public Utility Commission was   poised to increase rates nearly 40 percent.   After the meeting, Feinstein sent President George W. Bush a two-page letter.   \"Your administration has not yet offered any constructive solution to this   problem,'' she wrote. \"If the federal government continues to ignore the   situation, the result may very well be economic disaster for millions of   small businesses and residents.''   Feinstein wrote a final plea that Bush meet with her and Sen. Gordon Smith,   R-Ore., who is co-sponsoring a bill authorizing short-term regional price   caps.   Bush on Tuesday reiterated his position against price caps in a speech in   Michigan.   Feinstein has heard little sympathy for her state from colleagues, who have   repeatedly said Californians have not felt any real pain. Rep. Jennifer Dunn,   R-Wash., recently complained that Californians were turning on their hot tubs   without worrying about paying higher costs.   Feinstein said such criticism is exaggerated. But she said she hopes the rate   increase approved by the PUC will show critics the state \"is doing the right   thing.''   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who said she was not invited to meet with   Cheney, said she was concerned that the rate increase would be \"making   consumers bear the brunt\" of the electricity crisis.   Before a rate increase is considered, Boxer said, the PUC should make sure   average residential consumers and small businesses are protected and take   whatever legal action is available against \"those generating companies who   colluded and unlawfully manipulated prices.   \"We should get something in return, some assets,\" Boxer added, also calling   on the utilities to contribute some of the money they diverted to their   parent companies.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------                Highest rate hike in state history raises consumer anger   O.C. residents and businesses resent 'energy hog' label.   March 28, 2001   By KATE BERRY  The Orange County Register   Helen Lewis, a Villa Park homemaker, believes the rate hike unfairly targets   families with children.   Dorothy Kascak, an 82-year-old Cypress resident who uses an oxygen machine   24-hours a day, is furious at being called an \"energy hog.''   And Vic Peterson, a homebuilder in Corona del Mar, has angry words for Gov.   Gray Davis for allowing the energy crisis to escalate, potentially   endangering the economy.   Throughout Orange County, residents and businesses responded angrily to the   approval Tuesday of a 3-cent-a-kilowatt-hour rate increase by the California   Public Utilities Commission.   \"There are a lot of handicapped citizens that are on fixed incomes,'' said   Kascak, who has been on an oxygen machine for eight years. \"If they raise our   rates 40 percent, what am I going to do?''   Though oxygen users typically receive a discount on their electricity rates,   they will be subject to the rate increase like everyone else, said Bruce   Foster, vice president of regulatory affairs at Southern California Edison.   Many businesses are concerned that higher power costs could push California   and the nation into a recession.   \"It's upsetting,'' said Peterson, who owns Peterson Construction & Design   Inc. \"Less money coming into California means less people purchasing. Who are   we going to sell homes to?''   At Panama Joe's Hair Design in Irvine, owner Joe Gayle said he has no choice   but to pay the higher rates. He's got hair dryers, electric hair clippers,   lights, a refrigerator, a microwave and computer to run a nine-station hair   salon.   Last month Gayle's bill was $234. A year ago it was $183. Now he expects it   to top $300 a month.   \"They jack it up because they know there is nothing we can do,\" he said.   Then there's the effect on families, especially those who live in large   houses.   The PUC will debate in the next month how to implement a tiered-rate plan,   with large users paying the highest rates. A plan proposed Monday by PUC   President Loretta Lynch targets what she called \"energy hogs\" by increasing   rates on usage over 130 percent of a consumer's minimum \"baseline\"   allocation, which varies by neighborhood.   For Lewis, the Villa Park homemaker, conservation will barely put a dent in   her electric bill. The 4,300-square-foot house she shares with her husband   and three children has a monthly baseline of 267 kilowatt-hours, while the   family's energy consumption routinely runs from 1,200 to 1,500   kilowatts-hours.   \"It's not as if we're leaving the lights on,'' said Lewis. \"But they are   taking people that have houses and have washers and dryers, and penalizing   them. Families will be hit very hard.''   Register staff writer Elizabeth Aguilera contributed to this report.         ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------                  Lighten up ... it's just a California thing   Outside the state, there is almost a smug satisfaction in our energy   failures. But most here remain optimistic.

California. Global trendsetter. High-tech nexus. Crucible for creativity.   The Golden State is raw fiscal muscle, with an economy bigger than China's   and twice the size of Canada's. But alas. California can't keep the lights   on.   \"It's amazing to think that we have the world's seventh-largest economy - and   a Third World power system,\" said Fred Smoller, chairman of the   political-science department at Chapman University. \"It's certainly a blow to   our collective ego.\"   Rolling blackouts finally hit Orange County last week. Workers were plunged   into darkness. Children studied by candlelight. Cars crawled through lawless   intersections. Elevators halted between floors, libraries checked out books   by hand, and portable generators were rushed to sewer-lift stations to keep   raw sewage from spilling into the ocean.   Outsiders scoff. Californians are a gaggle of goofy tree-huggers guilty of   \"mass myopia\" and \"willful energy abnegation,\" charged Charles Krauthammer,   columnist for the New York Daily News.   \"Californians refuse to acknowledge that in the real world, their desire for   one good (an unsullied environment) might actually conflict with another   desire (hot water in their Jacuzzis).\"   Sensing weakness, other states are pouncing.   Glow-in-the-dark mouse pads saying \"Michigan. We never leave you in the dark\"   are landing in the mailboxes of California CEOs. Alongside flashlights   boasting \"The lights are always on in Tennessee.\" And nine-volt batteries,   courtesy of the Greater Raleigh (N.C.) Chamber of Commerce (\"In the dark   about where to grow your business?\").   \"Our CEO got the flashlight pitch,\" said David Sonksen, executive vice   president and chief financial officer of Microsemi Corp. in Santa Ana. \"But   he threw it away. It would take 10 years of exorbitant power costs to even   make a dent in the costs associated with moving.\"   Clever ambulance chasing, Orange County Business Council Vice President Bill   Carney calls it. And while some companies say they'll think seriously about   expanding, it doesn't seem like anyone intends to leave.   \"California has it all over everywhere else. Sorry!\" said Lisa Green, a vice   president for Entridia Corp. \"The power thing is a little bit of a pain, but   not that much of a pain.\"   \"I'll take sweltering on a summer day over a Michigan winter any time,\" said   Laer Pearce, a public relations consultant in Laguna Hills.   Which is not to dismiss the seriousness of the crisis. \"I'm concerned about   what it means for our economy,\" said Naomi Vine, director of the Orange   County Museum of Art, whose offices went dark without warning one day last   week. \"If businesses can't be productive, what does that mean for the year   ahead?\"   \"It's really scary,\" said Pearce, who held his breath as the lights went out   in buildings across the street last week. \"This is one that, when they were   studying California's infrastructure, nobody even predicted. What's going to   happen with the sewers and roads and airports and everything else?\"   Indeed, the crisis may be exposing the weak spots in California's go-go   economy.   One concern is that production shifted this year from California to more   energy-reliable areas might never return, Carney said. And if, even for the   short term, California businesses are perceived as being unreliable suppliers   because they have unreliable power, the effects could be lasting, he said.   Others worry about the effect of outages on people themselves. As a culture,   we've becoming utterly dependent upon electricity to work, to play, to   communicate. \"Everything we do is electric,\" said Pearce. \"We just couldn't   go back to knocking it out on a manual typewriter anymore.\"   And it's starting to sink in that things will get worse before they get   better, said Al Milo, director at the Fullerton Public Library, which lost   power briefly last week.   But things will get better, the stubborn optimists say.   \"This is a great thing that's happening,\" said Gerran Brown of Brown Colonial   Mortuary in Santa Ana. \"Energy prices may go up temporarily, but people will   learn to turn lights off and not drive gas-guzzling SUVs, and eventually   we'll have a truly free market where the consumer will win.\"   California will emerge from this darkness stronger than ever, with new   technologies, a new conservation ethic and a new emphasis on alternative,   renewable forms of energy. \"It's a new opportunity for us to be an   international leader,\" Carney said.   Carney was hosting two Korean businessmen last week when there was a great,   sudden click and lights went out at the Business Council's office. \"They told   me politely, to make me feel better I'm sure, that they have blackouts in   Korea, too,\" Carney said.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------                Conserve and save   A proposed tiered-billing format is designed to spare low power users from   the rate increases. Baseline is the bottom line.   March 28, 2001   By ANNE C. MULKERN  and KATE BERRY  The Orange County Register   The state's power crisis hit your wallet Tuesday when state regulators hiked   electricity rates as much as 36 percent.   Your bill could be headed up as a result. Here are answers to some of your   questions about the rate hike:   Q: How much more will I pay?   A: Details of the plan haven't been finalized. But the idea is to create a   three-level rate structure. Those who use more electricity will pay the   highest rates and those who conserve will save.   Consumers who use less than l30 percent of their baseline power allocation   will escape any increase. (We explain baseline below.)   The rate increase will be distributed across the two higher tiers. The Public   Utilities Commission over the next 30 days will come up with a plan to   determine exact rates for the two higher levels, as well as for different   types of customers, such as residential and small business.   Q: So what is baseline?   A: Baseline is the portion of your usage considered necessary for essentials.   To encourage conservation, it's set below the amount most people use.   The percentage of Edison customers who use less than 130 percent of baseline   is roughly 48 percent in winter months and 45 percent in the summer.   Because baseline is set based on the average household's use, it means a   single person living in an apartment can have the same baseline as a   homeowner with four children.   Baseline varies depending on where you live. Warmer areas get higher   baselines. There are different baselines for the summer and winter. People   who use medical equipment in their homes can get higher baseline allocations.   All-electric homes get higher baselines.   Q: What's the reason for this rate hike? Are they really doing this to get   people to conserve?   A: Conservation is a side benefit. The primary motivation is money.   The state has already shelled out $3 billion buying power in the last three   months for customers of the near-insolvent utilities.   The state plans to issue bonds, which will be paid for by consumers, to cover   the power purchases. But Wall Street bankers must have proof of a steady   revenue stream - a rate increase - to convince them the bonds can be repaid.   However, people inevitably will conserve if they are paying more for their   power, so the plan will also help reduce demand.   Q: I'm already conserving. How can I cut my bill further?   A: It's nitty-gritty time. Replace your incandescent light bulbs with   fluorescent bulbs. Clean those coils at the back of your refrigerator. Turn   your air conditioner down or off. Reduce the amount of time you use your pool   pump.   Many items in your house use electricity when they are plugged in, even if   they're not in use. You can cut consumption by unplugging your television,   computer, coffeepot, toaster and blow dryer.   Q. When will I pay the increase?   A: The rate hike takes effect immediately. But it could take Southern   California Edison a month to 45 days to implement it, so you could face   retroactive charges on a follow-up bill.   Q. I live in south Orange County and buy electricity from San Diego Gas &   Electric Co. Does this plan affect me?   A: No. SDG&E has applied for a rate increase, but state regulators have not   yet voted on that request.   Q. I'm outraged. We didn't ask for deregulation and now we're paying more.   How can I protest?   A: Call or write you state lawmakers and the governor. You can also join one   of the consumer groups fighting the rate hike, such as the Foundation for   Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. It is at (310) 392-0522. The Utility Reform   Network is at (415) 929-8876.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------          National Desk; Section A   RECORD RATE HIKE SET IN CALIFORNIA   By EVELYN NIEVES   ?   03/28/2001   The New York Times   Page 1, Column 1   c. 2001 New York Times Company   SAN FRANCISCO, March 27 -- California's power regulators approved the largest   utility rate increases in state history today in an effort to avert more   rolling blackouts and keep the state's principal electricity producers from   collapsing in bankruptcy.   Despite Gov. Gray Davis's repeated statements that no new rate increases   would be needed to keep the state's two largest utilities solvent, the State   Public Utilities Commission said today that it had no choice but to raise   rates by up to 46 percent for customers of the two utilities to avoid a   greater catastrophe if the companies went bankrupt.   ''We have fought back hard in every venue possible against these unjust   energy prices,'' said Loretta Lynch, the commission president and a Davis   appointee, who had proposed the increases on Monday.   Ms. Lynch said that under a tiered rate system that would be hammered out   within the next 30 days, heavy power users would face the greatest increases   while light users would face little or no increases. Customers will see the   rate increases in their May utility bills.   Perhaps 45 percent of consumers under this system -- including the poorest   residents, who would be exempt -- will face no increase at all, Ms. Lynch   said. Heavy users will face increases of about 36 percent, she said.   Coupled with the average 10 percent temporary rate increase in January that   the commission made permanent today, those consumers will pay 46 percent more   for utilities than they did in December.   But even people who use small amounts of power and do not see their rates   increase could feel the impact if commercial power customers, from small   businesses to megastores, pass on their higher electricity costs through   price increases.   Before the rate increases, power costs in California were slightly higher   than the national average, but lower than the prices paid in New York and   other Northeastern States. Residential electricity users already pay an   average of about $65 a month, state officials say. In addition, under a   previous commission decision, rates will go up an additional 10 percent next   year.   The commission, which approved the rate increase 5 to 0, also voted to   require that the two large utilities, the Pacific Gas and Electric Company   and Southern California Edison, reimburse the state's Department of Water   Resources $4 billion spent on their behalf and begin paying alternative   energy generators, which account for more than a quarter of the state's daily   energy needs. The two utilities have not paid their bills for months, saying   they are nearly bankrupt because under deregulation of the power industry,   wholesalers have been allowed to float prices while retail rates were capped.   The Department of Water Resources has spent $45 million a day since January   buying power on the utilities' behalf. Small alternative energy producers had   not been paid at all for months, with dire consequences. For two days last   week, the state's power managers were forced to order rolling blackouts   across parts of the state, in part because the small energy producers shut   down half their capacity because they had not been paid.   The rate increases will make the payoff more feasible, Ms. Lynch said, while   encouraging energy conservation. But a representative of the state's   alternative-energy generators, known as qualifying facilities, complained   that the commission did nothing to address the roughly $1.5 billion the   utilities owed producers.   ''I'm not sure what our options are at this point if the state wants the   qualified facilities to be a part of the solution,'' said David Fogarty, a   spokesman for the Western States Petroleum Association and alternative-energy   co-generators, representing about 50 alternative-energy producers in   California.   For those on all sides, the commission seemed to raise as many questions as   it answered. Consumer advocates, who interrupted the hearing five times,   questioned why the commission had decided on the vote so abruptly, with only   24-hour notice to the public. Spokesmen for each of the utility companies   said they had no idea what the rate increases would mean to the average   customer until the tiered system was determined. They also said they did not   know whether these new rates would mean the end of rolling blackouts.   ''They may know something that I don't know,'' said Bruce Foster, vice   president of regulatory affairs at Southern California Edison, speaking of   the commission's vote outside the hearing room.   Mr. Foster also complained that the commission's directive to begin paying   bills to the state and the alternative energy producers -- or face a penalty   equal to the amount owed -- might be illegal and said that the company would   look into appealing it.   Ron Low, a spokesman for Pacific Gas and Electric, also complained that the   commission's actions seemed rushed and lacked specifics.   The rate increase will generate about $2.5 billion a year for Pacific Gas and   Electric, unit of PG&E and $2.3 billion for Southern California Edison, a   unit of Edison International. While those revenues will help the utilities   buy power on the wholesale market in the future, the commission made no   provision for paying off about $13 billion in debt accumulated by the   utilities as a result of past wholesale costs. That issue would be left to   the governor and state legislators.   The commission heard public comment before the vote, but did not answer   questions afterward. Consumer advocates were furious, many blaming Governor   Davis.   The governor today issued a statement calling the commission's move   premature. ''From the beginning, I've said that my main goal was to solve   this problem while protecting the consumer from undue rate hikes,'' Mr. Davis   said. ''The P.U.C.'s action today was premature because we do not have all   the appropriate financial numbers necessary to make a decision.''   Mr. Davis's statement seemed to reflect the awareness he and his aides feel   about the potential political backlash from big rate increases. Even as other   politicians warned that such increases would be necessary, Mr. Davis has   vowed to avoid them. On Monday he insisted that he had not spoken to any   members of the commission about the rate increase proposal and that he had no   control over its actions.   But Mr. Davis appointed three of the body's five members, and since taking   office two years ago he has been emphatic in saying that he expects his   appointees to state boards and commissions to reflect his policies.   He also did not hesitate to complain that he could not control the previous   members of the commission, because they were Republican appointees, and his   aides acknowledged that top gubernatorial advisers had consulted with Ms.   Lynch and approved her plans.   Politicians in both parties said Mr. Davis was trying to shift blame for any   rate increase to the commission while claiming that increases were approved   over his objections. They predicted that that effort could backfire by making   Mr. Davis look both timorous and calculating.

Regulators Raise Power Rates      By KAREN GAUDETTE  Associated Press Writer  SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ As protesters jeered ``Hell, no, we won't pay!''   California regulators approved electricity rate increases of up to 46 percent   Tuesday to head off blackouts this summer and keep the state's two biggest   utilities from going under.   The increases _ approved 5-0 by the Public Utilities Commission _ are the   biggest in California history and take effect immediately for the 25 million   people served by Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison   Co.   ``The PUC has done all it can,'' commission president Loretta Lynch said.   ``We have fought back hard in every venue possible against these unjust   energy prices.''   The PUC also ordered the utilities to pay the state for billions of dollars   of electricity it has bought on behalf of their customers. Just how much   wasn't known; the state has not disclosed how much it has spent on various   long- and short-term power contracts.   For the rate increase, the commission said it will create a tiered system   that will protect poor people and penalize customers who use the most   electricity.   Lynch proposed the higher rates as a way to force ``electricity hogs'' to   conserve and to help keep SoCal Edison and PG&E solvent.   The plan is also seen as a way to protect California's budget surplus, which   is being drained of $40 million to $50 million a day as the state buys power   for the cash-strapped utilities. Since the crisis began, more than $4.2   billion in taxpayer money has been spent to keep the lights on.   SoCal Edison and PG&E say they have lost more than $13 billion since last   summer because of high wholesale electricity prices and because California's   1996 deregulation law prevents the utilities from passing those costs on to   their customers.   Both have urged the PUC to raise rates. Following the PUC meeting, SoCal   Edison said it will begin paying interest to bondholders after weeks of   missing payments.   The rate increase will be on top of the 9 percent to 15 percent hike approved   by the PUC in January, and a 10 percent increase already scheduled for next   year.   Ratepayers and consumer groups branded the latest plan a rip-off.   ``We are being held hostage by a handful of energy companies that, under   deregulation, got control of our electricity supply,'' said Harvey   Rosenfield, president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in   Santa Monica. ``Until our elected officials start acting to protect us, we   are going to be at their mercy, at the mercy of this ripoff.''   Democratic Gov. Gray Davis has said that he opposes rate increases but that   he has no power over the PUC. However, three of the PUC members are his   appointees. And his aides have told lawmakers that rates have to rise.   Residents already pay about $65 per month for electricity _ 7.2 cents per   kilowatt hour to SoCal Edison and 6.5 cents per kwh to PG&E.   The latest rate hike would mean a 42 percent increase for SoCal Edison   customers and 46 percent for PG&E customers for electricity alone. Since the   rates are bundled with other fees, the average price of a kilowatt hour is   closer to 12.5 cents for SoCal Edison customers and 10.5 cents for PG&E   customers.   Spokesmen for both utilities said it is impossible to calculate how much the   plan will cost customers because the effects of the tiered system are not   known.   The PUC meeting was disrupted at least five times by screaming protesters,   and dismay over the plan was seen elsewhere.   Sam Sahouria, owner of the Fox Plaza Grocery and Deli in San Francisco, said   rate hikes could be too much for his family-run store to bear. ``It's   terrible. We will probably go out of business,'' he said.   Belinda Lazzerini, 40, who serves fruit smoothies at Jitters & Shakes in San   Francisco, said her electric bills have jumped to $70 for her studio   apartment.   ``The Laundromat has gone up from $1.50 to $3, so now we will have to clean   our clothes by hand and dry them in the basement,'' she said. ``It's crazy.''   The state has pledged to issue at least $10 billion in revenue bonds to buy   power for SoCal Edison and PG&E _ bonds that would be repaid by the   utilities' customers. However, state officials have told lawmakers that state   efforts to help the utilities could hit $23 billion by 2003.   California's Independent System Operator declared a Stage 2 alert Tuesday as   electricity reserves dropped to about 5 percent.   The alert follows two days of statewide rolling blackouts last week and two   others in January. ISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle said many power plants   that use alternative sources of energy remained down, in part because haven't   been paid by the utilities.                        ",

(AP) via NewsEdge Corporation  - State lawmakers began investigating Friday whether market manipulation helped drive up California's natural gas prices, hearing from a consumer who spoke of the ``terrific shock'' she got from a recent bill.   Natural gas costs six times more in California than in other states, said Assemblyman Darrell Steinberg, chairman of the Assembly Energy Oversight Subcommittee.   Natural gas that sells for $5.25 elsewhere sells for nearly $30 at the California border, said Steinberg, D-Sacramento.   ``We're going to examine every possible reason for the price spike,'' he said.   The hearing by Steinberg's subcommittee and the Natural Gas Costs and Availability Subcommittee opened with testimony from utility customers.   Gladys Cook of Sacramento told the committee her Pacific Gas and Electric Co. natural gas bill rose from about $47 or $57 a month last year at this time to $344.63 in February and $112 this month.   ``It was just a terrific shock, especially after the Christmas holiday and everything,'' said Cook, who lives with her 87-year-old mother, a retired teacher. Cook said they turned down the heat and water heater to try to reduce their bills.   Officials from PG&amp;E, Long Beach Energy, San Diego Gas &amp; Electric and Southern California Gas were also expected to testify.   Lawsuits filed this week by Long Beach and Los Angeles accuse several utility companies of meeting at a Phoenix hotel in 1996 and deciding to block construction of gas pipelines that could have helped the state avoid its power crisis. The companies deny any collusion.   High natural gas prices are just one factor in the state's energy crisis.   A tight electricity supply, caused in part by maintenance at California power plants and scarce hydroelectricity in the Pacific Northwest, has contributed to rolling blackouts four times this year, including twice statewide this week.   The hearing comes on the heels of a state audit released Thursday that says California's 1996 deregulation law encourages market manipulation by electricity buyers and sellers.   And the California Independent System Operator, which oversees most of the state's power grid, told the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that electricity suppliers have overcharged it and the state Power Exchange at least $6.2 billion since May for power the two bought on behalf of utilities.   The excessive charges will continue during high demand this summer unless the commission steps in, the ISO said. The ISO buys emergency electricity to avoid blackouts.   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which Gov. Gray Davis and many lawmakers contend isn't doing enough to control California's energy prices, declined to send a representative to the Assembly hearings. However, other regulators were slated to testify.   The state Senate plans hearings next month to investigate whether electricity suppliers withheld power to raise prices. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -------------------------------------------------------------------------  Calif. May See Rise in Power Bills    By JENNIFER COLEMAN Associated Press Writer SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) via NewsEdge Corporation  - The state's power purchases for two struggling utilities could cost $23 billion by the end of next year, leaving customers paying at least 50 percent more for electricity, The Associated Press has learned.   State officials told several key legislators Friday that the state's efforts to help credit-poor Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. could hit $23 billion by 2003, a legislative source told the AP on condition of anonymity.   That's far more than lawmakers and Gov. Gray Davis estimated when they approved legislation authorizing the state's power purchases.   At the time, they projected they would need $10 billion in revenue bonds to buy power for the two utilities over a decade. The bonds would be repaid by the utilities' customers over several years.   Davis has said repeatedly he is confident the state's power crisis can be resolved without further rate hikes, but the source said cabinet secretary Susan Kennedy, Finance Director Tim Gage and Deputy Chief of Staff John Stevens all warned lawmakers that customers' rates would have to be raised at least 50 percent to cover the new projections.   That increase would come on top of a 9 percent to 15 percent increase the Public Utilities Commission approved in January, as well as an additional 10 percent increase already scheduled for next year.   Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio confirmed that Kennedy spoke with top Democrats on Friday but declined to elaborate.   The source said the calculations were by the administration, not the PUC, which would have to implement any rate increases. Lawmakers weren't told over what time frame such an increase would need to be implemented, the source said.   Consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights promised a rebellion at the ballot box in 2002 if rates continued to rise.   ``If this goes through, this is the beginning of the ratepayers' revolt,'' he said.   The PUC is expected on Tuesday to address how customer rates will be divided between the state and the utilities.   SoCal Edison and PG&amp;E both have pushed for rate increases, and PG&amp;E has said its current rates would be insufficient to cover its bills and the state's. Both say they've lost more than $13 billion since summer due to high wholesale electricity costs that California's 1996 deregulation law prevents them from collecting from their customers.   PG&amp;E's and Edison's credit was cut off by electricity wholesalers in January, and the state has been spending $40 million to $50 million a day since then to keep the lights on for their customers _ about $4.2 billion in taxpayer money so far.   State Controller Kathleen Connell warned this week that the state's power-buying is gutting California's budget surplus and putting the state at financial risk. Wall Street has also been wary. The Standard &amp; Poor's credit-rating agency put the state on a credit watch ``with negative implications'' when the power purchases began.   California has faced an energy crunch for months, fueled by high natural gas prices, soaring wholesale electricity costs and a tight power supply due in part to California plant maintenance and scarce hydroelectric power in the Pacific Northwest.   The Assembly on Friday opened hearings into the skyrocketing natural gas costs that will include an investigation into whether market manipulation helped drive up prices.   Pacific Gas and Electric Co. customer Gladys Cook of Sacramento told the committee her natural gas bill rose from about $50 a month last year at this time to $344 in February and $112 this month.   ``It was just a terrific shock, especially after the Christmas holiday and everything,'' she said.   Natural gas that sells for $5.25 elsewhere sells for nearly $30 at the California border, said Assemblyman Darrell Steinberg, chairman of the Assembly Energy Oversight Subcommittee.   The cities of Los Angeles and Long Beach filed lawsuits this week accusing several gas companies of conspiring to drive up prices by limiting supply. The lawsuits say the companies decided in a Phoenix hotel room in 1996 to block construction of gas pipelines that could have helped the state avoid its power crisis.   Rick Morrow, vice president of customer service for Southern California Gas Co., denied executives at the meeting were conspiring to drive up gas prices.   ``There was no mystery to the meeting,'' he said. ``What is being alleged is absolutely false.'' ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ---------------------------------------------------------------------  BPA to Link New Generation to Northwest Energy Grid    PORTLAND, Ore., March 23 /PRNewswire/  via NewsEdge Corporation  - The Bonneville Power Administration signed agreements with Goldendale Energy Inc. this week to connect the power from a proposed 248-megawatt gas-fired combustion turbine to the Northwest energy grid.   \"BPA is eager to act quickly to bring a new power resource online at a time when the Northwest and the entire West Coast are suffering from an extreme shortage of energy,\" said BPA's Acting Administrator Steve Wright. \"This project can help meet the Northwest's energy needs as well as help contribute to bringing down high energy costs.\"   The Goldendale Energy Project is to be built in Goldendale, Wash. The developers expect to have the new combustion turbine plant running by July 2002. The merchant plant will sell its output into the wholesale market. Some power may serve the nearby Goldendale Aluminum Smelter.   In the agreement signed between BPA and Goldendale Energy Inc., the energy company will pay BPA $1.6 million to construct, operate and maintain a 230-kilovolt terminal at BPA's Harvalum Substation. Klickitat County Public Utility District will build a new 9.2 mile transmission line from the generation project to the substation. The terminal will make it possible for the new power to be integrated into the Federal Columbia River Transmission System. BPA has agreed to have the terminal operational by Jan. 15, 2002.

The company's President and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling said during a phone conference Friday that there is only a 5% chance that it will  be able to sell PGE. He added that Enron is not in a rush to sell the Oregon utility since it is a profitable business.   Nevada electric utility Sierra Pacific agreed to buy PGE for $3.1 billion in cash and assumed debt in November 1999, and the transaction was expected to close in the second half of 2000. Enron decided to sell PGE since a regulated utility no longer fit with its strategy to buy and sell energy on wholesale markets.   But a new California law that prevents power generators from selling power plants has stalled the deal. Sierra Pacific, which has some operations in California, intended to sell some of its plants to AES Corp. finance the acquisition.   The Nevada Legislature also is considering a moratorium on power plant sales, according to Sierra Pacific spokeswoman Faye Anderson. She said Sierra Pacific is still confident the deal will close by the end of the second quarter.   Enron also said it will begin trading a liquefied natural gas contract on its Enron Energy Services Web site this summer. The LNG business in North America has been booming in the last year, and Skilling said he expects it  will continue to improve as U.S. natural gas supplies are squeezed.   Skilling said Enron still expects to earn between $1.75 and $1.78 per share this year. He also said the company's fundamentals are sound, and he doesn't understand why the stock has fallen to the $50s from a high of $90.75 in August.   \"It's a bad market, but Enron is in good shape,\"  Skilling said.   On Friday, shares of Enron rose nearly 8% to close at $59.40.  End   [slug: ENRON-PORTLAND-GENL]",

During yesterday's meeting, Jack Hawks sat in and VOTED for his boss, Lyn Maddox (Services - PG&E Energy Trading).  Jack has been very involved in the Wholesale Electric Quadrant.  Immediately after the meeting, Boswell and Jay Costan were questioned about this voting.  Jay stated it is allowed per NAESB governance, but then determined it is not.  After some dancing and backpedaling, they noted that the resolution would go out for notational vote.  I don't have the vote count on the adoption of the quadrant procedures.  The promotional dues would not have been adopted without Jack's vote. Shelley -- You asked what company Boswell works for.  I've been told that he is a \"non-employee officer\" of Dominion.  The NAESB listing of Board members states he is \"Assistant Secretary, Dominion\".  He is also a partner at McGuire Woods -- same firm as Jay Costan.  During meetings (including non-NAESB), I've heard him introduce himself only as Chairman of NAESB's Board of Directors; he doesn't give a company affiliation.  His e-mail address is McGuire Woods. The voting on quadrant procedures did not synch up with my discussion with Rae.  She stated the votes would be simple majority; super majority votes were taken.  Some people feel NAESB officers were concerned that some segments would not support the procedures, which would bring NAESB to a standstill.  My call to Rae may have piqued their curiosity and raised concerns.  We'll see whether this item remains on Jay Costan's list of errors in the bylaws. Bill Boswell will soon appoint Board members to the new Parliamentary Committee.  It will consist of two members from each Quadrant (not each Segment) and will address governance issues (e.g., Certificate, Bylaws, Operating Procedures).  It's been suggested that the Pipeline Board members should try to get a seat on that committee.  Recommendations from the Parliamentary Committee should still be voted by the entire Board.  However, their recommendations from a Board committee will have a good chance of being adopted.  My feeling is that Ron Mucci may be interested; I've heard no discussion.  RATES AND REVENUE (RRS) I've met with Gerry Medeles and Jim Studebaker to discuss RRS.  Initially, I'll attend most meetings to get up to speed and to help where I can with business requirements.  I'm also reviewing as much of the documentation as possible to gather information.  TRADING PARTNER AGREEMENT (TPA) I've met with Mary Draemer to discuss our pro forma TPA.  It's my understanding that we are using the language of the GISB (NAESB) standard agreement.  We don't know the history of our TPA, but at some point the standard agreement was reformatted and the GISB standard number and copyright info was deleted. I'll prepare our pro forma TPA, based on the GISB standard.  I'll add certain pieces of information, which we include in our posted pro forma, to the standard agreement.  This will be routed to the attorneys to give them a quick heads-up.  I'll explain that the content has not been changed. I'll prepare the agreements for UBS and send to them for execution.  The agreements will then be routed to the attorney and then to Shelley for execution. Shelley -- Will you sign for NNG?  If not, who will sign?   NAESB EDM SUBCOMMITTEE The EDM Subcommittee has begun having frequent meetings.  They have three requests on their plate in addition to their requirement to review the appendices in the EDM book to determine whether updates are needed for the technical characteristics.  The requester wants their changes included in version 1.6.  And, most feel the updates to the appendices are needed in version 1.6.  I'm still working with Terry Lehn on EDM matters.  MOVING NEXT WEEK My move is scheduled for next Thursday; packed by Wednesday.  I'll do some cleaning out to downsize from office to cubicle.  I'll leave some files in the 47th floor file room until I can go through them.  I want to make sure I have electronic copies before I throw away Board and EC books, standards, etc.  I'll work with Donna Scott on storage.",

		"_body" : "In regard to our meeting yesterday, detail for lockbox information is not received until mid afternoon the day after deposits are made. The detail for the 72,107.31 deposit will not be received until sometime this afternoon.  This amount is yesterday's deposit, 2/19.  Also, as discussed in yesterday's meeting your request for detail on the $36,513.47 2/1 item is an \"ACT Transfer CR\", and is not an incoming wire. It will not be recorded as an incoming payment. In prior discussions and emails,  we have indicated the $350.00 on 2/1 is a  NON TRADE item; the $600.00 on 2/12 is a NON TRADE item.  The $40,807.85 wire received 2/15 from FPL is for customer 700000031, and was applied to the appropriate misc invoices on 2/19.  In the future in viewing deposit amounts for the lockboxes and we indicate there are no trade deposits, the items will be treated as Non Trade items.   I trust this will resolve the outstanding questions.  thanks,  sandy",

The form seems to be the same, except it is intended to be sent to the Republic of Kazakhstan in New York.  Is that really where we are sending our registration information?  What about the autobiography.  What is that, What is required?    I understand the urgency in registering and am prepared to do what it takes to accomplish this today.  But, frankly this whole process was a surprise to me.  Does your agency have an written materials on follow-up requirements/processes in general.  I'm sort of at a loss on the whole issue of what comes next.  When to apply for SS#.  What about readoption.  Passport, Certificate of Citizenship, etc.  I was surprised when a resident alien card arrived.

We will discuss company updates as well as questions about the PEP system.      In addition, I have arranged for HR to conduct a training session on Effective Performance Feedback on Thursday, November 29 in Room ECN 5C2 from 1pm-3pm.  Roger Sumlin of the ETS Performance Improvement group will lead the session.  The concepts and techniques covered will help you be more effective in any feedback situation, such as providing feedback in PEP and in interactions with team members.  Roger will talk about what affects a person's openness to feedback and what a feedback giver needs to do to meet the feedback receiver's needs.   He will also review examples of good and bad statements entered in PEP and performance evaluation forms and talk about the importance of providing specific, useful and honest feedback that includes behavioral examples.

		"_body" : "  Dear Phil, Mary Kay, Dave, Don, Shelley and Lynn,   Drew asked me to send this latest version of Dave's proposed special test response letter to each of you for your review and authority to send out.  I have received comments from Mary Kay, Don, Drew, and Rick, and hope I adequately captured them.  If I have missed something critical, of course please let me know immediately.     Mary Kay will note that I said nothing about a potential C6+ problem that she has mentioned in her comments.  That is because I thought I was told that all the gas that we are now flowing and would reasonably expect to flow to Bushton could be routed through the rich stream and measured by one pair of meters.  If I understand Mary Kay's point, the C6+ problem arises only if you have so much unprocessed gas coming in you have to bypass the plant and take the unprocessed gas straight to the customers, which might cause downstream freeze-offs, etc.  Mary Kay, if the C6+ problem is a different problem, let me know.  Also, it is absolutely critical that we feel confident that we can send all the unprocessed gas through the rich stream for the indefinite future.  Can the right person tell us with authority that this is the case?   We are proposing NMI as our choice of testing facility.  I know that we very concerned about the effect in any future litigation about testing at CEESI, given Steve Caldwell's role in the past arbitration, and are considering using the Transcanada testing facility.  Bill Frasier has recently mentioned that the Transcanada test facility may have a substantial problem with swirl in the gas flow upstream of the test meters.  Further, if we use any test facility but NMI's, we face the risk of having the inherent bias of that test facility being thrown at us as evidence of meter inaccuracy with regard to past periods.     ONEOK will reply that CEESI is by far the lowest cost alternative among CEESI, Transcanada, and NMI, given that our equipment is apparently within trucking distance of the CEESI lab.  Bill Frasier has kindly agreed to review the various cost-scenarios will hopes to have an estimate to us (comparing the cost of flow testing at CEEI vs. Transcanada vs. NMI) by tomorrow afternoon.  I assume that CEESI will probably be the least expensive and least time-consuming alternative.     A good solution to the testing facility issue was suggested by Dave, with Grant's additional refinement,  which is to have an agreement that if we use CEESI, then neither Caldwell nor any of the CEESI employees could be called as fact or expert witnesses in any subsequent litigation.  Further, Grant suggested that we also require that the inherent bias in a certain percentage be factored out of any calculation of inaccuracy.   As part of his analysis, Frasier will also be looking at one-pair testing scenarios vs. two-pair testing scenarios.  The one-pair testing scenario is item #6 in the current draft; the two-pair testing scenario was item #7 in the last draft, which I have deleted in this draft.  The reason for deleting it is primarily cost.  I have not been able to think of any argument under which we could reasonably require ONEOK to be liable for all the costs of special testing the lean meters.  Drew and I discussed that the flow testing of the rich meters may answer a lot of problems; the swapping out of the original lean meters onto the rich line in the process may also give us some valuable information.   One risk of the one-pair scenario is that we think the lean stream meters may actually be measuring slightly in ONEOK's favor.  If we put the lean stream meters on the rich stream and the variance between plant loss as measured by our meters and the plant PTR Meters in fact significantly decreases, ONEOK may use this as evidence that the lean stream meters are measuring more accurately than the rich stream meters.  We may then be in a position of being forced to ask for a special test of the remaining pair of meters.   At this point, I am thinking that we will deal with that problem if it in fact arises.   Apologies for the lengthy e-mail; I await your comments.   Britt      ",

		"_body" : "Note:  With Dynegy as anchor, NGPL is planning on building a lateral into St.  Louis for the first time.  MRT (a Reliant pipeline) has been the only pipeline into this market.     NGPL Plans Lateral to Serve Illinois Power in St. Louis  Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) announced plans to build a new  47-mile, 24-inch diameter pipeline lateral into St. Louis to serve Illinois  Power's gas distribution system. The $35 million project, which is anchored  by a contract with Illinois Power affiliate Dynegy Marketing and Trade, will  add at least 300,000 Dth/d of gas transportation capacity to the St. Louis  market.   \"The pipeline project and related agreements ideally demonstrate our ongoing  strategy to expand our natural gas pipeline services into growing markets  currently not connected to NGPL and to increase throughput on our system by  adding electric load to our extensive pipeline network,\" said Richard D.  Kinder, CEO of Kinder Morgan Inc., the parent company of NGPL.   The new lateral will extend from Centralia, IL, to a point on Illinois  Power's gas distribution system in the East St. Louis market. The project is  scheduled for completion in June of 2002.   NGPL and Dynegy entered into a number of long-term, gas transportation and  storage contracts, including a 10-year agreement effective June 1, 2002,  which will provide Dynegy with 90,000 Dth/d of gas via the new pipeline. In  addition, NGPL and Dynegy entered into various other firm transportation  agreements totaling another 98,000 Dth/d of gas sourced from NGPL's Gulf  Coast and Amarillo lines beginning as early as Dec. 1, 2000.   The NGPL project effectively creates a new supplier for a geographical area  that until now has been served by just one natural gas transportation company  [Mississippi River Transmission], according to Larry F. Altenbaumer,  president of Illinois Power. \"This new connection to Illinois Power's system  will help open competitive opportunities to natural gas customers in the  metro east area of St. Louis. It not only provides for a new delivery point  to service customers directly, but also to fuel electric generation in the  area.   \"The 10-year agreement to provide firm transportation service to Dynegy  provides us a solid anchor customer for the pipeline project,\" said Deb  Macdonald, president of NGPL. NGPL intends to solicit expressions of interest  from other shippers in December and January. The results of the open season  will determine the final scope of the project.   \"With Dynegy as our anchor customer, we will build the new lateral into the  St. Louis market regardless of whether we receive other expressions of  interest,\" said Macdonald. \"We anticipate a strong response, however, given  the size of the market and the potential for additional gas-fired power  generation.\"   Interested shippers should contact Mark Menis, NGPL's director of business  development, at (630) 691-3347.

		"_body" : "Dave heard back from Terry Spencer of OneOk today that OneOk has changed its position on a couple of key issues.  First, Terry indicated that OneOk now agrees that the arbitration award is not limited in effect to just the past period.  They agree that the award interprets the measurement agreement, and that the interpretation is not limited to just the retroactive effect.  It is not clear how broad they think the prospective effect of the award is, but any change is significant on this issue.  Second, Terry indicated that OneOk is very likely to ask for a special test of the meters as a way of resolving the April-May issue, and, implicitly, the issue of whether the meters are OK going forward. This is also a big change, as OneOk has refused to call a special test since the initial demand letter we sent them last Fall.    Spencer indicated OneOk was drafting a letter that would clarify their position.  In light of that, and of the apparent progress Dave made, Stan has agreed we should hold off on the demand letter until we see their letter.  Once Dave gets it, we'll all take a look and decide the next step.  Thanks.  DF      ",

While we do not expect any problems with this maintenance window, we need to make sure we have a plan in place to not impact the customers.   This Saturday night,  October 27, starting at 10:30 pm fiber maintenance will be performed in the wiring closet on EB41.  During this maintenance window the jacket that covers and protects the fiber will be pulled back tight and secured.  This fiber connects the 41st floor wiring closet with the server room on 41, where the TMS servers are located.   While we do not expect this maintenance to have any impact, if we do have any issues with the fiber it can be replaced within an estimated 2 hour window.  Outage impact would then be lose of connectivity with the Enron LAN from that server room, therefore TMS would be unavailable.    At 10:30 pm on Saturday night, Mark Cowley from the server team will contact the HotTap Helpdesk to get approval to start the maintenance window.  The maintenance window will not begin until all processing for the pipelines is complete.  If we have any problems or issues he will contact me and I will start the escalation process.      If you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call.   Thanks.

The California Independent System Operator is urging consumers to continue   conservation measures during today's Stage One Electrical Emergency.   \"The conservation efforts of Californians, particularly Tuesday evening, were   significant and helped to reduce the duration and impact of yesterday's   blackouts,'' according to officials. \"The California ISO asks customers to   continue their voluntary reductions during this time of tight supply.\"   More than 11,500 megawatts of in-state generation remain unavailable with   power plants completing repairs and needed maintenance. However, several   generating units returned to service today and the level of imported power   has increased, boosting the supply.   \"The ISO is cautiously optimistic that customer outages will be avoided   today,'' according to officials.   Today's Stage One alert is in effect through midnight tonight.   Stage One Emergencies are declared when power reserves fall below 7 percent.   Stage Two kicks in when reserves fall below 5 percent. Stage Three is   initiated when reserves drop to below 1.5 percent.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  --------------------------------------------------------------------------    Calif State Controller:General Fund Surplus Dn To $3.2B      03/21/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service  (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)    LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- California State Controller Kathleen Connell   Wednesday said the state's general fund surplus has dropped to $3.2 billion   from $8.5 billion in January, mostly because of electricity purchases made by   the state's Department of Water Resources, a press release said.   Connell also denied Gov. Gray Davis' request to transfer an additional $5.6   billion from the general fund to the Special Fund for Economic Uncertainties,   the release said.  Connell noted that, given the rapid depletion of the general fund on power   purchases, the state would need to borrow $2.4 billion in order to tranfer   the $5.6 billion from the general fund to the special fund.   \"We started this year with a generous budget surplus. The energy crisis has   taken much of that away, and this transfer on top of the electricity   purchases would put the fund at risk,\" Connell said.     Connell called on Davis to ensure that the CDWR completes by the end of May   2001 the revenue bond sales that will be used to buy power and repay the   general fund.   She also asked that the CDWR notify her of all power purchases made and   contracts negotiated thus far and requested that she be told within 7 days of   any purchases and contracts negotiated in the future.   Connell also said she wanted to be told within 24 hours of any power buys   that exceed $55 million and asked that the Department of Finance be directed   to prepare new general fund cash flow estimates for the next 30 and 60 days,   and for the end of the fiscal year.   The state's Department of Water Resources has been buying power since January   in lieu of Edison International (EIX) utility Southern California Edison and   PG&E Corp (PCG) utility Pacific Gas and Electric Co, because suppliers   refused to sell to the nearly-bankrupt utilities.   -By Jessica Berthold; Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872;   jessicaberthold@dowjones.com     Gov. Davis' office said, in response to Connell's comments, that the state   budget was solid and the economy remained strong.   \"We will be getting the money back we've paid for energy and it should have   no significant effect on the state's finances from the Wall Street   perspective,\" said Davis press secretary Steve Maviglio.   -By Jessica Berthold; Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872;   jessicaberthold@dowjones.com  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  --------  Davis says regulators will act to pay QFs  Electricity providers insist they need to be paid  By Russ Britt, CBS.MarketWatch.com   Last Update: 9:45 PM ET Mar 20, 2001  LOS ANGELES (CBS.MW) - California Gov. Gray Davis said regulators will act   Tuesday on a plan to guarantee that independent power generators are paid.  Independent power producers provide about 30 percent of California's   electricity from a variety of sources including wind, solar and other   sources. Because many of the companies, known as Qualifying Facilities, or   QFs, haven't been paid they've begun to withhold power, contributing to   blackouts in the state Monday and Tuesday.   \"We are anxious to pay the QFs because they're falling like flies,\" Davis   said at a news conference late Tuesday. \"If they don't get paid, the lights   will go out.\"  Davis said the state's PUC order will require the state's nearly bankrupt   utilities to enter five-year contracts with the QFs at rates of 7.9 cents per   kilowatt hour, or 10-year contracts for lower rates. The structure is similar   to rates Davis claims he was able to negotiate for long-term power contracts   from out-of-state generators.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -------------------------------------  Rash power bill may need fix  By Will Shuck  From our Sacramento Bureau  SACRAMENTO Even as lawmakers lament the slow pace of solving California's   energy crisis, the cost of haste has cropped up in their first major act, a   multibillion dollar measure that put the state in the power-buying business.     AB1X, the highly touted bill that put California in the power-buying   business, may have been so rashly crafted that it will take another piece of   legislation to fix it, an influential senator said Tuesday.   At issue is vague wording that makes it unclear when and to what extent   Southern California Edison and other utilities have to repay the state for   buying power.   State Sen. Debra Bowen, chairwoman of the Senate Energy, Utilities and   Communications Committee, said the bill apparently has left room for utility   lawyers to argue that their companies needn't repay the state until they have   covered other costs.   But Bowen, a Redondo Beach Democrat who represents downtown and western Long   Beach, said \"the legislative intent is crystal clear\" that the state wanted   to be repaid directly for supplying about a third of the power utility   companies deliver to their customers.   \"We need a cleanup bill\" to set the matter straight, she said.   Although AB1X illustrates the flaws that come with speed, Bowen said, the   Legislature can't afford to delay.   \"I think we are much too slow in our response,\" she said. \"But that has to be   balanced against things we've done in a tearing hurry and then have had to   fix later.\"   No matter what the Legislature does in the coming weeks, she said, California   is in for a tough summer, and only determined conservation efforts will put   much of a dent in a precarious supply-demand equation.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -------------------------------------------  PUC considers rewarding producers that sign long-term contracts   Greg Lucas, Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau  Wednesday, March 21, 2001   ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle   Sacramento -- Some cash-strapped producers of wind, solar and other   alternative forms of energy will get long-delayed financial relief under a   proposed order by state regulators, Gov. Gray Davis said yesterday evening.   A proposed order by the Public Utilities Commission is designed to reward   energy producers who sign long-term contracts with utilities at lower rates.   Alternative energy producers that voluntarily enter such contracts, which   would start on April 1, would be paid within 15 days, said Davis, who   requested the order. Those that do not would have to wait until the utilities   that buy their power return to solvency.   Davis blasted Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison for   not paying the alternative generators -- know as qualified facilities, or   \"QFs\" -- even though the companies have been collecting money through rates.   \"It is wrong and irresponsible of the utilities to pocket and withhold the   money designed to compensate the QFs,\" Davis said. \"It's immoral and has to   stop.\"   Alternative producers -- ranging from massive co-generation facilities at oil   refineries to tiny biomass plants -- produce about a third of the state's   supply of electricity. But many are shutting down because utilities have not   paid them since November.   The loss of some 3,000 megawatts from tapped-out alternative energy producers   contributed to the blackouts that snarled California yesterday and Monday,   according to the Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power   grid.   The PUC's proposed order -- which will be considered at the board's Tuesday   meeting -- offers the generators a choice of agreeing to a five-year contract   at $79 per megawatt or a 10-year deal at $69 per megawatt, Davis said.   The order does not address the more than $1 billion already owed to the more   than 600 alternative energy producers around the state. Davis said to favor   one creditor over another in past debt could bring on bankruptcy proceedings   from other creditors.   The Legislature would also need to act to make the order work.   \"It is critical to keep these facilities up and online,\" said Sen. Debra   Bowen, D-Marina del Ray, who estimates that Edison has $1.5 billion in cash   on hand, and PG&E $2.5 billion. \"The utilities owe it to the people of the   state to pay them.\"   Edison said yesterday that it opposed any attempt to place alternative   producers ahead of their other creditors.   But Tom Higgins, a senior vice president for Edison International, which owes   alternative producers some $835 million, said his company was talking to the   governor's office about possible payment structures.   Alternative energy producers, particularly those that use high-priced natural   gas to fire their generators, say that without an immediate infusion of cash   they must close their plants.   \"We've been obsessed with the health of the utilities and (have) forgotten   the health of everyone else,\" said V. John White, legislative director of the   Clean Power Campaign, which lobbies for alternative energy producers.   CalEnergy Operating Corp., which operates eight geothermal plants in the   Imperial Valley producing 268 megawatt hours for Edison has sued the utility   asking to be paid and to be temporarily released from their contract with   Edison which has paid them nothing since November.   CalEnergy has a court hearing tomorrow on its Edison contract. Edison owes   the company $75 million, and the debt increases by $1 million a day.   \"We've lived up to our end of the bargain but Edison hasn't. We're now not in   a position to make a property tax payment on April 10 and we're the largest   employer in the county,\" said Vince Signorotti, CalEnergy's property manager.   Unlike Edison, PG&E is paying its creditors 15 cents on the dollar.   \"We have offered over the past five days to prepay for future power not yet   delivered to keep as many of them operating as possible, but the state needs   to decide how its going to divvy up the limited money under the frozen   rates,\" said John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman.   The PUC's sudden attempt to recast the rates paid to alternative generators   comes after several months of inaction, partly a result of waiting for   legislative negotiations on the issue to conclude. Those negotiations   eventually failed to move forward.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -------------------------------------  State claims $5.5 billion overcharge: Refunds by wholesale generators sought  By Dale Kasler  Bee Staff Writer  (Published March 22, 2001)   In its boldest attempt yet to extract refunds from wholesale power   generators, the state's grid operator accused the generators Wednesday of   overcharging Californians by $5.5 billion for electricity since last May.   The state's Independent System Operator, which manages the state's   transmission grid, plans to tell a federal regulatory agency today that power   generators consistently took advantage of their stranglehold on the   California market to ratchet up prices.   The federal agency, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, recently   threatened to order generators to refund $134.8 million for overcharges,   mostly covering January and February. But those refunds amounted to just a   fraction of what the grid operator was seeking. The ISO, which has been   complaining about market abuses for several months, says FERC must do more.   \"We're happy that (FERC) took this first step, but we think there's a long   way to go,\" said Anjali Sheffrin, the ISO's director of market analysis. \"As   far as I'm concerned, it's been too little, too late. ... The refunds they   have acted on (so far) have been minimal.\"   She said the report covers five major power suppliers and 16 other power   importers.   FERC Commissioner William L. Massey said it would be improper for him to   comment on a report that has not yet been filed. But when told of the $5.5   billion total, Massey told the Los Angeles Times: \"That doesn't shock me in   any way.\"   \"Prices over the past 10 months in California have greatly exceeded the   federal standards of just and reasonable prices, and I think they have   exceeded the standards by possibly billions of dollars,\" he said.   However, most FERC critics are skeptical that the federal agency, which is a   strong believer in letting free markets run their course, would order a   refund anywhere near as large as $5.5 billion -- even though it has found   that California prices at times have been \"unjust and unreasonable.\"   The big power generators, saying their charges were reasonable, are disputing   the $134.8 million refunds proposed so far and have vowed to fight the ISO's   latest effort.   If the ISO were to prevail, the $5.5 billion in refunds could go a long way   toward remedying California's energy mess.   They could help restore the financial health of Pacific Gas and Electric Co.   and Southern California Edison, which have nearly been bankrupted by the   prices charged by the power generators. They also could ease the strain on   the state treasury, which is spending billions to purchase electricity for   Californians because PG&E and Edison can't.   Sheffrin said her department studied sales made by the power generators to   ISO, which makes last-minute power purchases to balance supply with demand,   and the California Power Exchange, the now-bankrupt entity where most of   California's wholesale electricity was bought and sold until December.   She said the study made \"very generous\" allowances for natural gas expenses,   costly air-pollution credits and other factors, including the scarcity of   electricity. The result was $5.5 billion worth of charges \"in excess of   competitive costs,\" she said.   In many cases, the companies used their market clout to submit bids that were   \"way beyond their costs,\" she said.   \"It was insufficient competition,\" Sheffrin said. \"They got away with a lot.\"   She said the refund request isn't just a shot in the dark. FERC, she noted,   \"has already found that prices in the California wholesale energy market have   been unreasonable. We took it upon ourselves ... to show FERC how they got to   be so high.\"   FERC proposed refunds totaling $124 million for January and February sales,   declaring that generators' prices were too high.   In a separate case the federal agency, for the first time, accused two   generators last week of taking plants offline to force prices up.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------    Power solution eludes Davis: Lawmakers grow edgy as crisis drags on   By Emily Bazar and Amy Chance  Bee Capitol Bureau  (Published March 22, 2001)   Gov. Gray Davis likes to compare the state's energy crisis to a complicated   \"three-cornered\" billiard shot.   But as California plunged into another round of power blackouts this week,   Davis has yet to line up the angle on an ultimate solution.   The state's short-term power bill is nearing $4.2 billion, and legislators   are balking at the administration's requests for additional money.   Getting even the least controversial pieces of the puzzle through the   Legislature is taking weeks longer than expected.   While the Democratic governor has insisted secrecy about details of his power   purchases is necessary to protect the state's bargaining position, other   state officials are complaining vigorously about the lack of information.   And critical deals the governor hoped to reach with energy suppliers and   utility companies are proving difficult to close.   \"I think we all got lulled into a little complacency a few weeks ago. All   these things seemed to be going along, and the governor was making all these   warm and fuzzy comments,\" said Assemblyman John Campbell, R-Irvine.   \"But it only takes one deal to go sideways and we're all blacked out,\" he   added. \"The governor is running around basically saying, 'Trust me.' I'm not   sure he's deserving of the trust at this point.\"   Davis and his aides insist they are working around the clock on plans to   boost power generation, encourage conservation and reach an agreement with   utilities that will keep them out of bankruptcy.   The utility plan, they say, is the equivalent of a large corporate merger   that simply can't be accomplished overnight. Davis notes that earlier   deregulation efforts might have benefitted from a little more time.   Although the state has reached a broad \"agreement in principle\" with Southern   California Edison to obtain its power transmission lines in exchange for help   paying off its debts, a final, detailed deal has not been reached. The   initial agreement with Edison was announced Feb. 23.   And the governor has yet to achieve a tentative agreement with Pacific Gas   and Electric Co., which is driving a harder bargain over price and other   elements of a potential rescue plan.   Joseph Fichera, one of several consultants receiving more than $11 million   from the administration for advice on the energy crisis, said many people   don't realize the complexity of the deal they're brokering.   In their bid to achieve a public takeover of the investor-owned utilities'   transmission lines, he said, negotiators have to pore over thousands of   documents related to the transmission lines alone.   \"We are doing what is normal in a transaction of this magnitude, which is   investigate, document, circulate, redocument, agree, move forward,\" said   Fichera, an investment banker with Saber Partners in New York City. \"The   governor has put a 'I want this yesterday' fire\" under his negotiating team.   The negotiator, however, declined to say when he expects final agreements to   be reached with the companies.   \"It could be days, it could be weeks,\" he said.   There were signs, meanwhile, of trouble brewing on another front: the giant   bond sale the state must make to repay the money it has spent so far on   electricity and to finance future long-term contracts for energy.   State Treasurer Phil Angelides said Wednesday the utilities are appealing a   ruling by the state Public Utilities Commission that essentially ensures the   state will be repaid, a move that he said threatens to delay the sale   indefinitely.   \"If the utilities have decided to adopt a scorched earth policy until they   get what they need and want, then it will be a significant problem,\"   Angelides said.   PG&E spokesman Ron Low said the governor is simply placing too many demands   on a rate structure that doesn't compensate the utilities for their current   costs.   \"Political rhetoric is not going to change the math,\" he said.   In the Legislature, lawmakers are growing grumpier. Most were taken by   surprise Monday when blackouts were ordered across the state, weeks before   summer temperatures were expected to set in and strain the power system.   \"I'm more worried than ever,\" said Assemblyman Bill Leonard, R-San   Bernardino. \"A lot of the elements we thought we had a handle on in January   are unraveling.\"   A deal the governor said had been worked out weeks ago between the state and   more than 600 small alternative energy suppliers collapsed last week.   The alternative generators have not been paid by the utilities for months,   and state leaders attempted to bargain down the price utilities pay those   generators for power.   But administration officials complained privately that lawmakers instead   sweetened the pot for the suppliers to the point that the measure no longer   helped solve the overall financial situation pushing the utilities toward   bankruptcy. Under a proposal announced Tuesday by Davis, the Legislature   would authorize the PUC to require the utilities to pay the alternative   suppliers at prices more closely resembling the original deal.   But the governor ran into immediate opposition, as some suppliers said said   he would not pay them enough to cover their fuel costs.   \"We would go from not being paid, to losing money,\" said Hal Dittmer of   Wellhead Electric, a Sacramento-based supplier that has been shut down for   more than a month. \"Almost everybody who burns natural gas is going to shut   down. (Davis) got it wrong.\"   Democrats outside the Davis administration, meanwhile, are complaining about   the amount of money the state Department of Water Resources is spending on   expensive, last-minute power purchases. Within a week, $4.2 billion will have   been committed.   State Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, chairman of the joint Legislative Budget   Committee, is warning the Davis administration that he will block additional   funds for last-minute purchases of power until the PUC makes progress   recovering money that already has been spent. He intends to hold a hearing on   the issue this morning.   On Wednesday, state Controller Kathleen Connell told Davis she will refuse to   make a routine budget transfer he had requested, saying she is concerned that   there is \"no outside check and balance\" on the money the administration is   spending to buy electricity on the spot market.   As the statewide elected official who pays the state's bills, Connell said   she has yet to receive information from the Department of Water Resources   about how much it is spending.   \"We really need an accounting as to the total amount of liability they have   accumulated,\" she said. \"I understand they're in an emergency situation ...   but it begins to imperil the state's ability to manage its cash flow.\"   Meanwhile, a bill to provide $1 billion for conservation programs, aimed at   reducing power needs this summer, also has languished for several weeks in   the state Senate. While Davis has focused his attention elsewhere, Republican   lawmakers have opposed the measure as too expensive. Democrats argue that   each two-week delay prevents the state from saving as much energy as one   \"peaker\" plant will produce this summer. Peaker plants are designed to help   meet the peaks of electricity demand.   \"I'm the eternal optimist, but we have to keep working on all fronts,\" said   Sen. Byron Sher, D-Palo Alto, who hopes to take his energy conservation bill   up for a vote in the Senate again today. \"It's a formidable challenge.\"   Bee staff writer Dale Kasler contributed to this report.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -------------------------------------------  Legislators learn some details of power contracts  By John Hill  Bee Capitol Bureau  (Published March 22, 2001)   The veil of secrecy surrounding the state's electricity contracts lifted   Wednesday -- a little.   Gov. Gray Davis gave state legislators a report laying out some of the   details of long-term contracts designed to help the state pull out of its   energy crisis. But the report left legislators and others clamoring for more.   \"The information raises more questions,\" said Assemblyman George Runner,   R-Lancaster. \"I liken it to watching a parade through a knothole in a fence.   You get to look at one float, but you're not sure about what's coming up and   what you've missed.\"   Davis had previously disclosed that the state had signed or was close to   signing 40 long-term contracts, at an average price over 10 years of $69 per   megawatt-hour.   The contracts are part of the state's strategy for trying to avoid a fiscal   shellacking in the energy spot market while making sure there's enough   electricity to avoid more blackouts.   Davis also previously disclosed that the contracts were for an average of   about 9,000 megawatts a year, and that the total cost exceeded $40 billion.   But Davis has resisted telling more, saying the state would jeopardize its   ability to get the best prices if electricity generators knew what their   counterparts were getting.   On Wednesday, the governor's office released a March 15 report from S. David   Freeman, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, to   the state Department of Water Resources. The state agency has been given the   responsibility of making power purchases, and Freeman was brought in to lead   the negotiations.   As of March 15, the state had signed 19 contracts with seven suppliers for   periods ranging from 14 months to 20 years, with many for three or five   years, the report says. Some of the contracts are for electricity to meet the   state's everyday power demand, while others are only for times of peak use,   such as hot summer days.   The state had \"agreements in principle\" for an additional 25 contracts.   Runner said he has been told that two of these contracts have since been   finalized.   The amount of power provided reaches a peak in 2004 of more than 10,000   megawatts. As the long-term contracts start to expire around then, the state   is hoping that demand can be met with new contracts or spot purchases at   prices expected to be much cheaper.   The report says nine more long-term contracts were under discussion.   Some of the contracts are with power generators, while others are with   marketers who may get the power from a number of sources.   In some cases, the state may supply the natural gas used to generate the   electricity, or power costs may be pegged to the going rate for the fuel.   Some suppliers can cancel if the state fails to sell bonds by a certain date   to cover power costs or fails to maintain an investment grade credit rating.   Some depend on the construction of power plants, but Freeman said they were   firm commitments.   \"We were pretty careful not to put a hope and a dream in the portfolio,\" he   said.   More contracts will have to be signed to meet summer demand, and these   agreements will probably be more expensive, the report says.   One item not in Freeman's report was a secret deal to relieve several major   generators from having to pay for polluting the air beyond allowable limits.   The long-term power contracts include language that would have the state pay   the costs of \"pollution credits\" that allow power plants to exceed their   permitted levels of smog-forming pollutants, the governor's office confirmed   Wednesday. Spokesman Steve Maviglio said that several generators are being   relieved from having to pay those costs.   V. John White, a Sierra Club lobbyist close to the negotiations, said Dynegy   Inc., which has power plants in El Segundo, Encina and Long Beach, is one of   them. Dynegy officials did not return calls to The Bee on Wednesday.   Freeman said that generators were demanding hefty premiums for having to deal   with air quality regulators in the summer and he figured it would be cheaper   just to pay for the pollution credits.   In other energy-related developments:   With more power plants back online, grid operators dropped down to a Stage 1   electricity alert. The state Independent System Operator was expecting   supplies to gradually increase over the next few days.   The state Public Utilities Commission issued a revised draft decision that   would impose the prices outlined Tuesday by Davis for power produced by   alternative energy companies -- $79 a megawatt-hour for five-year contracts   or $69 a megawatt-hour for 10 years. The proposal is scheduled for a PUC vote   March 27.   A federal judge ruled that one of the nation's major electricity generators   must continue supplying California with emergency power.   In imposing an injunction on Reliant Energy Services Inc., U.S. District   Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. noted the \"rolling blackouts (that have) darkened   the California landscape\" and said the loss of Reliant's production \"poses an   imminent threat.\"   Bee staff writers Carrie Peyton, Chris Bowman and Denny Walsh contributed to   this report.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------      Federal judge orders major power wholesaler to sell to California           By Don Thompson  ASSOCIATED PRESS   March 21, 2001   SACRAMENTO  ) A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction Wednesday   ordering a major electricity wholesaler to continue selling to California   despite its fear that it will not get paid.   U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. said Californians were at risk of   irreparable harm if Reliant Energy Services stopped selling power to the   Independent System Operator, which oversees the state's power grid. The ISO   buys last-minute power on behalf of utilities to fill gaps in supply to try   to fend off blackouts.   Damrell dismissed Reliant's attempt to force the state Department of Water   Resources to back the ISO's purchases for the state's two biggest utilities.   The state has been spending about $50 million a day on power for Pacific Gas   and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, both denied credit by   suppliers after amassing billions of dollars in debts.                   Controller: State's power spending imperils its financial health   Governor says utilities must pay in advance for some power   ?         The judge said he had no authority to force the DWR to pay for that power.   Gov. Gray Davis has said the state isn't responsible for purchasing the   costly last-minute power ISO buys for Edison and PG&E, despite a law   authorizing state power purchases on the utilities' behalf.   ISO attorney Charles Robinson said the ruling gives ISO operators \"a tool to   assist them in keeping the lights on in California.\"   \"Had the decision gone the other way, one could expect other generators to   simply ignore emergency orders,\" Robinson said.   Damrell's preliminary injunction will remain in effect until the Federal   Energy Regulatory Commission rules on the matter.   Damrell denied the ISO's request for preliminary injunctions against three   other wholesalers, Dynegy, AES and Williams, who agreed to continue selling   to the ISO pending the FERC ruling.   The ISO went to court in February after a federal emergency order requiring   the power sales expired. The judge then issued a temporary restraining order,   requiring the sales, but dropped it after the suppliers agreed to continue   sales to California, pending his Wednesday ruling.   The ISO said it would lose about 3,600 megawatts if the suppliers pulled out,   enough power for about 2.7 million households. One megawatt is enough for   roughly 750 homes.   Grid officials said Reliant's share alone is about 3,000 megawatts. Reliant   said the amount at issue actually is less than a fourth of that, because most   of the power is committed under long-term contracts.   Reliant, which provides about 9 percent of the state's power, worries it   won't get paid due to the financial troubles of PG&E and Edison.   PG&E and Edison say that together they have lost about $13 billion since June   due to soaring wholesale electricity costs that California's 1996   deregulation law bars them from passing onto customers.   At the same time, the state has faced a tight electricity supply, due in part   to California power plant shutdowns for maintenance and to a tight   hydroelectric supply in the Pacific Northwest.   Managers of the state power grid imposed rolling blackouts across the state   Monday and Tuesday as supply fell short of demand. Wednesday, cooling   temperatures and the completion of repairs at several power plants allowed   the state to avoid blackouts.   State Controller Kathleen Connell said Wednesday that the energy crunch also   imperils California's financial health.   Connell said the state's power-buying on behalf of Edison and PG&E is is   gutting its budget surplus. Since the state started making emergency power   buys in January, the surplus has fallen from $8.5 billion to about $3.2   billion, she said.   Connell ordered an audit of the state's power-buying, saying Davis is   withholding key financial information from her office and the Legislature.   She is refusing a request by Davis and the Legislature to transfer $5.6   billion into a \"rainy day fund\" she said was set up to impress Wall Street as   the state prepares to issue $10 billion in revenue bonds to cover its   power-buying.   Transferring the money would leave the state general fund $2.4 billion in   debt, Connell said.   Sandy Harrison, spokesman for the state Department of Finance, and Keely   Bosler of the Legislative Analyst's Office, said such transfers are routine   and required by law.   They put the state's budget surplus at $5.6 billion.   \"The law says she has to do it. The law does not give her the power to demand   that kind of audit information,\" Harrison said.   He said the state's budget isn't in danger because it will be repaid with the   $10 billion in long-term debt.   Wells Fargo & Co. chief economist Sung Won Sohn said he sees little progress   in efforts to fix the state's power problems and end state electricity   purchases.   \"If we're going to pour money into a bottomless pit, I would worry about the   state's finances,\" he said. \"At some point we're going to run out of money.\"   The controller's criticism of fellow Democrat Davis won support from Assembly   Republicans and Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican considering   challenging Davis next year.   Jones said he wants to announce his own plan to solve the state's energy   woes, but can't unless Davis releases more financial details.   Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio dismissed the criticism.   \"Political grandstanding doesn't generate one more kilowatt of energy for   California in this time of emergency,\" he said.   Maviglio said the administration has released the financial information it   can without jeopardizing negotiations for long-term power contracts with   wholesalers.     ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------    Controller: State's power spending imperils its financial health         By Don Thompson  ASSOCIATED PRESS   March 21, 2001   SACRAMENTO  ) California's power-buying on behalf of two strapped utilities is   gutting its budget surplus and putting the state at financial risk, the state   controller said Wednesday.   The surplus dropped from $8.5 billion in January, when the state began buying   electricity for Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison,   to $3.2 billion now, Kathleen Connell estimates.   Connell ordered an audit of the state's power-buying, saying Gov. Gray Davis   is withholding key financial information from her office and the Legislature.   Wednesday marked the first time in three days the state avoided rolling   blackouts. Power grid officials credited cooling temperatures and the   completion of repairs at several power plants.   Connell said the energy crunch now imperils the state's budget as well as its   electric grid.   California has been spending about $45 million a day  ) $4.2 billion so far  )   to buy power for Edison and PG&E, both denied credit by electricity   wholesalers.   The two utilities, California's largest, say they are nearly $14 billion in   debt due to soaring wholesale power costs the state's deregulation law blocks   them from recovering from customers.   Meanwhile, the state has faced high natural gas costs and a tight power   supply driven in part by power plant repairs in California and scarce   hydroelectric power in the Pacific Northwest.   Standard & Poor's has put the state on a credit watch due to its power   purchases and chastised Davis, the Legislature and state regulators for not   taking more aggressive steps to assure the utilities can pay their bills.   On Wednesday, Connell said she is refusing a request by Davis and the   Legislature to transfer $5.6 billion into a \"rainy day fund\" she said was set   up to impress Wall Street as the state prepares to issue $10 billion in   revenue bonds to cover its power-buying.   Transferring the money would leave the state general fund $2.4 billion in   debt, Connell said.   Sandy Harrison, spokesman for the state Department of Finance, and Keely   Bosler of the Legislative Analyst's Office, said such transfers are routine   and required by law.   They put the state's budget surplus at $5.6 billion.   \"The law says she has to do it. The law does not give her the power to demand   that kind of audit information,\" Harrison said.   He said the state's budget isn't in danger because it will be repaid with the   $10 billion in long-term debt.   Connell said the scope of the proposed transfer is unprecedented and amounts   to a \"shell game\" that disguises the power purchases' impact on the state   budget.   Wells Fargo & Co. chief economist Sung Won Sohn said he sees little progress   in efforts to fix the state's power problems and end state electricity   purchases.   \"If we're going to pour money into a bottomless pit, I would worry about the   state's finances,\" he said. \"At some point we're going to run out of money.\"   The controller's criticism of fellow Democrat Davis won support from Assembly   Republicans and Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican considering   challenging Davis next year.   Jones said he wants to announce his own plan to solve the state's energy   woes, but can't unless Davis releases more financial details. He said his   plan may involve giving the utilities low-interest loans with their   transmission lines held as collateral.   Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio dismissed the criticism.   \"Political grandstanding doesn't generate one more kilowatt of energy for   California in this time of emergency,\" he said.   Maviglio said the administration has released the financial information it   can without jeopardizing negotiations for long-term power contracts with   wholesalers.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------------    Governor says utilities must pay in advance for some power         By Jennifer Coleman  ASSOCIATED PRESS   March 21, 2001   SACRAMENTO  ) The state's two largest utilities will be ordered to pay   environmentally friendly power generators in advance, a move Gov. Gray Davis   hopes will bring a quick end to the power blackouts that darkened California   this week.   The statewide blackouts that stretched from San Diego to Oregon on Monday and   Tuesday were caused in part by the failure of Southern California Edison and   Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to pay millions of dollars they owe \"qualifying   facilities\" or QFs, Davis said.   Such suppliers use cogeneration  ) steam from manufacturing plus natural gas  )   or solar, wind and other renewable energy to generate electricity. This week   California lost about half the power those generators normally provide.                   Controller: State's power spending imperils its financial health   ?         Several of them said they hadn't been paid by Edison and PG&E in weeks and   can't afford to keep operating their plants.   Davis accused the utilities of taking in money from customers while failing   to pay the QFs. The state has been spending about $45 million a day since   January to buy power for customers of Edison and PG&E, which are so   credit-poor that suppliers refuse to sell to them.   \"It's wrong and irresponsible of the utilities to pocket this money and not   pay the generators,\" the governor said at a Capitol news conference Tuesday   evening. \"They've acted irresponsibly and immorally and it has to stop.\"   PG&E called the governor's statements \"inappropriate and unjustified,\" adding   that it was negotiating a payment plan with the QFs. Edison said it is intent   on paying creditors and working with the California Public Utilities   Commission to pay QFs for future power sales.   Controller Kathleen Connell warned Wednesday that the state's $2   billion-a-month power purchases are jeopardizing California's budget.   The state's budget surplus dropped from $8.5 billion in January, when the   power purchases began, to $3.2 billion now, Connell estimates. She blamed   Davis for withholding key financial information, and ordered an audit of the   state's power spending starting next week.   She blocked a request by the Legislature and Davis administration to transfer   $5.6 billion from the state's general fund into a special \"rainy day\" fund,   saying that would have left the general fund $2.4 billion in debt.   The Legislative Analyst's Office said such transfers are routine; Connell   agreed, but said the size of the transfer is unprecedented.   \"We started this year with a generous budget surplus,\" Connell said. \"The   energy crisis has taken much of that away and this transfer on top of the   electricity purchases would put the fund at risk.\"   Meanwhile, keepers of the state's power grid were optimistic California would   get through Wednesday without another day of rolling blackouts. Two plants   down for repairs returned to service.   Several power plants that were taken down for repairs are also expected come   online by the end of the week, reducing the likelihood of blackouts, said Jim   Detmers, ISO vice president.   Power may flow to homes and businesses, but it could soon cost consumers   more, said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, one of the Legislature's leaders on   energy issues.   \"I think it's intellectually appropriate and honest to tell people as soon as   it's apparent\" that a rate increase is warranted, the Boulder Creek Democrat   said Tuesday, indicating that time had come.   He estimated that the state Public Utilities Commission may soon have to   raise rates by about 15 percent to cover the state's costs and its utilities'   bills.   \"My sense is that people will appreciate having some certainty and being able   to plan for it,\" he said. \"They don't have to like it but I think they'll   appreciate it.\"   Davis said he is confident the utilities and the state can pay their bills   without further rate increases for Edison and PG&E customers.   In the meantime, the Independent System Operator, keeper of the grid, is   counting on continued conservation by residents and businesses to avoid more   blackouts. Conservation accounted for about 300 megawatts in savings during   Tuesday's peak usage, enough to power 300,000 homes.   Roughly a half-million homes and businesses were affected by Tuesday's   blackouts, which snarled traffic and plunged schools and businesses into   darkness across the state.   The outages began at 9:30 a.m. and continued in 90-minute waves until about 2   p.m., when the ISO lifted its blackout order. They were blamed for at least   one serious traffic accident.   Two cars collided at an intersection in the Los Angeles suburb of South El   Monte where the traffic lights were out. Two people were seriously hurt, said   California Highway Patrol Officer Nick Vite.   In San Francisco's Chinatown, souvenir shops normally bustling with visitors   were forced to shut down. Nearby, irritated customers waited for a bank to   reopen.   The blackouts, like Monday's, were caused by a combination of problems,   including unseasonably warm weather, reduced electricity imports from the   Pacific Northwest and numerous power plants being shut down for repairs.   Adding to those troubles, the state lost about 3,100 megawatts from the QF   plants.   Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey, estimated   Tuesday that Edison has amassed more than $1 billion and PG&E more than $2   billion that they have not paid to generators.   Davis said the PUC planned to issue an order next week directing the   utilities to pre-pay their future QF bills.   PG&E said its prepayments hinge on an upcoming PUC decision on whether the   utility's rates are sufficient to pay its bills and cover the state's power   purchases on its behalf, which amount to $4.2 billion since early January.   Edison and PG&E say they have lost more than $13 billion since last June to   climbing wholesale electricity prices, which the state's 1996 deregulation   law prevents them from passing on to ratepayers.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------    Energy Overcharge of $5.5 Billion Is Alleged     Power: Money should be refunded to taxpayers and utilities, the state grid   operator says, citing evidence of market manipulation. Suppliers deny the   accusation.     By TIM REITERMAN and NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, Times Staff Writers     ?????Wholesale electricity suppliers overcharged California by about $5.5   billion between May and last month, and that money should be refunded to the   state's taxpayers and financially strapped utilities, the state power grid   operator said Wednesday.  ?????Generators engaged in market manipulation and consistent patterns of   bidding far above costs in the deregulated energy market, the California   Independent System Operator found in a study of pricing data. The findings   support the widespread belief that these suppliers reaped massive additional   revenue by manipulating the market.  ?????Spokesmen for the companies denied the accusation.  ?????The study, prepared for a filing with federal regulators today, is   central to Cal-ISO's efforts to seek reimbursement for what it considers   excessive charges by electricity suppliers during the state's energy crisis.  ?????\"This might be the first time we told them the total impact and   magnitude [of the overcharging],\" said Anjali Sheffrin, Cal-ISO's director of   market analysis. \"We think the entire amount deserves consideration for   refunds.\"  ?????Using confidential bidding data on tens of thousands of electricity   sales, Cal-ISO found that five companies that together supply about 30% of   the power delivered to customers of the state's investor-owned utilities   engaged in two types of behavior that tended to push up prices:  ?????* They effectively withheld supplies by bidding at excessive prices,   even though they could have made some money selling more electricity.  ?????* Less frequently, they had power generation available but did not bid   at all.  ?????The study concluded that energy suppliers commonly offered their   electricity at twice their cost. For example, Sheffrin said, the average   markup in August was 100% during peak hours.  ?????A spokeswoman at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which   oversees wholesale electricity pricing across the country, declined to   comment Wednesday, saying, \"This is part of an ongoing proceeding.\"  ?????FERC member William L. Massey, who has considered previous commission   actions on refunds to be inadequate, said it would be improper for him to   comment on a report that has not yet been filed. But when told of the   $5.5-billion total, Massey said: \"That doesn't shock me in any way.\"  ?????\"Prices over the past 10 months in California have greatly exceeded the   federal standards of just and reasonable prices, and I think they have   exceeded the standards by possibly billions of dollars,\" he said.  ?????Cal-ISO, which oversees grid operations and an emergency energy market,   previously detailed $550 million in alleged overcharges for December and   January and asked FERC for refunds. But the commission has proposed refunds   of only a tiny fraction of that amount.  ?????The study covered five major in-state power suppliers--Reliant Energy,   Dynegy, Williams/AES, Duke Energy and Mirant, formerly Southern Energy--plus   16 power importers, all of which deliver power to customers of Pacific Gas &   Electric Co., Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric Co.  ?????\"All [21] overcharged, but some excessively and some by moderate   amounts,\" Sheffrin said.  ?????Cal-ISO's public filing will quantify the alleged overcharging by each   company, but the companies will be identified only by a number. The code will   be provided to FERC, Sheffrin said, and Cal-ISO lawyers will determine how   much information about the companies will be made public.    ?????State, U.S. Investigations  ?????California electricity markets and the companies that buy and sell power   in the state have been the subject of several investigations by state and   federal authorities since wholesale electricity prices first skyrocketed in   May.  ?????Electricity suppliers have repeatedly denied manipulating the California   market in any way, whether through above-cost bidding in spot markets or   through physical withholding of electricity to drive up prices.  ?????Reliant Energy is cooperating with FERC's requests for more data and is   confident the commission will conclude that prices charged by Reliant were   justified, said Joe Bob Perkins, president of the Houston-based company.  ?????Perkins also bitterly disputed charges that Reliant has shut down units   so that it can earn bigger profits on the power sold by the remaining plants.   These charges have been leveled against all of the power-plant owners in the   state.  ?????Reliant Vice President John Stout said Cal-ISO's calculations typically   don't include such fixed costs as salaries, taxes and the interest on bonds   they sold to finance their power plants, which they acquired under terms of   the state's landmark 1996 deregulation law.  ?????In addition, he said, many high-priced power days have resulted from   buyers bidding against each other for scarce supplies rather than sellers   charging excessive amounts--like a house price being driven far above the   listing price in a hot real estate market.  ?????Williams Energy Services, a trading company that markets most of the   power produced by plants owned by AES, also says it will be exonerated by   FERC once the commission examines documentation being submitted, said Paula   Hill-Collins, spokeswoman for the Tulsa, Okla., company.  ?????\"FERC has the obligation to investigate when these accusations are   made,\" Hill-Collins said. \"This is just a process of justification, not   necessarily proof of guilt.\"  ?????Williams/AES was recently ordered by FERC to prove that it did not take   generating units out of service last year to drive up electricity prices, or   refund $10.8 million to California utilities.  ?????During the period studied, suppliers sold electricity in the California   Power Exchange to Southern California Edison, PG&E and San Diego Gas &   Electric Co. and in a backup market for last-minute electricity operated by   Cal-ISO. But sky-high prices plunged Edison and PG&E deeply into debt, and   most suppliers stopped selling to them in January, forcing the state   Department of Water Resources to step in as the primary electricity buyer for   the three big utilities' 27 million customers.  ?????The Cal-ISO study, first summarized at an energy conference last week at   UC Berkeley but not otherwise publicized, concluded that the companies   exercised so-called market power to pump up electricity prices.  ?????Severin Borenstein, director of the Energy Institute at Berkeley, said   Cal-ISO's study is consistent with his research examining pricing practices   in 2000.  ?????\"We found several billion dollars . . . in departures from competitive   pricing,\" he said. \"When the market was tight this summer, they were able to   push up prices, and they did.\"  ?????The early warning signs of electricity price spikes, the study found,   appeared in May after two years of relatively stable prices of $30 to $40 per   megawatt-hour under deregulation. Prices went up during the summer, dipped in   September and October with lower demand, then took off in November and   December as weather turned cold and the price of natural gas, which is used   to generate much of the state's electricity, reached record levels.  ?????\"There were plant outages, and demand and supply became close,\" Sheffrin   said. \"Whatever price they bid had to be taken, and market power asserted   itself.\"  ?????Cal-ISO found that $3 billion of the alleged overcharges occurred   between May and November.  ?????On Friday, federal regulators ordered six wholesale power suppliers to   refund $55 million to California if they cannot justify prices charged in   February. The refund was limited to power sold that month in excess of $430   per megawatt-hour during Stage 3 power alerts, when supplies are so tight   that rolling blackouts are threatened. (One megawatt-hour is enough   electricity to supply 750 typical homes for an hour.)  ?????The previous week, FERC ordered 13 suppliers to justify or refund $69   million for power sold in January at prices above $273 per megawatt-hour.  ?????Massey opposed the potential refunds as too low because they were   limited to hours in which a Stage 3 power emergency was in place and because   the benchmark price set for each month was too high--combining to exempt more   than 70,000 transactions from scrutiny.  ?????\"We're still looking for our lost wallet under the lamppost, which is   Stage 3 alerts,\" said Massey, one of three commissioners on the five-member   board (two seats are vacant).  ?????Generators \"have been given the free and clear,\" he said.  ?????\"These tinkling little refunds they have come out with recently are   almost a joke,\" said Cal-ISO board member Mike Florio, senior attorney at the   Utility Reform Network.    ?????Resisting Price Caps  ?????Cal-ISO contends that the last 10 months have proved that generators can   no longer be allowed to receive electricity prices that are dictated by what   the market will bear.  ?????\"FERC granted market-based rate authority on each of these suppliers'   own showing that they could not manipulate prices, yet their actions have   shown the contrary,\" Sheffrin said. \"We feel FERC needs to look at the   premise of allowing these generators to continue selling at market-based   rates.\"  ?????The commission is responsible for ensuring just and reasonable   electricity rates. Although it has called California's power market   dysfunctional and vulnerable to manipulation, the agency has resisted setting   firm price caps sought by California's congressional delegation.  ?????Chairman Curt L. Hebert Jr. strongly opposes caps, while Massey wants to   use caps across the West as a \"temporary timeout.\"  ?????Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, in a New York news conference   Wednesday, reiterated his opposition to electricity price caps as a way to   cope with California's energy crisis.  ?????\"If we put price caps in place, there will be more blackouts, and   they'll be worse,\" Abraham said.  ?????Cal-ISO is filing its market study as part of its comments on FERC staff   recommendations on ways to thwart market manipulation. FERC's proposal   includes strict coordination of power plant outages by Cal-ISO with reporting   of suspicious closures to FERC, and generator-by-generator bid caps tied to   costs.  ---   ?????Reiterman reported from San Francisco, Rivera Brooks from Los Angeles.

By DAN MORAIN and JENIFER WARREN, Times Staff Writers     ?????SACRAMENTO--California's fragile electricity system stabilized   Wednesday, but a Davis administration report suggested troubles ahead because   the state could be forced to buy most of its power for the coming summer on   the costly and volatile spot market.  ?????After two days of statewide blackouts, power plants that had been shut   down were cranked up. Unseasonable heat tapered off. The operators of the   statewide power grid relaxed their state of emergency.  ?????But plenty of ominous signs remained. Many small producers remained shut   down, skeptical about Gov. Gray Davis' plan for utilities to pay them.  ?????State Controller Kathleen Connell issued a sharp warning about the high   cost of the state's foray into the power business and announced that she will   block an administration request that she transfer $5.6 billion into an   account that could be tapped to pay for state purchases of electricity.  ?????And a report from the administration summarizing contracts between Davis   and independent power generators showed that the state has signed contracts   for only 2,247 megawatts of electricity, significantly less than the 6,000 to   7,000 megawatts previously claimed.  ?????While there are agreements in principle for the full amount, the report   notes that generators can back out of the contracts for a variety of reasons,   including the state's failure to sell bonds to finance power purchased by   July 1. The Legislature has approved plans to sell $10 billion in bonds, but   none have yet been issued.  ?????\"We are exposed enormously this summer,\" Senate Energy Committee   chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) said after looking at the report.   \"We owe the people the truth about how difficult this summer is going to be.   We don't have a power fairy.\"  ?????Perhaps most significant, the report suggests that the contracts fall   significantly short of Davis' stated goal of buying no more than 5% of the   state's summer needs on the spot electricity market, where prices can be many   times those of long-term contracts.  ?????After reading the report, Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist   who studies the California electricity market, said the numbers suggested   that the state's long-term contracts will cover less than half of what the   state will need this summer.  ?????\"We're definitely short this summer, next summer and the summer of   2003,\" he said.  ?????California was forced to start buying electricity in December--at a cost   of $50 million a day--because producers refused to sell to Southern   California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric. The two utilities amassed   billions of dollars in debt when prices for wholesale power soared on the   spot market.  ?????Vikram Budhraja, a consultant retained by Davis to negotiate deals with   generators, said the report represents a \"work in progress.\" He said the   state may yet sign new contracts.  ?????However, Wolak said the contract figures confirm what he and others have   been dreading: that summer is going to be rife with rolling blackouts unless   serious steps to cut demand are taken immediately.  ?????Wolak and other experts say large industrial customers must be switched   to real-time meters and pricing to persuade them to use the bulk of their   energy at times of low demand.  ?????The head of the Energy Foundation, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that   promotes sustainable sources of power, made the same proposal to Davis on   Wednesday.  ?????\"The government need not ask customers to swelter in the dark this   summer,\" foundation President Hal Harvey argued in a letter.  ?????He also proposed a crash campaign to boost sales of efficient appliances   and lightbulbs. He said the state needs to take over the utilities' contracts   with alternative energy providers to ensure they stay in business, and sign   new contracts for 1,500 megawatts of new wind power--the cheapest, fastest   and cleanest source of new supply.  ?????Davis had proposed a formula Tuesday to force private utilities to pay   the alternative producers, some of which have not been paid since November.   But some of them warned Wednesday that Davis' plan offers them little   incentive to turn on their generators.  ?????Alternative energy producers supply more than a quarter of the   electricity consumed in California.  ?????Many producers generate electricity from wind, sun and geothermal   sources. But most of them generate power using natural gas--and the cost of   natural gas has been soaring. Several natural gas users said Davis' plan,   which caps rates, won't cover their fuel costs.  ?????Davis assumes that the price of natural gas will fall. But small   generators say they don't have sufficient purchasing power or sophistication   to gamble on future prices.  ?????The Public Utilities Commission is expected to approve Davis' proposal   next week. It offers producers two choices: 7.9 cents a kilowatt-hour if they   agree to supply power for five years, or 6.9 cents a kilowatt-hour over 10   years.  ?????\"The price of natural gas is higher than that,\" said Marty Quinn,   executive vice president and chief operating officer of Ridgewood Power LLC,   which owns three natural gas-fired co-generation plants. \"If we operate,   we'll lose money.\"  ?????Ridgewood is not operating, having been cut off by gas suppliers. The   company sued PG&E last month seeking overdue payments and release from its   contracts with the utility.  ?????A hearing is scheduled in El Centro today in another lawsuit filed by a   small energy producer, an Imperial Valley geothermal producer that sued   Edison for refusing to let it break its contract and sell on the open market.   CalEnergy says Edison owes it about $140 million for energy sold since   November.  ?????A company spokesman, Jay Lawrence, said CalEnergy was going ahead with   its suit despite Davis' proposal. \"We've had promises before,\" he said.  ?????In other developments:  ?????* A federal judge in Sacramento on Wednesday ordered Reliant Energy of   Houston, a major producer, to continue selling power to California during   emergencies, despite the company's argument that it may not be fully   reimbursed. The order will remain in effect for 60 days or until the U.S.   Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decides a related case.  ?????* Connell said the state budget surplus has shrunk to $3.2 billion   because the state has spent roughly $2.8 billion on electricity. She   criticized the administration for withholding basic information about state   finances, and said she will begin an audit on Monday of the Department of   Water Resources, which is responsible for purchasing power.  ?????Davis' aides said Connell took her action because the Democratic   governor endorsed one of Connell's foes this week in the race for Los Angeles   mayor, former Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa. A Connell aide scoffed   at the notion.  ?????* Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said she \"never has had a response\"   from President Bush after writing him last month for an appointment to   discuss the California energy crisis.  ?????In a wide-ranging lunch talk with reporters in Washington, she deplored   the fact that \"huge, huge profits are being made\" in the California crisis,   and said \"an appropriate federal role\" would be to guarantee a reliable   source of power until the state can get nine new generators online.  ---   ?????Times staff writers Mitchell Landsberg in Los Angeles and Robert L.   Jackson in Washington contributed to this report.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------  Net Complex A Dilemma For San Jose   SERVER FARM: Plant would tax grid   David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer  Thursday, March 22, 2001   ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle   URL:   http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/03/22/M  N236772.DTL   San Jose, while trying to block construction of a new power plant, is set to   approve a vast computer complex that could overwhelm California's already   strained power grid.   City officials gave preliminary approval last week to what would be the   world's largest \"server farm.\" The sprawling facility to handle Internet   traffic would drain about 150 megawatts of power from the state electricity   grid.   If granted final authorization on April 3, the $1.2 billion project would add   the equivalent of about 150,000 homes to California's power system, which was   hit this week by rolling blackouts as demand for juice outstripped available   supply.   The server-farm issue highlights a vexing dilemma for the state.   On the one hand, Gov. Gray Davis is calling for widespread conservation to   help California overcome its current troubles. On the other, no one wants to   curtail growth of the high-tech industry, which is an engine for economic   vitality.   \"San Jose will make a lot of money from this project,\" said Craig Breon,   executive director of the Santa Clara Valley Audubon Society. \"But to not   help the state out of its energy situation, there's a fair amount of   hypocrisy going on.\"   The server farm would be owned by U.S. DataPort, a San Jose data-management   firm. As planned, it would occupy 10 buildings on more than 170 acres in the   city's Alviso area.   Total projected energy use would be 180 megawatts. About 30 megawatts would   be generated by a small on-site facility, and the rest would have to be   provided by Pacific Gas and Electric Co.   \"We're confident that the DataPort project will be approved because it's very   important to San Jose and to the local economy,\" said San Jose Mayor Ron   Gonzales.   But PG&E already is saying that its power cupboard is bare. The utility \"does   not have sufficient existing electric infrastructure\" to meet U.S. DataPort's   needs, it said in a recent letter to San Jose officials.   John Mogannam, U.S. DataPort's senior vice president of operations, countered   that it could take as long as five years for the server farm to grow big   enough to require the full 150 megawatts from the state grid.   \"Hopefully, by then the whole energy crisis will pass by, and we won't have a   problem,\" he said.   Mogannam stressed the positive aspects of the project, such as its ability to   handle about 15 percent of global Internet traffic, the 700 jobs it would   create, and the $70 million over 10 years it would generate for San Jose in   property and utility taxes.   \"That's why the city likes it,\" he said.   Indeed, San Jose officials are so enamored with such developments that they   have all but turned a deaf ear to warnings that the server farm will   exacerbate California's already dire power shortage.   Andrew Crabtree, the city's senior planner, said the planning commission had   barely touched the question of energy supply when it approved the server farm   last week.   \"It wasn't incumbent on the commission to solve the state's energy-supply   problems,\" he said.   Rather, San Jose city planners focused on the environmental ramifications of   the proposed facility, including air pollution from diesel generators and the   impact on nearby wildlife.   How it would affect dozens of burrowing owls in the area was a key topic of   discussion.   \"We all recognized that there's a power shortage,\" Crabtree said. \"But we   couldn't do anything about that with this project.\"   Except to make things tougher, of course.   Server farms run 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They are an aspect of the   high-tech boom that was never foreseen by energy experts, and which are now a   major contributor to California's surging electricity demand.   A server farm essentially is a large building filled with computers. Each   computer handles the Web site or Internet traffic for hundreds of corporate   clients that do not have the technical resources to look after such things   in- house.   Most server farms consume between 10 and 60 megawatts of power. At 180   megawatts, the U.S. DataPort facility is billed as the most extensive data   center on the planet.   \"There won't be another this size anywhere in the world,\" said Mogannam, the   company's senior vice president. \"This will be the biggest.\"   With such a vast scale, however, comes additional concerns. For example, all   that hardware will generate huge amounts of heat, requiring powerful air   conditioners running around the clock to keep things cool.   Patrick Dorinson, a spokesman for the Independent System Operator, which   oversees California's electricity network, said server farms had \"a big   impact\" on the state's tight energy supply.   \"We have an economy that's increasingly based on delivery of information,\" he   observed. \"We certainly need to make sure we're building adequate generation   and transmission to get it there.\"   As it stands, no major power plants have been built in California for the   past 12 years, while dozens of server farms have sprung up throughout the   state.   The Yankee Group, a Boston consulting firm, estimates that the amount of   space taken up by server farms nationwide rose to 9 million square feet from   1999 to 2000.   By 2003, it expects that figure to increase to 25 million square feet, or   enough room for more than a hundred 10-story office buildings.   San Francisco may be the exception. Supervisor Sophie Maxwell proposed   interim zoning controls last week that would require server farms to receive   special permission from City Hall to operate.   San Jose, for its part, has no such reservations. It does, however, draw the   line at big, fat power plants in the backyard of the city's leading corporate   citizen.   Gonzales is spearheading opposition to a proposed 600-megawatt generating   facility in Coyote Valley because of its proximity to a residential area at   the site of a planned Cisco Systems office complex.   \"There's plenty of opportunities to generate power in the city,\" he said.   \"This project is just in the wrong site.\"   The matter is now in the hands of the California Energy Commission, which is   expected to issue a ruling by May.   Cisco, critics say, twisted the mayor's arm to fight the plant because it did   not want a generating facility in its neighborhood. The area will be home to   thousands of well-heeled tech workers.   \"It's politics,\" said Breon at the Audubon Society. \"City officials are   making political decisions rather than good planning decisions.\"   Ted Smith, executive director of the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition, a   grassroots organization, is calling for a moratorium on construction of all   new server farms in the South Bay until sufficient power can be found to keep   them running.   \"Until they figure out how to build these things without draining the   electricity grid even dryer it is, they shouldn't build them,\" he said.   \"The Internet industry is creating unintended consequences that will really   screw up our future,\" Smith added. \"They are so busy focusing on next   quarter's profits that they don't stop and think about the consequences.\" .   .

The information suggests that California might have to scrounge for   electricity on the high-priced spot market for a couple more years even as it   continues to push conservation efforts and construction of more generating   plants.   Details of the agreements released by Gov. Gray Davis' administration show   that the contracts will provide for just over a third of the state's demand   for power this year. Energy secured by the contracts will grow to meet the   expected demand in three years.   Short-term purchases of power have at least temporarily depleted the state's   budget surplus and have raised the possibility of sharp rate increases   sometime in the future for electricity customers.   Davis administration officials are banking on the hope that conservation   efforts and increased generating capacity will cover the shortfall along with   purchases of electricity on the spot market.   \"We're facing an extreme challenge still this summer,\" said Severin   Borenstein, head of the University of California at Berkeley Energy   Institute. \"Signing contracts doesn't create more electricity.\"   The information released did not include the names of companies that the   state has signed contracts with or the purchase prices.   The sketchy details did not satisfy frustrated lawmakers, who said many   questions remain, especially how much the state will end up paying under the   terms of the contracts.   \"The fundamental question is how much is it costing the state of California   to keep the lights on,\" said Assemblyman Tony Strickland, R-Thousand Oaks.   \"What we really need is total disclosure.\"   The state started buying power in January, after generators began refusing to   provide electricity to the state's investor-owned utilities. Pacific Gas and   Electric Co. and Southern California Edison say they have more than $13   billion in past debt.   The state has been spending $49 million a day on power purchases since Jan.   17, according to documents obtained by The Chronicle last week.   Those documents said the average price of the contracts across 10 years is   $69 per megawatt hour, including summer peak. The five-year average price is   $79 per megawatt hour.   According to one chart provided by the governor's office yesterday, the   long-term contracts will fall about 35 million megawatt hours short in 2002.   Based on the average price per megawatt hour the state has been paying since   January, that could end up costing between $6.6 billion and $13 billion.   The law creating the state purchasing authority allowed purchases up to $10   billion and extends until 2003.   The governor's office said 21 contracts have been signed and another 23   agreements that have been reached but not yet signed.   Several generators have said that they will not sign contracts with the state   until the back debt by the utilities has been taken care of.   \"We have some real potential problems,\" said Senate President Pro Tem John   Burton, D-San Francisco.   Strickland and several media outlets, including The Chronicle, have filed   public information requests to get more information about the prices of the   contracts from the administration.   Releasing the information would jeopardize the negotiations for future   contracts, said Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman.   Lawmakers, also frustrated by the lack of information given out by the Davis   administration, were not given notice that the information was coming, and   many said it was lost in their mail pile.   The cover letter was on Los Angeles Department of Water and Power letterhead,   not that of the administration. The letter was written by S. David Freeman,   head of the Los Angeles system who was on leave for the month of February to   help the state negotiate the contracts.   Assemblyman George Runner, R-Lancaster, said the \"ambiguity of the   information raises more questions than it answers.\"   \"It's like watching a parade through a peephole,\" he said. \"He's showing us   another float, but I don't know what the parade looks like.\"   Blaming the state's purchases of electricity, Controller Kathleen Connell   said yesterday that the state's cash on hand had fallen from $8.5 billion in   January to $3.2 billion. Connell ordered an audit of the state's power   buying.   Connell said she would block a transfer sought by the Davis administration of   $5.6 billion from the general fund to the state's emergency reserve account,   claiming it would lead to a ''serious cash flow crisis.\"   The transfer, however, is not related to the energy crisis. The sum   represents a routine rollover of unspent money from the previous fiscal year.   State law requires that money to be sent to a special reserve account for   emergencies.   Davis officials acknowledged that $3.7 billion in energy purchases have had   an impact on state coffers, but they say the state will be repaid once bonds   are issued in the coming weeks. They also said the state typically has its   lowest cash reserves at this time of year. That changes in mid-April when a   flood of income tax revenue pours in.   \"The transfer has nothing to do with energy purchases,\" said Sandy Harrison,   a spokesman for the Department of Finance.   \"It's not helpful to ratepayers, taxpayers and people who want their lights   to stay on to have the issue muddied with this sort of inaccurate innuendo,\"   Harrison said.   In other developments yesterday:   -- After two days of statewide rolling blackouts, power grid managers avoided   outages. Demand was lower because of cooler temperatures around the state and   supply increased as several power plants completed repairs.   -- A federal judge in Sacramento ordered a major power generator to continue   supplying power to California. Reliant Energy Services Inc. had insisted that   it should not be forced to sell to debt-heavy utilities unless the state   guaranteed the bills.

(AP) -- Electricity wholesalers overcharged California   $5.5 billion over the past 10 months, according to a report by managers of   the state's power grid.   The five companies, among other things, frequently offered electricity at   prices double what it cost them to produce, concludes the California   Independent System Operator study, which was published Thursday in the Los   Angeles Times.   ``All overcharged, but some excessively and some by moderate amounts,'' said   Anjali Sheffrin, the ISO's director of market analysis.   The Times said the ISO planned to file the study with federal regulators   Thursday and are demanding that the money be paid back.   The companies denied the allegations, adding they expect the Federal Energy   Regulatory Commission will determine their prices were justified.   The commission has recently stepped up its scrutiny of power companies'   behavior during California's power crisis, asking suppliers to justify $124   million in sales during the first two months of the year or refund the money.   Critics claim thousands of additional questionable sales are not being   challenged.   The ISO study alleges the wholesalers manipulated the market by bidding at   excessive prices, effectively withholding supplies, or by not bidding at all   when they had generation capability available.   California has been spending about $45 million a day -- $4.2 billion since   January -- to purchase power for Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern   California Edison. Both utilities, the state's largest, have been cut off by   electricity wholesalers because their credit is almost worthless.   State Controller Kathleen Connell said Wednesday that the state's   power-buying is gutting its budget surplus. Since the state started making   emergency power buys, the surplus has fallen from $8.5 billion to about $3.2   billion, she said.   A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction Wednesday ordering a major   electricity wholesaler, Reliant Energy Services, to continue selling to   California despite its fear that it will not be paid.   U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. said Californians were at risk of   irreparable harm if Reliant stopped selling power to the ISO, which buys it   at the last minute on behalf of utilities to bolster supplies and try to fend   off rolling blackouts.   Such blackouts hit the state twice this week. On Wednesday, cooling   temperatures and the completion of repairs at several power plants allowed   the state to avoid blackouts.   Standard & Poor's has put the state on a credit watch due to its power   purchases and chastised Gov. Gray Davis, the Legislature and state regulators   for not taking more aggressive steps to make sure the utilities can pay their   bills.   Edison and PG&E say they are nearly $14 billion in debt due to soaring   wholesale power costs. The state's deregulation law blocks them from   recovering the costs from customers.   Connell ordered an audit of the state's power-buying, saying Davis is   withholding key financial information from her office and the Legislature.   She said she would refuse to transfer $5.6 billion into a ``rainy day fund''   she said was set up to impress Wall Street as the state prepares to issue $10   billion in revenue bonds to cover its power buys. Transferring the money   would leave the state general fund $2.4 billion in debt, Connell said.   She called the scope of the proposed transfer unprecedented and said it   amounted to a ``shell game'' that disguises the power purchases' effect on   the state budget.   Sandy Harrison, spokesman for the state Department of Finance, and Keely   Bosler, of the Legislative Analyst's Office, said such transfers are routine   and required by law. They put the state's budget surplus at $5.6 billion.   ``The law says she has to do it. The law does not give her the power to   demand that kind of audit information,'' Harrison said.   Harrison said the state's budget isn't in danger because it will be repaid   with the revenue bonds.   Connell's criticism of Davis, a fellow Democrat, won support from Assembly   Republicans and Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who may challenge   Davis next year.   Jones said he wants to announce his own plan to solve the state's energy   woes, but can't unless Davis releases more financial details.   Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio dismissed the criticism.   ``Political grandstanding doesn't generate one more kilowatt of energy for   California in this time of emergency,'' he said.   Maviglio said the administration has released the financial information it   can without jeopardizing negotiations for long-term power contracts with   wholesalers.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------                If the power goes off   Thursday, March 22, 2001   For most of us, rolling power blackouts are a nuisance. For some people, it   could mean life or death.   \"In Laguna Hills, cancer patient Ruben Marquez said the blackout interrupted   and prolonged his dialysis treatment. He was unharmed,\" the Register reported   on Monday's blackouts, which hit about 1.2 million Californians, including   100,000 Orange County homes and businesses.   What can people do to prevent disaster?   \"They and their families should have a backup plan,\" Rebecca Long,   spokesperson for the Orange County Red Cross, told us.   \"The Red Cross recommends in general that you plan for this as you would for   any disaster, making sure you have battery-operated radios and flashlights.   We do not recommend candles for an emergency,\" because of the fire hazard.   She recommended a Web site: www.prepare.org  People with special health needs, such as electric-powered respirators and   oxygen machines, also should register with the power company.  \"There's a whole classification\" for such persons with health needs, Southern   California Edison spokesperson Clara Potes-Fellow told us.  \"The list is for us to alert them that the power could be discontinued. They   arrange to have power through other means, batteries or generators. We   recommend that they have a battery backup of eight hours. Therefore, if the   rotating outages are one hour, they will have plenty.\"  Even though the power company has such people's names, she said, \"we don't   inform them in advance because we have just minutes from when the Independent   System Operator,\" which directs where the electrons go, orders Edison to   implement a power outage on the grid Edison owns. \"By the time it took to   call people, the outage would be over.\"  What's the problem at the ISO? \"We notify as best we can,\" Pat Dorinson, ISO   director of communications, told us.   \"The object is to keep the lights on. Sometimes it's just a moment's notice\"   before a blackout. \"It makes [giving more notice] pretty difficult. We're   looking into ways to make the system better.\"   In the meantime, citizens will have to keep taking precautions.  We can't help noting that free market pricing, instead of politically-driven   prices, would much more likely make electricity available, albeit at higher   prices.   We would expect, too, there would be hardship allowances, donations and   level-pay plans to accommodate various types of needs.          ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -------------------------------------------------------------            Socialized electricity   Thursday, March 22, 2001   Government control of state power won't add one watt for consumers' use          TOM MCCLINTOCK  Sen. McClintock, R-Thousand Oaks, represents the 19th state Senate District   in the state Legislature.     In a city where bad ideas never die, Sacramento is once again host to a   variety of plans for the government takeover of California's power system.   The private sector, it is said, has done such a terrible job of providing   electricity that government must now step in to save the day. Thus, the   Legislature is awash in proposals to spend billions of dollars of public   money to acquire existing power facilities. Fifteen billion dollars has   already been authorized for this purpose, and an additional $10 billion is   pending in the Senate.   Meanwhile, Gov. Davis is losing about a $1.5 billion a month day-trading in   the electricity market. The irony is that after the expenditure of as much as   $25 billion for \"public power,'' not a single inch will have been added to   the transmission lines, nor a single watt to the generating capacity of   California.  The root of California's crisis is a catastrophic shortage of electricity. In   a shortage, prices rise or blackouts occur. To reduce prices and avoid   blackouts, the only permanent solution is to increase the supply. Merely   changing the ownership of existing facilities leaves Californians with   exactly the same shortage, only billions of dollars the poorer for it.   Government takeover advocates argue that at least a government power   authority will protect consumers against price gouging and poor management.   Unfortunately, government power authorities don't insulate against price   gouging. The biggest price gouger in this entire crisis has been the Los   Angeles Department of Water and Power, which was generating electricity for   $51 per megawatt hour and selling it back to California ratepayers for as   much as $1,400.   Nor does a government takeover assure better management. Just a few years   ago, the LADWP was buried in $7 billion in debt. The Sacramento Municipal   Utilities District was a managerial laughing stock, having squandered   hundreds of millions of dollars for a nuclear plant it barely used.  \"Say what you will,'' the government takeover advocates reply, \"when push   came to shove, the municipal utility districts of California are in great   shape, while the private utilities are a basket case.'' But one needs to look   at the reason. Ever since the state reorganized the electricity market in   1996, the municipal utility districts were allowed to trade in a free market,   while the private utilities were forced to buy power exclusively in a   Soviet-style power exchange where the highest bid during an hour set all   prices.  The municipal utilities were able to retain their generators. Government   forced the private utilities to sell theirs. The municipal utilities were   able to enter into long-term contracts. Government prevented the private   utilities from doing the same thing. The municipal utilities were able to   negotiate the lowest prices available for power. Government forced the   private utilities to pay the outlandish prices on the government's power   exchange. The municipal utilities were allowed to adjust their rates to   reflect the actual cost of power to consumers. Government forced the private   utilities to sell at astronomical losses.  The final argument is simply an ideological one: that power is just too   important to be left in private hands. Really? Food is a great deal more   important and private hands have kept this nation well fed for centuries.   Picturing the Department of Motor Vehicles running the local supermarket   should sober even the most euphoric of the government takeover advocates.  California's Independent System Operator is predicting a 6,000-megawatt   shortfall this summer. When there is no electricity on the transmission   lines, it really won't matter who owns them. During the hottest hours of the   hottest days of the year, when as many as 6 million homes are without   electricity, it may begin to dawn on most people that socialism doesn't work   any better in California than it did in the Soviet Union.    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -------  NEWS   Bush's Energy Policy Will Backfire, Feinstein Warns / She wants federal price   controls now  Carolyn Lochhead    03/22/2001   The San Francisco Chronicle   FINAL   Page A.3   (Copyright 2001)   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., warned yesterday that when blackouts   intensify in California this summer, the pressure will intensify on the Bush   administration to explain why it rejected price controls on wholesale   electricity.   \"If by this summer California is, as anticipated, facing these blackouts, and   the federal government won't help, I don't think the American people are   going to be very pleased,\" Feinstein told California reporters.   Asked if help means the cost-based price controls Feinstein is pushing, she   said, \"Right now, yes.\"   Feinstein said California Democrats will begin to escalate their criticism of   the administration, predicting that support will build among Western senators   for her legislation to impose price caps on wholesale electricity in exchange   for lifting the rate cap on California consumers.   If it passes, she said, \"the administration is really going to have to face   whether they're going to help or not help.\"   Feinstein said House Democrats from the West Coast also told her they expect   that White House inaction on price caps would help them gain seats in 2002.   But she refused to speculate on the political fallout from the energy crisis   against Democrats in California .   Feinstein characterized Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham's adamant arguments   against price controls as \"recalcitrant,\" saying his statement to a Senate   committee last week \"essentially said California 's on its own.\"   She speculated that because \" California is dominantly Democratic, even   somebody like me that works across party lines is beginning to wonder if this   isn't an unnecessarily barbed stick at California .\"   White House spokesman Ken Lisaius disputed the charge, saying the Bush   administration is doing all it can, but can't control that demand is   outstripping supply.   \"The federal government cannot prevent blackouts, but can only help at the   margins in situations like this,\" Lisaius said. \"The only thing that can   prevent blackouts is reduced demand, increased supply and good weather.\"   Abraham has twice in the last week argued strongly against price controls,   including the cost-based ones Feinstein advocates, saying they could increase   blackouts by discouraging power sales into the Western electricity grid.   He also said many power providers, including the federal Bonneville Power   Administration in the home district of Sen. Gordon Smith, the Oregon   Republican co-sponsoring Feinstein's bill, would be exempt from federal price   caps. Feinstein disputed that, but Smith's office agreed.   Abraham argued that price controls would not work in part because roughly   half the Western electricity market would be exempt, including federal power   marketing authorities such as Bonneville, rural electric cooperatives and   municipal utilities such as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.   On another front, House Republicans omitted from their budget projected   revenues from opening part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and   gas exploration.   A Budget Committee spokeswoman said Chairman Jim Nussle, R-Iowa, determined   that the $1 billion in revenues from the wildlife refuge the Bush   administration included in its budget were not needed and that there was \"no   reason to put in something that controversial, that some of our members don't   even like, when you don't have to.\"   But Rep. Gary Miller, R-Diamond Bar (Los Angeles County) said House   Republicans \"are not backing off at all\" from opening the wildlife refuge to   drilling. \"Our goal is to get it passed in the House,\" he said, saying the   Budget Committee omitted the revenue projections because the drilling has not   yet been approved.

DWR   By Christina Cheddar    03/22/2001   Dow Jones News Service   (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES        (This report was originally published late Wednesday.)        NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) remains in discussions with   the California Department of Water Resources to sign long-term power   contracts.   However, issues regarding the creditworthiness of the agency remain, said Joe   Bob Perkins, president of Reliant's Wholesale Division.   \"We want to be part of the solution,\" Perkins said. At the same time, Reliant   is trying to protect itself from incurring additional unpaid accounts   receivable, he said.   The DWR has been buying power on behalf of California 's financially troubled   utilities. However, Reliant has yet to sign a formal agreement with the   agency because Reliant is concerned it won't be paid.   During a conference call Wednesday, Perkins said he couldn't comment on a   lawsuit between Reliant and the California Independent System Operator   because he didn't know how it was progressing.   Further court action on the case is expected Wednesday.   The lawsuit stems from Reliant's desire not to be required to sell power to   California if the state won't guarantee payment. The Houston energy company   is concerned that it won't be paid for power being bought by the ISO on   behalf of Edison International's (EIX) Southern California Edison unit and   PG&E Corp.'s (PCG) Pacific Gas & Electric Co. unit.   To date, Reliant is owed \"some $370 million\" from unpaid power sales to the   utilities.   Much of Perkins' presentation centered on how the power crisis in California   emerged.   Using data from research firm Cambridge Energy Research Associates, the   company discussed the imbalance between California 's power demand and its   power supply.   Looking ahead to the summer, it isn't a question of whether rolling blackouts   will occur, but \"how many and how severe,\" Perkins said.   Low hydroelectric availability, loss of imported power, warm weather, demand   growth and plant outages could lead to a worst-case scenario in California ,   he said, adding that some estimates predict California could experience 1,100   hours of power outages this summer.   The skyrocketing power prices in the region are a reflection of the power   market's imbalance, he said.   Reliant submitted only \"economically sound\" bids for power, Perkins said. He   expects the company can document why it charged the prices it did as required   by regulators.   \"We have been very rigorous and very disciplined in what we have submitted,\"   Perkins said.   He added that retail customer price increases are one way of sending a signal   to consumers to lower consumption.

(This article was originally published Wednesday)        LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Any order from the California Public Utilities   Commission requiring utilities to pay small, independent generators going   forward must determine how that could be done within the existing rate   structure, a spokesman for Edison International (EIX) utility Southern   California Edison said Wednesday.   The utility was responding to a PUC proposed decision that would require   utilities to pay small generators, called qualifying facilities, $79 a   megawatt hour within 15 days of electricity delivery. The decision will be   voted March 27 by the CPUC.   \"We're still reviewing (the decision) and should have more to say in a day or   two. To the extent that the commission orders us to pay going forward of   course we will. But it needs to address how we will pay the QFs,\" a SoCal   Edison spokesman said.   SoCal Edison and PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric Co. are   struggling under nearly $13 billion in uncollected power costs due to an   inability to pass high wholesale power costs to customers under a rate   freeze.   Gov. Gray Davis Tuesday blasted the utilities for not having paid their QF   bills in full since December. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. has made some   partial payments to QFs, but SoCal Edison has paid nothing. Together, they   owe the QFs about $1 billion, but the order doesn't address that debt.   An Edison executive said, in reaction to the governor's sharp comments, that   the company simply doesn't have the money to pay creditors.   \"The root problem here is there just isn't enough money in the current rate   base to pay our bills,\" said Edison Senior Vice President of Public Affairs   Bob Foster. \"We understand the financial distress (the QFs) face; we are   facing financial distress ourselves.\"   The proposed PUC order would also require the state's investor-owned   utilities to offer the small generators five- and 10-year contracts for power   for $79/MWh and $69/MWh, respectively.   The QFs \"may be able to live with\" the PUC proposal, but the five- and   10-year contract prices may be inadequate if natural gas prices at one of the   California borders are high, said Jan Smutny-Jones, president of the   Independent Energy Producers Association. Natural gas prices into California   are currently higher than anywhere in the country.   But some say the proposed decision may not be enough to prevent the QFs from   filing involuntary bankruptcy proceedings against the utilities for the money   they are still owed.   \"There's still a lot of skepticism. To say our position has changed based on   the CPUC decision or the governor's announcement is not accurate. A lot still   has to happen,\" said Jay Lawrence, a spokesman for a renewable creditors   committee.   -By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872;   jessica.berthold@dowjones.com   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ------  Calif Small Pwr Producers To Shut Plants If Rates Capped  By Jason Leopold    03/22/2001   Dow Jones Energy Service   (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES      (This article was originally published earlier Thursday.)        LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Many of California 's independent power producers   late Wednesday threatened to take their small power plants offline this week   if state lawmakers pass legislation that would cap the rates the generators   charge for electricity they sell directly to the state's three investor-owned   utilities.   At issue is a bill that would repeal a section of the state's Public   Utilities Code, which links the 688 so-called qualifying facilities'   electricity rates to the monthly border price of natural gas.   Lawmakers, however, are poised to pass the legislation.   State regulators are then expected to approve a measure that would   restructure the fluctuating rates the QFs charge PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit   Pacific Gas & Electric , Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California   Edison, and Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric from $170 a   megawatt-hour to $69-$79/MWh, regardless of the price of natural gas.   Whereas each of the 688 QF contracts differed, largely because natural gas   prices are higher in Southern California than Northern California , the state   wants the QFs to sign a general contract with the utilities.   The cogeneration facilities, which produce about 5,400 megawatts of   electricity in the state, said the rates are too low and they won't sign new   supply contracts with the utilities.   \"For $79/MWh, natural gas would have to be $6 per million British thermal   unit at the Southern California border,\" said Tom Lu, executive director of   Carson-based Watson Cogeneration Company, the state's largest QF, generating   340 MW. \"Our current gas price at the border is $12.50.\"   Other gas-fired QFs said the state could face another round of rolling   blackouts if lawmakers and state regulators pass the legislation, which is   expected to be heard on the Senate floor Thursday, and allow it to be   implemented by Public Utilities Commission next week.   Lu, whose company is half-owned by BP Amoco PLC (BP) and is owed $100 million   by SoCal Ed, said the proposals by the PUC and the Legislature \"will only   make things worse.\"   David Fogarty, spokesman for Western States Petroleum Association, whose   members supply California with more than 2,000 MW, said the utilities need to   pay the QFs more than $1 billion for electricity that was already produced.        State Loses 3,000 MW QF Output Due Of Financial Reasons        The QFs represent about one-third, or 9,700 MW, of the state's total power   supply. Roughly 5,400 MW are produced by natural gas-fired facilities. The   rest is generated by wind, solar power and biomass.   About 3,000 MW of gas-fired and renewable QF generation is offline in   California because the power plant owners haven't been paid hundreds of   millions of dollars from cash-strapped utilities SoCal Ed and PG&E for nearly   four months.   Several small power plant owners owed money by SoCal Ed have threatened to   drag the utility into involuntary bankruptcy if the utility continues to   default on payments and fails to agree to supply contracts at higher rates.   The defaults have left many of the renewable and gas-fired QFs unable to   operate their power plants because they can't afford to pay for the natural   gas to run their units. Others continue to produce electricity under their   contracts with the state's utilities but aren't being paid even on a forward   basis.   The California Independent System Operator, keeper of the state's electricity   grid, said the loss of the QF generation was the primary reason rolling   blackouts swept through the state Monday and Tuesday.   Gov. Gray Davis, recognizing the potential disaster if additional QFs took   their units offline, held marathon meetings with key lawmakers Monday and   Tuesday to try and hammer out an agreement that would get the QFs paid on a   forward basis and set rates of $79/MWh and $69/MWh for five and 10 year   contracts. He also said he would direct the PUC to order the utilities to pay   the QFs for power they sell going forward.   \"After next week the QF problem will be behind us,\" Davis said Tuesday. \"We   want to get the QFs paid...the QFs are dropping like flies...and when that   happens the lights go out.\"   But this just makes the problem worse, said Assemblyman Dean Florez,   D-Shafter, a member of the Assembly energy committee.   \"I don't know how we are going to keep the lights on,\" Florez said in an   interview. \"Many of these congenerators are in my district. They said if the   legislation doesn't change they are going offline. This compounds the issue   of rolling blackouts, especially now when we need every megawatt.\"   Davis, who didn't meet with people representing the QFs, said he was handing   the QF issue to the PUC because lawmakers failed to pass legislation that   would have set a five-year price for natural gas and allow the QFs to sign   individual contracts with the utilities. In addition, SOCal Ed opposed the   legislation, saying the rates should be below $50/MWh.   Some renewable power producers said they aren't vehemently opposed to the new   rate structure because it guarantees them a higher rate than what was   originally proposed.              QFs Want Third Party Supply Contracts        John Wood, who represents the SoCal Ed Gas Fired Creditors Committee, one of   a handful of groups that have formed since January to explore options on   getting paid by the utilities, said his group of gas-fired QF creditors want   to be released from their supply contracts and sell to third parties.   \"Under our plan, we would be permitted to sell electricity to third parties   (including the state Department of Water Resources) until a resolution to the   crisis can be accomplished,\" wood said.   Hal Dittmer, president of Sacramento-based Wellhead Electric in Sacramento,   which is owed $8 million by PG&E, has 85 MW of gas-fired generation units   offline.   Under the state's plan, Dittmer said he risks going out of business.   \"I can't buy natural gas for what I would be paid under this decision,\" he   said. \"The state needs to quit kidding themselves that they don't need to   raise electricity rates. All of this is being driven by an artificial   construct that California can avoid raising rates.\"        -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;   jason.leopold@dowjones.com         ",

Marion & Cynthia will assist us in the coverage as well as Jerry Skirtich who sat  with Galen & I on Tuesday to cover the ncessary steps to generate the billing process.  Galen has a \"desk procedure manual\" assembled that spells out in detail the billing process.  I'm working w/Larry Hill to ensure the Capacity Release transactions are fed to the old TSS system (still testing this process.)  I've expressed a great sense of urgency surrounding the invoicing process given the cash flow concerns we're dealing with.  Sheila    -----Original Message----- From:  Dietz, Rick   Sent: Thursday, November 29, 2001 8:54 AM To: Corman, Shelley; Nacey, Sheila Subject: Galen's Status  Galen's heart catheterization yesterday showed two major blockages, one 99% and the other 75%.  The doctors at St. Lukes installed two stints in the artery to repair these blockages.  Galen said his chest is pain free and the tightness is gone.  His incision on his thigh is very sore and he has not yet been allowed to get out of bed to walk.  I spoke to him this morning and he sounded fairly upbeat and said he should be out of the hospital later on today.  He was concerned about whether he would be able to come in to work on Saturday to process reservation billing.   I assured him that Sheila and I had it covered and he did not need to worry about it.    Rick",

		"_body" : "  Donna please check with Shelley and if ok, please send out to all the Gas Logistics group.  Thanks?cvb  There have been a number of questions concerning the Ray Bowen's memo of February 11th regarding approvals for purchases (iPayit) and payments (iBuyit) and approvals for Employee Expense reports.  ETS is trying to change the procedures which were put in place so what I state today could be different tomorrow.  As of February 20, 2002 the following procedures are to be followed for the Gas Logistics community:   All iBuyit items must be approved by Rod Hayslett.  The iBuyit system has been or is in the process of being changed so that Rod has the final approval before orders are placed.  I believe our ETS buyers are ensuring that all requests are approved by Rod.  To help Rod out it would be in your best interest to state a business need for the requested purchase as well as company, cost center and under which category in the budget the item was budgeted for (Approved Project Number; Blanket number; expense GL acct (52504500 - pc equipment), etc.  Rod should be the last in the chain for approvals. IT should proceed with its normal chain of approval (supervisor, Director, VP etc.) prior to being sent to Rod for his final approval.   All iPayit items must be coded and sent to Rod Hayslett for final approval.  As in the iBuyit system, Rod should be the last in the chain for approvals.  All internal approvals and checking for correct coding should be completed prior to being sent to Rod for his final approval.   All IT Employee Expense reports must be coded and sent to Shelley Corman for final approval.  All internal approvals and checking for correct coding should be completed prior to being sent to Shelley for her final approval.   Other Items: ? All invoices should be processed in iPayit and should be sent to accounts payable far enough in advance so that they may be processed in the system. ? For invoices that must be paid in 2-7 days, sign-off from the following is required - Shelley Corman, Rod Hayslett, and a Cash Management Committee member (see me and I will help walk you through the rest once sign off is received from Shelley and Rod).  Urgent Payment Request form filled out. ? For same day payment, sign off from the following is required - Shelley Corman, Rod Hayslett, and George Wasaff.  The cut off time for sending current day payments to the AP processing team is 12:00 noon and for next day payments 3:00pm.  Again see me after signatures and I will walk you through the process. Urgent Payment request Form filled out. ? Urgent Payment Request Forms are located on the ISC Website and the iBuyit website.  These forms are used for all exception payments i.e. payments outside of iPayit.  I hope this helps.   cvb    ",

TW will have their morning meeting in EB1336 Mondy through Friday at 8:00 a.m. beginning, Monday, January 21, 2002. TW schedulers will attend this meeting. 2.  Gas Logistics will be sure either Steve January, Darrell Schoolcraft or Gary Spraggins is in attendance for Gas Control and either Lynn Blair, Terry Kowalke or John Buchanan is in attendance for scheduling discussions. 3.  On Fridays at 3:00 p.m., beginning Friday, January 25, 2002, there will be a meeting in EB1336 to review any TW issues for the weekend.  Marketing and Gas Logistics will be in attendance. 4.  Beginning this weekend, Saturday, January 12, 2002,  on Saturday and Sunday, if there are any TW issues that need to be discuss, Gas Logistics will call the appropriate Marketing On Call person after the NNG 8:00 morning meeting. 5.  NNG will continue to have their Marketing/Gas Logistics morning meeting in EB42C2 Monday through Friday and the Conference call at 8:00 a.m. on Satruday and Sunday. 6.  The TW Schedulers will attend the meeting at EB1336 Monday through Friday.  On Saturday and Sunday, they will be in the NNG morning meeting conference call and stay on the line for the TW meeting if it is necessary to have one.  We are continuing to include the TW schedulers on the conference call due to discussions about system issues which impact both pipelines.   If anyone has any questions, or would like to discuss any changes, please let Kim Watson or I know and we can certainly look at other options.     I apologize this did not get started this last Friday, but I believe everyone has it on their calendars now.   Thanks for everyones help and support to come up with a solution that hopefully works for all.   Lynn    ",

I would like to add that we got the benefit of this method of calculating prejudgment interest because the arbitrators specifically adopted Northern's prejudgment interest methodology, which was based on the fine work Harry, Tangi and you did on our post-hearing briefs.      Of even more significance,  the panel specifically noted KN's course of performance of using our meter numbers for its monthly plant settlements when the panel rejected ONEOK's argument that ONEOK had never \"accepted\" the meters.  Harry and Tangi brought this evidence to our attention at the outset of this litigation, and it became a centerpiece argument for us. With their and your fine work (and the unbelievable hours all of you put in, late at night, early in the morning, on the weekends, and frequently on an emergency basis, with little or no notice), you made ONEOK's attorneys very unhappy with your testimony at the hearing.

I sent three signed and notarized copies -- so you have a few extras to play with.    Here is the missing language   STATE OF TEXAS   COUNTY OF HARRIS  Sworn and subscribed before me on this 26th day of November, 2001.    My conversation with Chris was quite different than my conversation with Ginger.  While she said that it would be more convenient if we set a date like Jan 5 to travel to be able to buy the tickets in advance and hopefully get better fares.  She also acted like it is not out of the question that travel around Dec 17 might be possible if one didn't mind being away at Christmas.  On my voice mail she left a message that my dossier had been received in Astana.  When I called her back she said that this was a mistake -- that what she meant was that it had been picked up at the embassy and was expected in Astana on Thurs or Fri.

		"_body" : "Dale and I joined in on an INGAA conference call this morning. There were many parties (maybe 30) on the line, but I didn't hear anyone else identify themselves from Enron. The topic of the call was enhanced security for facilities in light of the recent events, and a small discussion related to the recent \"worm\" problems. The discussion was led by Terry Boss and someone named Greg from INGAA, whose last name I didn't catch.  The gist of the meeting was that there has been a Security Task Group identifed. Names and companies participating were not given on the call.    INGAA wants the goal of this group to achieve consistent and effective communications to the various Government agencies with regard to steps being taken to enhance security. The agencies identified that will have a say in this are: DOT, DOE, FERC, and the new Home Defense agency. Four other goals were listed: 1) Determine how to achieve cost recovery          2) Share Best Practices                     3) Research and Development          4) Public Communication and Education  There was a discussion to determine if companies would be willing to share best practices in this area. Several companies, Iroquois, Williston Basin, Trans Canada, Williams, El Paso, Duke indicated that they would be willing to share. At that point several companies volunteered what they have done. It ranged from the extreme--Iroquois is manning all facilities, putting new and tougher chains and locks on valves and gates, security cameras at all facilities, etc. to El Paso, which indicated they are studying several things but for the most part they are on \"heightened awareness.\"   Concerning the virus or worm in the SCADA system, it appears that systems utilizing UNIX are vulnerable if they also have some interaction with the Internet. No solution or fix was discussed. The effects of contamination are missing data from the RTU's and inability to send setpoints.  Steve",

Please print and bring these with you to the meeting.    This is the agenda for the meeting.  Please review and note if you are being requested to provide an update.     This file contains the 2001 and 2002 PHYSICAL results.  Please note the sheet entitled \"NNG 2001 & 2002 DTH Comparison\".  As you can see, the results for the past several months have been less than satisfactory.     Oct 2001 (724,672  MMBtu)  loss or .65%  Nov 2001 (352,858  MMBtu)  loss or .33%  Dec 2001 (869,987  MMBtu)  loss or .69%  Jan 2002 (827,225  MMBtu)  loss or .61%  We will spend some time discussing these results. GMS and the Measurement Specialists (along with the Regional UAF teams) will be asked for an update on what review efforts have  taken place to date in an effort to identify the reasons for the losses, and a report on the efforts that are on-going or anticipated.  Timelines and completion dates will be expected.  We will also be developing some review actions and initiatives for the future.  Please be prepared to provide an update if your name is on the agenda.      This document, and its intended use,  will be discussed in the meeting    I am providing this document as a reminder of the accountabilities and responsibly we agreed to late in 2000.  Obviously we are all in  this together - BUT, someone must take the lead to ensure what needs to be done, gets done.  Hence this matrix. ",

With respect to the issue of market power, the current record is   not considered to be complete. However, FERC will schedule a hearing to   complete and review the record.",

GISB has since adopted standardized data formats for the transactional reporting, recently published in GISB version 1.5 standards.  While these standard formats have been adopted, and I believe that we are following these formats, they haven't yet been adopted by FERC -- so other pipelines may or may not yet be following.

As directed, the tariff sheets removed  the daily  high/low index price for cash-out.  In response, Texas Gas proposes to establish a cash-out price based on a weekly high/low index price determined from the weeks within the applicable month, plus the first week of the following month.  The primary and alternate sheets require in-kind make-up  of imbalances up to 2% and use the same index price  for  imbalances  above 5%. However,  the primary sheets also propose to eliminate cash-out for all imbalances up to  5%  by also requiring a mandatory in-kind make-up level from 2% to 5% and by eliminating any use of the 100% price index for this tier of imbalance.  Texas Gas states that copies of  the revised  tariff sheets are being mailed to Texas  Gas's  jurisdictional customers and interested state commissions.  Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Section 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations.  All such protests must be filed in accordance with Section 154.210 of the Commission's Regulations.  Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings.  Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. This filing may also be viewed on the web at http://www.ferc.gov using the \"RIMS\" link, select \"Docket#\" and follow the instructions  (call 202-208-2222 for assistance).  Comments, protests and interventions may be filed electronically via the Internet in lieu of paper.

		"_body" : "Shelley, I have been looking throught Galen's numbers for July 01 and I have found four cash out payments with quantities totaling 1,457,146 mmbtus.  These were payments to Dynegy and Texaco Natural Gas.  I am running the invoice log to see if it will tell me what kind of payments these were -- I suspect these are for ParkNRide and maybe OBA cash outs in the supply area.   Shown below (and also attached) is a spreadsheet to reconcile the July 01 numbers.   Galen, I think we will need for you to go back through the numbers you provided for each month and exclude any quantities that have to do with PNR and with supply area OBA cash in/out payments.     I will still need to reconcile the original market area imbalance numbers that I provided earlier with any PPAs and other adjustments that are included in the Balance Before Bookout imbalance quantities for each month.  My original list of market area imbalance quantities did not include any PPAs.

		"_body" : "For Internal use only   Sixth Interstate Natural Gas Facility-Planning Seminar \"Presentation of Staff's Findings\" October 26, 2001 Washington, DC  Link to \"Ideas\" document:  http://www.ferc.gov/gas/stakeholder.pdf _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _   Comments due on pre-filing stakeholder \"Ideas\" document November 9 Overriding theme to all Action Ideas is \"earlier is better\" Pre-filing process has a new docket prefix (PF) and is underway; explained in some detail Staff seems to be looking for best practices, possibly even a vehicle for industry-wide (and public) sharing    Highlights  Though FERC's Office of Energy Projects intends to hold more public and industry outreach seminars, this sixth seminar was the last of this series; OEP presented their final draft of \"Ideas for Better Stakeholder Involvement in the Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Planning Pre-Filing Process: Industry, Agencies, Citizens and FERC Staff.\"    Following this presentation, there is one last round of comments on the document due to the Outreach Team by November 9th.  The Outreach Team's goal is to release a final document by the end of this year.  Overall, the Team wants to know if they're findings are on target, and they have asked for comments that include edits, additions or omissions.  To note, however, is that \"The Ideas\" is seen as a \"living document\" by OEP, and it will be changed and updated on an ongoing basis as better practices and ideas emerge.  Again Rich Hoffmann stated that there is no intention for any of this to be included in a rulemaking or policy statement (I believed him this time).   Also, Rich clarified that \"we recognize these ideas have to be customized for every project.\"  [This is, in fact, why the document was not issued as \"guidelines\" -- industry argued they would become de facto requirements.]  For comment on the document itself, we will look for ETS recommendations from interested groups (there is a link to the document above).  At the end of this memo, there is also a list of general questions from the Outreach Team.  Please send replies or comments on those questions, as well as the \"Ideas\" document, to me by November 7th for aggregation and inclusion in informal comments to go to the Outreach team (comments will not be filed with the Secretary).  FERC Staff Presentation  The Gas Outreach Team (Rich Hoffmann, Lauren O'Donnell, Jeff Shenot, Howard Wheeler) presented their findings of Action Options for the four major stakeholder sectors: Pipeline Industry, Agency (local, state and resource agencies), Citizen and FERC Staff.  There is a slide presentation that should be made available online soon.    There was some Q&A, but Staff was particularly eager to hear examples of how some of these ideas have been implemented successfully and if any \"best practices\" have emerged since the Outreach Team began these discussions.  One worry we have with Staff's preoccupation with best practices is that, at some point, they may want to formalize that idea though the publication of best practices.  They seem to be looking for a vehicle to collect and communicate best practices from pipeline company to pipeline company, and to the public.  Similar to the idea of publishing guidelines which then become de facto requirements, \"best practices\" can evolve into requirements as well, and such practices vary widely in use and effectiveness across different systems, projects and regions of the country.  Industry may want to protect the importance of variability and customization of approach based on what we know about certain regions and populations.  Some points of interest from the discussion include the emphasis by FERC Staff that pipeline companies appear to be most successful when they get full management support from the top at the very beginning of project development, there is a proactive company-wide philosophy, and the project team includes various parts of the company from the outset (i.e., include public affairs from the beginning as well as engineering, and have them communicate with each other regularly through the team).  NEPA Pre-Filing Process  Attesting to the emerging role of the NEPA Pre-filing Process, there is a new docket prefix, \"PF,\" instituted to allow for public access to information on pre-filed projects.  This process is not an expedited approach that takes less time at FERC, but instead overlays the company's timeline with the FERC NEPA timeline in the development and assessment of the project.  This allows for a certificate sooner for the company in relation to their own project development process.  As an example, a NEPA Pre-Filing process could begin before the exact route has been determined, though the project must be well-defined -- while the company is holding public meetings and choosing the route, FERC could begin the scoping process.  According to OEP's assessment, this could shift the NEPA process back as much as seven months.  Under this scenario, once the company files for its certificate application, a final certificate could be issued in under ten months.  In order to use the pre-filing process, companies must meet certain qualifications.  First, a company should be prepared to fund a third party contractor to help FERC Staff prepare the certificate and NEPA requirements.  Also, there must be a real written commitment to identify and resolve issues.  And the company must be able to demonstrate that the other major NEPA organizations are prepared to cooperate on development of the NEPA assessment.  To qualify to use the NEPA pre-filing, the company files a formal request with the OEP Director answering any concerns FERC Staff may have about the project and the outlook for a successful pre-filing process.  Once accepted, that would trigger the PF docket assignment.  Currently, only the NiSource Greenbriar project is utilizing this process.   Follow-Up Questions from FERC  Along with any comments we may have on the \"Ideas\" document itself, FERC Staff distributed a set of three questions for consideration and/or comment from industry and the public.  The questions follow  -- note that Staff is particularly eager to collect positive anecdotes on how these ideas are already working on projects:  Part 1: Are we on target?  [Please let us know of any additions, omissions, or editorial changes you recommend for \"Ideas for Better Stakeholder Involvement...\"] Part 2:  Ideas for implementation  [Please give us your good ideas about how to put the ideas discussed here today to work.  This can be for projects you are involved with or for other projects of which you are aware.] Part 3: Examples of successful implementation [Please describe examples of how using these concepts helped make your experience or involvement with a project better.] ",

		"_body" : "Gary,    Yesterdays elevator problem was caused initially by a broken belt on the governor on Car # 21. This controls the speed of the car, and the car is designed to stop where it is if something happens to the governor rather than risk an overspeed condition. We have had the car thoroughly checked over today to see what else we could determine about yesterdays problems. The intercom in this car does not work, but the alarm bell does work. I can't explain why no one heard the bell. We have taken the car out of service until the intercom is repaired.    There have been several changes within the Maintenance Department since the bankruptcy in December, but none that should have impacted the maintenance levels of the elevators. We have eliminated the 24 x 7 on site coverage by the Maintenance Department, and returned to an on call arrangement which we previously had until about a year ago. We had to reduce the size of our staff as did everyone else, and simply do not have enough people to adequately staff 24 x 7 any longer. We also had two full time Elevator Mechanics on site Monday through Friday during our peak. That, however, was when we had over 8,000 people in the building. During that time we had a lot of problems just because of the extremely heavy usage. Now that we have fewer than 3,000 people here, the usage does not warrant two full time mechanics, so we have cut back to one. The routine maintenance on the elevators is still accomplished on schedule by the one mechanic. Most of the other high rise buildings in town have either one or none. In the past the second mechanic was tied up with trouble calls which we have very few of now.     While it is not required by code, we have always made it an internal practice to do a physical inspection of all of the elevators and test all of their functions on a weekly basis. This is generally accomplished by Security or Maintenance either on Friday or Saturday after hours, as you must recall them to the lobby to do this. The inspections were not completed this past Saturday. This would normally not be a significant issue, as routines are interrupted from time to time due to other occurring problems. Unfortunately this time it was significant.     This past Sunday has pointed out several procedural issues that either need corrected or reviewed with our support personnel. I do not know what time it was determined that someone was stuck in the elevator, but Security contacted our on call person at approximately 11:45 A.M. The on call Tech then proceeded to the building arriving at about 12:25 P.M. Our person tried unsuccessfully to reset the elevator, and when that was not possible, he asked Security if Schindler was on their way. It was at that point the he learned that Schindler had not been contacted yet. Security then called Schindler at 12:37 p.m. and Schindler contacted their mechanic at 12:44 p.m. The Schindler tech arrived on site at 1:45 p.m. and had the person out of the elevator about 2:20 p.m. It is standing procedure for Security to contact Schindler immediately in the event of an entrapment. Failure to do this resulted in an extra hour before help arrived.    I am reviewing procedures with the Security Supervisor to insure there are no delays in contacting the elevator service immediately in cases of an entrapment. We are also reviewing the routine inspection procedures on the elevators to insure that they are inspected weekly and taken out of service if the intercom does not work properly. Security will remain responsible for these inspections since they have people here at night.      I sincerely regret the extreme inconvenience your employee went through yesterday, and I assure you we are taking every precaution to insure this does not happen again. Elevators will occasionally break, and there will occasionally be an entrapment, but 5 hours and no ability to communicate is not acceptable.    Randy",
